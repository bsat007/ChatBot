Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
That's because it's such a nice one.
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
I was?
You always been this selfish?
They do not!
Expensive?
Hi, Joey.
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
You're welcome.
What?
So did you
You set me up.
What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse.  They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.
That's what I just said
I thought you hated those people.
It's a lung cancer issue
I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.
So what does that give me?  I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?
It's off. The whole thing.
She's partial to Joey, not me
She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.
Fifty, and you've got your man.
I'm on it
Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
Does this conversation have a purpose?
You could always go with me.  I'm sure William has some friends.
William would never have gone to a state school.
Oh, good.  Something new and different for us.
Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.
My mission in life.
Oh, right.  Friday.
And why would I do that?
That's what you want, isn't it?
Funny, you're the only one
I'm fine. I'm
Busy
Then why'd you ask?
My father wouldn't approve of that that
I'm gettin' there
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
Acting the way we do.
Go to the prom with me
So I have to have a motive to be with you?
It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
Because I like to torture you.
I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.
Because you're making decisions for me.
Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.
Parts of it.
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the term used most often.
Hi.
Yeah.  I guess.
Oh yeah.
Yeah...
Yeah.
It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...
Make anyone cry today?
Tumescent!
Kissing?  Is that what you think happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.
Dr. Ruth?
Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
We'll all go crazy...
Excellency, you are right.
Indeed.  The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them.  My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.
On the contrary, Your Eminence.  It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
I know.
Thank God...
I can't keep my eyes off you.  I would like to catch up with all the moments I didn't spend with you.
He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
... for a commoner?
What...?  Do I have so many already?
Tell the Chief we thank him.
Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
Thousands.
Chief says...
You did the same to your God!
With some difficulty.  I had to promise them you were not a total fool.
To open a new route to Asia.  At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it...
I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.
Oh?  So you are a new man?
Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?
And then what?  Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
You bring the cigarettes?
No, he is here.  Shit...
No.  No way.
Your father put cigarettes out on you?
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
They won't until this is over.
So...the station is empty?
I'm just trying to find out who you are.
Go on.
I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.
You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours.
What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'
Oh really.  That's nice.  You took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot?  Are you out of your fucking mind??  Are you having that much trouble gettin' dates?!
Okay.  But not water sports.
Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
Yeah.
What's the kid gonna say - sorry? Meanwhile I'm not here anymore. Like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan. Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk.  Who knows?  But some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and I'm thinkin' that's me. Sooner or later.  That's me.
We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.
Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
Did you tell him you did?
He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!
No, we don't mind.  You mind Leon?
Nah, why should you?
Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?
There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.
This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.
I'll call it... tails.
She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
Something back home?
What would your girlfriend think of that?
My point exactly.
No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it.  I mean, to say the least, you outta know better.  You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead.
Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me.  So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now?
There are two bodies found at this point.
We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know.
I can't talk right now.  We have some things to take care of.
He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll be fine.
I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
Could be Leon's.
That's good.
Well, that's great.
Yeah, yeah.  Good thing.
Dog food.
No.  Are you proposing?
I like to talk to the person who runs the service.  Can you give me address?
Two weeks holiday.
Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
Million?!  The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
Don't speak Russian!
I'll do it.  Don't hurt my camera!
Don't want to film this?
And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry.
What does it look like?  It's an address book!
Good idea!
Shut up.  Look!
Credit?
No, I don't get that!
Did you hurt her?
Milos.  Get my money!
As a plumber?!
Paulie, you've got kids, right?
What do you mean you know?  He told you he was gonna propose to me?
Alright.  Go ahead.
Okay.  You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national.  How do you know one another?
Yes, we're in New York now.  But where are you planning to stay in New York?
What are you coming here to do?
Thanks.  Appreciate it.
Evidence.  Of a homicide.
Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights!
Oh yeah, why?
Yeah?
Aren't you tired?
It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!
What the hell happened?
Your doctor?
...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
No. I never did, either.
But not completely inconceivable?
Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
Well, I hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those. Other- wise we're out of business.
Yes.
He's got a point.
Sure, Dave, what's up?
Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.
It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.
I'm fine, Daddy. When are you coming home?
Yes, I know that sweetheart.
She's in the bathroom.
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
I'll bet it's a fortune.
Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.
Fine.
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
Well, I'm glad about that.
No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.
Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?
Hal, I'm going out now to replace the A.O. unit.
Let me see the tracking alignment display.
Great, just great.
Try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and I won't have to hassle you...
Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?
Here's hoping, baby...
Would you guys...
Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...
You're done.  End of story.
Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.
You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.
You just don't get it, do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass.
What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
Thank you.
I think you better put him on ice, man.
Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.
Mission District.  Gonna find us an Indian.
Last night, two nights ago, three?
You have a good time?
But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
What are you talkin' about?
I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.
My kind of place. I always liked country boys.
While you're at it, You can give me the switchblade, too.
I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
One thing's for sure, Jack. That's how you'll tell the story.
How much?
Jesus.
Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.
You're a real case, you know that, Jack?
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
What about Ganz?
Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it.
I can just take her right across the street to Luther's hotel.  All I need is some money for the room.
I don't know about you, but I could use a drink... I'll buy you one.  It'll be my good-bye present.
Don't worry about it.
Yeah, too bad.  They were real nice lookin' too...In bed together, hardly any clothes one watching TV...
If she's right, and if you don't screw up.
Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine.  You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps...
Partnership?
Spare met Jack. I'm into legit investments from here on in.
Yeah, I read the report...
Jack?
Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
Hey ... Dick Tracy.
Here's the file. Cates checks the file.
Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.
You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.
I don't answer questions, I ask 'em...
Hey, you know what I really think?
That's the way I see it, too.
Jack?  What was that?
I've been better...Dead end.  No Ganz, no Indian.
Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...
Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type.  But this Indian...
Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
In all due respect, he sounds kind of pathetic to me.  The kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend.  Have you two ace detectives checked that out?
Alright, I'm coming...hold on.
Yeah, old times.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
No! Don't kill her.  I can get you the money.
First, the money.
Naw, right here's okay.
You noticed...
So you do know her.
I know. I was there when she arrived.
Good luck..
Father, I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends. So thanks for the offer.. but no thanks.
Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
One more reason to shoot first eh?
White turns to black.  Light to Dark. Life to Death.  For all eternity.
Thank you, Mr. President.
What is?
Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!
Perfect.
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!
Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
They are... with me...
You forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions. I know how you drive.
When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
You little sleaze bag!
Don't you ever ask me for another thing in my life again, you've killed your poor mother with your own hands!
This is a police control action..
He's on vacation.
I'll be right back.
What mission?
And the third one?
I've had enough good news for today
Three of us will never fit in there!
Not hard to find you...just follow the Chaos...
Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?
And you can't concentrate with me around?.
The words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. I won't be long.
I told you not to read all that crap!
I want to sleep... forever...
You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...
Because...
I love you...
The last two messages I got?  The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife.
Good philosophy..see good in bad.. I like..I prepare number one dessert.. special for you and pussy..
Been here long?
This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered.
Recommendations.
Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.
Got it.
Do you know how much I missed you?
Sure.  I'll call the guy.
Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully..
I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop.
What can I do for you today?
Hmm.
Yes.  What we're looking for is rather specific.
Is it?
Right here.
Look, I don't know what this...
I remember him.
How cooperative.  Longdale will keep you company.
You betrayed us.
What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive.  And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...
I'm not so sure about this.
Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry.
You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?
I don't know...
Nobody saw you bring her in?
Where do you think you're taking this, huh?  Gonna be a big hero, avenge that little girl's death? Gonna make everything right with the world?  How you gonna do that... ?
Stop talking.
Show me where you buried her.
I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?
I'm listening.
Of what sort?
Shut up.
I tear off the cover and paste this one on...  You know how it is.
Might get drummed out of the pornographer's union, and then where would I be?
There's not much illegal.
Sounds good, pops.
Interesting theory.
See ya.
It's their Presidential Suite.
It's cheap, and people know to mind their own business. What have you got for me?
I'm trying to figure that out myself.  I have to see Machine without his mask.
It's money.  People use it to purchase goods and services.
It's not my money.  The woman I got it from is never going to give it a second thought.  Let's not make a big deal out of this, okay?  Go be a race car driver.  Go run for President.  Whatever.
Thank you.
I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to.  Other than that, there's never any reason.
I'm telling you it's not that.
Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later, anonymously.  I've thought about it and there's no other way.  If you can't find them... if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for, well I can't let that happen.  I'm telling you I won't.  If there's no chance that poor girl's memory can be served, then I'll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her.
Okay, I follow you so far...
Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?
I've made progress.  I'm in Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update.
Neil... Neil Cole.
They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?
It got to be too much for him.
Of course.
We're all like that.
No.
Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...
Who are you?
No...
Why... why are you doing this to me... ?
None too discreet, is he?
What?
I don't want to.
What?
Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.
How'd you learn so much about dreams?
Saw who? I was up all night cramming for this physics test, and I was putting this little baby together.  Look...
It was no suicide.  It was not an accident.  It was Freddy, and he's coming back for seconds, thirds, and fourths.
The story is, the deaths you can't argue with.
Who?
It's okay, we're just about there.
Something's wrong here.  It feels like...
Debbie.  She's gone.  I've...collected her, like the others.
Alright, I think I see salvation...
Give her time.  Beauty is skin deep.
It was Freddy.
How she doing?  I ran into her last night.
Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
Avoid-all-contact-day.
Oh God!  He killed them!
What I what?  Well, I've thought about it.  I plan to keep him.
He says it's easy.  Especially with sad people.  With closed-off people.
I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  "The drunk showed up", that kind of thing...
No.  A deal's a deal.
It's the model you've been saving up for. I wanted you to have it for your trip.
Alice...
But Dad --
Alice, it's no dream.  I'm sorry...Dan's dead.
They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.
So did Dan.
That's okay.  He's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep.
Well we gotta do something!
I don't know!
Then we'll find another way.
But I've seen her grave.
She killed herself.  Her soul's gonna be in torment.
Next life.  Oh, what's that?
Who?
Naah, I'm done.  Got to be on shift in a couple hours.  Aren't you going in?
I can't listen to this.
Dead?  Matter of fact, he's much better. He's left the hospital.
Your father can be in Nome, Alaska, tomorrow.  We have two choices: Ask them to send him out in a 'copter', and take you off, or the Shark can put back into Nome...
You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
Then...this is a 'flying saucer?'
I wouldn't worry.  So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark - and people like you, the Skipper, Dave, Kent, Sir Ian and my father -
So they caught up with you, too?
<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?
Disappointing a <u>big</u> girl!
Sounds like it!  Distress call, from a small freighter, between Ellesmere Island and Greenland. One mayday, then...nothing.
'Us?'
Go back and tell Dr. Neilsen. Have him report to the Skipper.
Strange you didn't hear it. OMIT 274F
The sound again?
What's goin' on in here, Lad? What - ?
Right at our one-eyed friend!
Wonderful!
Under <u>water</u>?
That's what I said!
It's the screws, Skipper.  At our declination angle, running in reverse, they're pulling the Shark <u>and</u> Cyclops right to the bottom.
Minus three.
Come where?
That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
Thank you.
Toward the Pole!
All right - go to it.
What is the Northcountry Development Association?
Twombley involved?
How soon?
Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.
Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.
Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I?
You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.
Yeah?
Sun's gettin high.
A half mile in, along the old lumber road.
Yeah.
Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off.
Yeah.
Lawford?
Look. Those kids are still trick-or- treating. They're still out.
To us it was.
I don't want to.
It's stupid.
I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home.
Yes.
See, I knew you'd be mad.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
That's fine with me too. When Mommy comes, tell her I'm up here.
I'm glad you're here. Can you stay for a while?
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
Grandpa. My father. It's his.
Nothing.
Okay.
I know.
At the school crossing. In his BMW. Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna bust his ass.
You want me to follow them to Littleton?
I'm fine, fine.
You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?
Could be.
Yeah.
Let the past be.  I'm sorry about your mother. I liked her. You never know how much women like that suffer. It's like they live their lives with the sound turned off -- and then they're gone.
Forget it.
Jack doesn't need money.
But not now.
I'm her father -- supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight.
Don't be silly. Hi, Jill.
I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?
Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer.
No, I... I've been out on the grader all morning. Twombley's summer people. Massachusetts. Friend of Gordon's. It was his idea for Jack to take him hunting.  I gotta go.
His office. You mean my old office.
In the living room.
Bang!
I don't know you. My goddamn father and I don't know you.
That it wasn't an accident.
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age.
Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?
That's the way of the world, little one. Didn't they teach you that in school?
It would be a pity to squander such a strong personality.
It was the experience of a lifetime.
It's okay, honey. I got you. I got you. You're okay.
Did we warn them off?
They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.
I'm doing what I can.
Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.
Goddamn right I did.  I asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit.  What's the point in having a speech if I have to ad-lib?
An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz back in.
Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.
To swear you in as President.
why did they do that?
Where are we now?
Thank you.
Maria... Maria Mitchell.
Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.
What do you want with us?
No.
You will be the first to pay for that mistake.
Please. You can kill me but leave my daughter alone.
You heard me.  You. Congress and cabinet heads.
Gravity.
We can't jump from here or at this speed. But if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane...
Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.
Can't it wait?
Rose, I don't have time for this.
But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
White House Situation room.
Actually, sir, you could be that someone.
This is the President.
No. no. no. Wait. Wait.
I might still have a few chips left.
This is a crime bill, Shep.  Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee.  Besides, Shep, I told you...  I don't shoot babies and I don't kiss guns.
That's my job.
They better. Fuel's almost gone.
Bud, get wise to the political realities. The boys on the board are under a lot of pressure from the boys downtown.
Yes I did...
Um...  Do you people scream right when you... you know.
You better check it, Unger.
Sir?
Ted, I loved you and I'll always love you. But I need Simon.  He's stable.  He's a good provider.  I want that at this stage of the game, Ted.  He might have his faults, but Simon doesn't know the meaning of the word fear and I need that in a man.
Let me by, Elaine.
Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.
Ted!
That was very well put, Ted.
I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
Not when I'm with you, Ted.
And I can hardly believe that I'm engaged to someone like you, Simon.  I'm a very lucky woman.
I think so.
Negative.
I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.
Yeah.
We've spent everything on these operations.  Is it really worth it?  We've pawned your mother's wedding ring.  The kids have no winter clothes...
You're sure?
Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.
What should I say?
Yes.
You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
Don't try to stop me!
I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.
That's very nice of you. Thank you.
Thank you. Cream?
No, I mean we can't <u>land</u> for another two hours. Fog has closed down everything this side of the mountains. We've got to go through to Chicago!
I think you ought to know what our chances are. The life of everyone on board depends on just one thing: finding someone back there who not only can fly this plane, but who didn't have fish for dinner.
Ted!
Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.
Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.
Yes?
Joey can stay up here for a while if he'd like to.
Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind.
You are now eight miles from the airport. Turn right to a heading of zero eight niner, throttle back slightly and begin to lose altitude to fifteen hundred feet.
I think you should go back to your seat now, Joey. Right, Clarence?
I will, but Jim won't.
Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?
Roger, Roger. What's our vector, Victor?
Oh -- I haven't flown for a long time.
Does that cost extra or you throw them in?
Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later.
You ever try to make a case in Slagtown?  The list of Newcomer informants is about as long as the list of Mexican war heroes...
No, Sergeant -- not history...  Eternity...
His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown.
Through the chest.  Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts.
Yes.
Shouldn't we examine their personal effects?
And that fits?
How the hell do you know that?
So the Slag they're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like Hubley worked at a refinery.  I'd say that "possible" connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible.  Okay, next step -- I gotta go talk to the wife of the Slag store owner blown away last night.
My partner is dead!  Because one of you bastards killed him -- then disappeared into a rathole down in Slagtown, where he's home and dry, 'cause nobody sees nothing, nobody says nothing...
Uh, Matthew...
Your mother mates out of season.
From quarantine, when my people first arrived here.  He and I were housed together.
Three months.  We learn quickly.  We adapt.  It is our strength... what we were bred for, to adapt to hostile environments.
When will Strader return?
Through his ass.  Next time you see him, tell him to call me... unless you want us to keep coming back on you like a bad case of herpes.
Maybe not... I don't know.  I'm not sure I'm gonna go.  She doesn't need her burn-out of a father there...
Yeah, go home.  Get some sleep.  You do sleep, don't you?
Why?
Come on, you won't have to get near the water.
Thank you.
I must trust you, Matthew.  I cannot stop this without you.
Harcourt was the brain who brought it all together.
Where is the drug?  Where have they taken it?
There!  Go back.  Down that side street.
... It's Harcourt.
Because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.
Yes it is.  Thirty-five percent pure Methane gas in there.  I don't know how these fellas do it.
Sure.  Just a minute.
Yeah, I'll bet.
Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car.
I can't!  Do you mind!
Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.
I'm afraid so.  The crash did too much damage.  The overload is inevitable, at this point.
You'd drifted right through the core systems.  It's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right?
Amanda Ripley-McClaren.  Married name, I guess.  Age:  sixty-six ...at time of death.  Two years ago.  I'm sorry.
What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?
Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever.
You sent them to that ship.  I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J.
Sorry to disappoint you.
PDT'S.  Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.
Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?
You tell me.  I only work here.
Are you finished?  You okay?
Aye-firmative.
Poor bastard.
We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.
Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.
Maybe.  Maybe not.
Stand back.
Look, man, let's just bug out and call it even, okay?
Hudson, give us a break.
Oh, God.  Jesus.  This ain't happening.
Oh, right!  Right!  With those things running around.  No way.
Seal the door.
Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his.
Terrible.
How long have I been on Gateway station?
Newt.  My n-name's Newt. Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother.
What about me?
They're dead.
You promise?
The 'maze'?  You mean the air ducts?
Why do they tell little kids that?
Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?
I'll be right in the other room, Newt.  And look...I can see you on that camera right up there.
I know, honey.  Me too.
Newt, wait!
I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely. But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. I need to net one birdie only But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade.  To a ghost I must fade! To a ghost I must fade!
Indeed.
Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip.
Yes.
No.
Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?
In a harem.
A brothel.
Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.
Excuse us, Fraulein. Good night, Signore.
I want to go!
We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg.
No, no. Say it backwards, shit-wit. Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards!
No!
I love you! I love you!
Tea? Who wants tea? Let's go out! This calls for a feast. You don't want tea, Papa. Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties, don't you?
Wolfi.
These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!
I'm not telling you.
Please! Let me sit here. Let me stay here with you. I promise I won't say all word. I'll just be here, so you know no one's going to hurt you. Please, please!
I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.
My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.
Don't keep calling me that. It puts me at such a distance. I was not born a Court Composer, you know. I'm from a small town, just like your husband.
That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals.
Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.
He asked me to stay.
Money! Money!
Oh yes, and who are you? He's worked for Kings. For the Emperor.  Who are you?
And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?
Hey!
I am sorry, Madame. It is not permitted.
Young man, I am no stranger to theatres. I'm no stranger to insolence!
Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say?
You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea.
Majesty, I did. Believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally, I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart.
Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo!
Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto!
In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.
Yes, indeed.
He's here.
Oh, yes. Oh, I mean no - not exactly like this. I mean today - just today, Stanzi - I remember now. She had to go - yes! She had to help her mother. Yes, she's like that. Her mother's a very sweet woman, you'll see.
Don't you have a maid?
They say you're in debt.
Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all?
Really? What is it he's writing?
Yes what?
I don't know. He has pains.
Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!
Animals?
Wolfi!
Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished?
What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?
Really?
Did you like it, then?
Your Excellency, you requested some specimens of my work. Here they are. I don't have to tell you how much I need your help. I truly appreciate your looking at these. I have pressures on me - financial pressures. As you know, I'm a married man now.
She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know.
Why? Here is the music. It's here. I am submitting it humbly. Isn't that what you wanted?
Forgive me. We all have patriotic feelings of some kind.
I don't think you should become known in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart. However, I know a very distinguished gentleman I could recommend to you. And he has a daughter. Will that do?
It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.
Thank you! Oh, thank you.
How could I not?
I never knew that music like that was possible.
How much?
I mean to come to my opera. You are the only colleague who did.
No! No, it's him!
Of course.
What?
Come. Let's begin.
What time?
I think so.
Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?
You go fast!
Oh no. I'm not tired at all.
I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
Well not especially. It can be in Turkish, if you really want. I don't care.
Certainly, Herr Director.
Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
Taking out what you should never have put in.
On the contrary.
May I just do that, Majesty? Show you how it begins? Just that?
You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?
Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.
Do you believe it?
Did you try?
God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the salt of penitence. He will give you back the bread of eternal life. He is all merciful. That is all you need to know.
His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God, forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for once, laughing at Him. Do you understand? Do you?
I poisoned his life.
No, Father. From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me. Whenever they say Mozart with love, they'll have to say Salieri with loathing. And that's my immortality - at last! Our names will  be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy. At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me, your merciful God!
Incredible.
Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
Did we?
For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France.
I can't wait.
Oh, I'm tender enough for you, my boy. I'm tender enough for you.
I agree, Baron.
Who is she?
Yes.  And congratulations to all of you. It was superb.
What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
He said 'Jack'.
They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.
Let's call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy.
The zoo? Is he rational?
How is that?
I thought you were asleep.
'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.
It's okay. I want to talk to you.
That's not really a very proper question.
I know.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Will you come with me?
I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.
Your dead friend Jack?
What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?
I would think so.
Very nice.
Charming.
There is only one bed.
It's nice to see you.
Of course.
I'm freezing.
What?
I swear, I don't know this girl.
Why on earth do you say that?
You've left my wife a widow and my children fatherless. And I understand that I am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf's bloodline is severed and the curse lifted.
Quiet, everyone! Hush! Shhh!
I was having a nightmare.
In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.
Did you see Jack?
Of course not, David. I'll fetch in young Miss Price.
We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?
I assume full responsibility.
Shall we?
It's a five-pointed star.
Wrong.
I have no idea.
I'm well aware of how pleasant the weather is in Rome at the present time thank you.
I heard that.
Yeah?
Pecos Bill.
It's circling us.
Plan?
No.
Are you going to help me up?
Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger!
Rudy Levine the shmuck?
I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know.
What?!
What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!
Hi, David.
You don't have to say anything.
I want you to meet some people.
Hello.
Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors?
Stay here. If we need you, we'll know where to reach you.
Roger Mathison, Doctor.
I suppose Guinness will suffice.
No.
We've got spirits and beer. If it's something hot you want, you can have tea.
But I can heat some up for you if you'd like.
Sgt. McManus, are you suggesting that David and Jack were, in fact, attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of East Proctor has conspired to keep it a secret? We have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police. We have two witnesses to the crime. You'll forgive me, Mr. Kessler, if I consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock.
And what, Sergeant?
We'll find him, not to worry.
You here again? What do you want?
I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.
The detectives got Matt up there in Sampson's office.
Here's twenty-five thousand.
Where do you think I've been?  I took the baby for a stroll in the park.
Yeah.
Not yet, Mr. Clark.
Dickson doesn't have to go. But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust—
I think, Mr. Dickson, we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning, if you don't mind.
You understand?
All right, Jack, all right.
I'm sorry, Dude, but—I—
Why, I needed a—
Yes, yes, it does. What are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
Don't you know I've been crazy about you for years?
What's the matter? Afraid papa will spank?
Now?
I'm listening.
That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.
Well, that's too bad. Mine's all right too.
It's amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you.
Happy now?
Last night? Er - why - uh, last night . . .
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Numbers? No, never mind.
Yes?
Ah, Mrs. Pembroke. I spoke to Mr. Schaffer at the Guaranty. He's going to take care of that mortgage for you . . .
Mr. Schaffer will take good care of you. He'll give you fifteen - maybe twenty . . .
I haven't any.
I don't know. Mr. Sampson bought it for me.
Sure, I think it's swell.
Aw, go on, forget it. You came through, didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot of them didn't think you would. You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me. It's been swell. Well, when are you and Helen going to get married?
I suppose you want me to fix that up for you too, eh?
Why wouldn't you tell me where you were last night?
Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there?
But I haven't . . .
I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson.
Yes, sir.
I hate to do this, but I've got to have time to dig up some help. I think I know where I can get some real cash. Snap into it, Sampson. We will lick this thing yet.
Come here, honey!
Oh, is that so?
A friend of mine - yeah, really - his mother was terribly sick and she was dying, would you believe it?
Oh, you think I'm lying?
All right, I'm lying. Don't forget you called me a liar.
Oh, Charlie again.
Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.
Are you sure?
He left here about an hour ago and went down to Dude Finlay's joint.
Yes, sir.
I don't know.
I guess so.
Tom, I'm this close to coming with you...
Sometimes a wound will kill.
That was two hours ago.
The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
Swear.
He's not bad at it.
I can hit those boys from here. We just need a distraction.
Best damn plan I heard all war.
Two.
Not yet. But I'm hoping.
Hey!
Yes. I am obviously not standing out in people's minds at the robberies.
Tell me.
You, ya barrel of pork lard. Here piggy piggy!
I could use the walk.
It's better. It's a construction depot. They'll have the strongbox and some ammo and explosives for us to take. That way we can take on a bigger job.
What will be?
I've robbed just as many banks as you have! I know this town, and I know this bank, and I say it's an easy job.
Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea --
I got us through the War all right.
I'm out.
Shakespeare.  He's European.
Get buckets!
Strategically.
They gonna rush us?
The District Marshall
You're right, sir.
What is it?
Died a hero.
Go home, Doc.  They ain't gonna hang no more Liberty boys.
I think he's already feeling better.
I'm upset too, Zee, but Jesse and Cole know what they're doing. I'm sure they won't press their luck.
I figure.
I reckoned.
Maybe, maybe...
What worries me is that Jesus is talking back.
Ma.
Make a thousand of 'em. Still won't be enough by the time I'm through.
Oh yeah.
See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.
I've been on my back two weeks. I'm sick of it.
What?
You didn't want to farm?
Thank God you grew out of that.  You did grow out of that, didn't you?
And what's this right girl like?
Frank and me have to go away for a while.
"Blazing Guns of the West. True Stories of Jesse James." Only a dime in the hotel lobby.
I'll explain on the way.
I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much.
Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it.
Ahh, you'll miss me.
Thanks.
I could have lied I suppose, but I want this marriage to be legal. I just want you to know, I'm trying to start a new life here. I'm depending on your...
Two weeks ago, we managed to arrange to have the Army hang one of the local farmers.
Yes sir.
What is going on here, man?
I look forward to seeing it.
What, sir?
Not such a menace now, is he, Pinkerton?
In English, Pinkerton.
Pumpkin?
Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.
You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you out of this slump.
Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up.
Yes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate him.
Is it a what?
Take it off.
Yes?
I don't want to talk about it.
Everybody's rich.
But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work.  You have a little something on your upper lip.
I'm just leaving.
Good coloring.
Nice.
How did you guess?
Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? "What about fucking dinner?"
No, he doesn't.
You saw the ad in the Times?
But I think...I want to know what happened here.
Yes, naturally.
But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore.
Uh huh.
Where are you going?
It looks that way, doesn't it?
Like what?
New card. What do you think?
No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm disappearing.
I'm just a happy camper. Rockin' and a-rollin'. VAN PATTEN  Rehab's done wonders for you, pal. Working for UNICEF now?
Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps?
When?
Oh no. I have no plans.
Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?
Who's Ted Bundy?
Sorry. 
Hmmmm.
Jean? Hello? Jean?
Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?
Well, most guys I know who work in mergers and acquisitions don't really like it.
Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the time.
Paul Owen.
No.
No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment.  Was that anything important?
Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.
No. I'm okay.
Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-
It's no problem
Shoot.
I know. I'm sorry.
No, I guess it's okay.
I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, you know.
What do you mean...Yale thing?
I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
Hang...out?
I just wanted to know if you know. BATEMAN Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's... Listen, I just...I just want to help.
We were both seven in 1969.
Well, maybe he did, huh?
What?
No.
No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.
Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.
Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You know.
That's not the information I've received.
Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?
Great, yes, I'd like that.
But how? Where do you place Paul that night?
But Marcus denied it?
Well, does Marcus have an alibi?
Why? Were you drinking? Is that why you lost it? Insider trading? Just joking. No, really-were you drinking on the job?
Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?
You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.
You know what he's like. He just wants to work on stuff that's cool.
I think that's great, Milo. I do.
I don't know! I just know it was Teddy's code. All these ideas flying in from everywhere. You know how he says "Any kid working in his garage can put us out of business?" It's like they know what every kid's doing.
Milo. Why would he --
Okay, yeah. I did something naughty... There's this amazing Comix store in Seattle.  To tell you the truth, I did it once or twice at Stanford. 'Guess I can't keep anything from you...
He has thousands of employees, Milo --
I know you. You're gonna run back to work right after dinner. I want my kiss now.
Don't we have any chopsticks?
You're just afraid to eat it.
'Thought if I relocated it could help my case. I'm writing programs for the local public access station. Where any whack-job with 100 bucks gets his own show? God, does it suck.  Can you help me?
You can't pre-empt Yoga, that's our biggest show.
He's working backwards, too.  Let's do number five?
Isn't there a stigma? Bankrolling this guy?
We tried!
It needs a more object-oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it?
...Do I?
Don't spend too much time searching. You ever vetted somebody's old code before?  It's a different skill. Stay close to the surface. The best-hidden secrets are in plain sight. You know the best place to hide a leaf, right?  In a tree.
Well -- you sent for me.
Were the flags for Teddy?
You look a little tired.
I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
'Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac.
Nothing does. Still. I want him to like me.
You do?
Got out of my other commitment.
...Something like that. Yeah.
No. Please.
"There is no second place." Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?
But they'd still get the idea, right?
It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.
Before they kill somebody else, too.
Gary.
Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.
Tell me you're not calling on your car phone?!
Jesus, Teddy.
I met this girl.
What d'you mean?
Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem?
Speaking of which...
Damn. 'Have to go back over there.  Be so much easier if we could walk in the front door.
Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. Right by the civil defense sign? Some geek's idea of irony. I been saying we need a camera in this hall.
Where is he?
Wait a second. I'm the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place.
Groovy.
Mmmm... I feel extreme relaxation.
Kiss me.
Is it about my teeth?
Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon?
Good luck, Austin.
Oh, and Austin...
The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.
You might also experience a slight fever, dry mouth, and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation. Austin, this is Commander Gilmour, Strategic Command, and General Borschevsky, Russian Intelligence.
Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.
Oh, and Austin...
Yes, Basil?
Thanks.
Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin.
I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...
Excuse me?
I'm sorry?
I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.
I'm sure.
Here, use mine.
No worries, luv. We'll just give Basil a tinkle on the telling bone...
Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.
You know who.
I'm looking at you, and the whole time I can't help thinking you had your willie inside her hootchie-kooch.
No, no, no. We'll use the floss to get to the ledge.
Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.
That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa.
Behave!
I don't even know what this is. This sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.
What are you saying, son?
Can't you see I'm only half a man? Look at me, I'm a freak!
Let this be a reminder to you all that this organization will not tolerate failure.
Right. Okay. Moving on.
It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.
Sea bass.
They're mutated sea bass.
No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.
Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.
Show me.
All right then...  ...FIVE MILLION DOLLARS!
Great.
You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
Of course not. I was married to your father.
OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.
... preserve...
... love ...
So I'm still ...
Ah, but you haven't see the real me. Watch closely ...
Have we met?
Really -- what happened in 1922?
The death of Peter Peel was a great loss. To us all ...
You killed my husband.
'Our revels now are ended.'
I'm already married ...
Valentine, listen to me ...
One very small thing. A diamond 'cyclone' chip. A thousand times more information on a fraction of the size. If I possess that, my powers would be unlimited. My dear half-brother was developing it. But he suspected sabotage. He gave the chip to ... you, 'Mrs.' Peel. I want you. But also your ring.
How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter.
And you must be Steed. Please don't get up.
And just what is the game?
A kipper. Or a red herring? What were they investigating?
Ahh. Perfect fit. The luxury of a hand-made shoe. As unique as a face or a fingerprint. Or should I say DNA?
As per mother's instructions.
You should be dead.  How do you feel?
Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs. Peel.
Did you say formal? I must dress.
Any ideas?
Is that written in his shoe?
She had this in her mouth. There, there...
... And by you, Mrs. Peel. Everything points to you.  No sisters?  No undiscovered twin?
I expect we'll have to gatecrash.
I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...
Nothing personal.
I thought you didn't.
You lied.
No idea who. No idea why ...
I'll catch you up. Don't worry; he's expecting you.
You first.
Decontamination -- ?
I know all this.
Who's now vanished.
Are you suggesting that Dr. Darling and Valentine were somehow in this together? But that's absurd.
Getting to what?
I shall need a small plane.
So you say ...
We want Mrs. Peel.
Brenda and I thought we'd drop in.
You didn't come to talk about the weather, surely.
She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill.
Too late anyway. Today's escapade was only for starters. This is no ordinary weather. It's manmade. A kind of weather bomb.
Where?
I'm warning you for the last time, Steed: whoever's behind all this, looks like Mrs. Peel, walks like Mrs. Peel and kills like Mrs. Peel.
I think so, thank you so much ...
I feel sure of it.
Valentine Peel. I see you've gone back to using your original face.
That's not playing by the rules.
You are, and it's behind you.
Check out the other guy's buns.
Nah. Everything's cool... I took care of 'em. 
Right in here. The big show starts in one minute.
You're kidding.
Chulo, one thing at a time.
Five thousand dollars.
The best.
The car for Debbie?
She's mine!
Yes I did.
Not at all. We're just finishing lunch.
Yes, sir, I am.
Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas.
Are you going to have women at your party?
Now, I want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland.
C'mon, I knew it was you.
Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick.
Look, you heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor party.
Look, girls -- I'll stay behind and hold them off. The rest of you break for it!
I know what I'm doing... Go!
I think I screwed that one once.
Let's see your bread.
What are you...
Why?
That's more like it.
Gary, you're quite an animal.
Isn't he incredible, gets along with everybody.
Let's have a toast.
This place should have been wall to wall tits by now.
Milt?
Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.
What do you mean, it changes?
All right. Now, there's milk and cookies in the refrigerator. Go to bed right after "Falcon Crest."
I'm trying to slash my wrists.
I couldn't find any razor blades.
Of course, sir. That explains it. Leather is a very good source of vitamin E.
No. Let's at least finish the set.
Hey, I'm starved... Let's go get something to eat. We'll bring back food for everybody.
C'mon. I insist.
My gift to you.
Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister.
Still drawing a blank.
Very.
You got it.
You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that.
Right. Give me the will to live. Let me go first.
Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect?
Great.  I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
You're absolutely right. I should never have stopped to save that drowning infant. I'm just weak, Sister; I'm so weak.
Be gentle.
No.  I need a drink.
-- You can't let him turn you against your friends, man --
I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother "you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed" games?
-- C'mon, Stephen.
C'mon, let's crawl home.
You got a problem with drilling, probie?
Just... Just wanted to say hello...
I really should get back. There's... there's something I'm supposed to do.
Everybody did.
I knew when you came looking for the chemicals. Looking for me.
We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.
Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low profile... the academy... I graduated today.
Hey, sorry if I made you look bad in front of your boss. But I'm not gonna be a poster boy for him, I'm trying to do something here. There's five hundred smoke eaters in this room that do that stuff for real every day. Tell Swayzak to talk to one of them.
Straightest answer your department's given me all week.
How's it going?
Yeah? Well, maybe I can fit it in...
Got anything to drink in there?
You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.
Yeah? And just how much of all this has been "doing your job"?
-- I work for the city.
Hi.
Your boss is lying, Jennifer.
Look, everybody remembers your old man. Being his son, all you had to do was breathe to graduate here. Dead Hero Father Rule. But you blew us off. Why should I take you back?
"Trychtichlorate is a binary structured --"
"During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher, Trych breaks down and dissipates. Will consume magnesium".
Trychticholorate. Then Swayzak can announce Seagrave was a murder.
Who all ended up wearing candles for faces...  Swayzak's up to his ass in this somehow. Guy can barely hold a drink in his hand, he's so scared.
Yeah.
No.
Four months.
-- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command.
Brian. He's not doing it right, dad. He never does it right.
And DIE!
Hey, what's with the mouth? Where'd you grow up, a barn?
You've come along a dozen times, Stephen, give your brother a chance. We'll be back in a few minutes.  How 'bout it, sport?
I'll be there, goddamn it!
Here we go...
Coffee? Nah, I gotta go.
He's out.
Y'know, I treated him better than any other probie I ever had. He probably hates my guts, but I did the best thing for him. I made him finally look in the mirror.
Stephen... I... can I talk to you a second...
Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago.
I know you.
Are the glory boys actually showing interest in Investigation's work? I may have a stroke.
Just catch the son of a bitch.
This'll only take a minute. There's two cops outside that want to ask you about this --
OK. OK. Fine. But -- do you believe in God?
"The Strawberries"?
Fuck you.  Just give me back a little something for the road.
Very good. Very good. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
Why do I dream every night of the whore who brought you water on your road to death? And why have I never forgotten that if she, then I --
Yeah, really. I'm no fucking asshole, man. I'm a fucking cop!
Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime. Lots of leads. You bet.
You've really got a problem.
You knew them?  Who were they, Sister? Who are these boys? What are the names of these -- good boys you knew?
I didn't mean to scare you like that.
So are you telling me that you wouldn't even introduce me to Delacroix or set up a meeting?  I'm talking 'bout me, your only brother, ya own flesh and blood, hook a brother up, youknowwhatI'msayin'.
What do I do?
Ladies and gentlemen, there is no need to go there.  We can all agree to disagree without making threats.
Naw, just jokin'.  That's you. That's you.
Sloan never told us she had friends like you.
Damn skippy.
Y'know what I mean.  Got a gig yet for Manray and I yet?
You'll both get an advance and you can stay with me.
Did we get our bill yet?
Trust me.  Of course I still have to pitch it to my boss, but we'll have an answer one way or the other.
To what?
Mantan?  I don't even care as long as I'm dancing.  Which reminds me, I need some new kicks.
Why?
Mantan!!
Don't you people get it?  We're in the 21st Century.  Slavery was over four hundred years ago.  All that stuff people talked in the old days, it's over.  Folks always crying, white man this, white man that.  Let's all grow up.
I'm sorry I'm late.
So let's take this great form, this very American tradition of entertainment into the 21st century, into the new millennium.
Exactly!
This could be bigger than "Amos and Andy."
Let'em try.  I will kill to make this happen.
If Spielburg can direct "The Color Purple" and "Amistad", our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot.
The big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier.  From the gitgo, from jump street.
I want to speak with you.
The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.
What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?
Do you know how you will use him?
It was the principle.  Dunwitty had to be enlightened.  I was making a point.  I take pride in my work. Plus, I already told you I wasn't gonna walk away from my money.
Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready.
Please don't go there.
Light?
DeLa, kiss my big black ass.
I don't believe it.
It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
Yes I have, very hard.  Has Daddy called?
Not at all?
You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?
My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
Thank you very much.  I always try my best.
Tavis, thank you for having me.
Our Alabamy Home.  Now we're getting countrified.  We is Bama's.
Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.
The one with da big...
Sleep 'N Eat, one of dem slinky, sexy, little foxy...
...no, she didn't...
You slept too near where you got in?
Mantan, it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut?
Are you trying to rap to me?
Gots no intention of ending up broke.
My people love me.
Y'know what?
Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa?
Why don't you answer?
The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.
It was my joke.  I was tired, and did not care to go farther.  There's not prettier woman here than that. If she won't suit your fancy, my friend, then you must wait awhile.
It's a lie!  You're a deserter! You're an impostor, sir; Your lies and folly have confirmed this to me. You pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know.  Will you join and take the bounty, sir, or will you be given up?
And his baggage?
The man that marries Dorothy Dugan must first kill me -- do you mind that?
Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You are no match for Best with the sword.
I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother?  She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin.
The coward!
Which O'Higgins do you know?  For I have never heard your name mentioned in my family.
Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body.
Your Grace, if I am so tame as to take this, then I must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation.
As you please.
Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.
Only the agency of servants.
I'd give five years of my life to see the old country again, the greenfields, and the river, and the old round tower, and the burying place.
I have faced that problem before.
Sir, we have but eighty thousand florins in bank, or two hundred thousand at three months; if your highness' bags do not contain more than eight thousand, we will meet you.
Certain?
Certainly, monseigneur, does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love?
On the instant.  Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you.
That is a trifle strong.
How can I believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you?
It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love.
I agree; but God put us on earth to take that risk.
I believe you, and I see I must hasten to leave, for otherwise I shall become the unhappiest of men.
Then I will respectfully take leave of her.
Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.
Agreed.
All right, five hundred guineas.
Oh, I am grateful to you, sir.  I am the wife of Captain O'Reilly hastening to join him at Dublin.  My chair was stopped by a highwayman; this great oaf of a servant-man fell down on his knees, armed as he was, and though there were thirty people in the next field, working, when the ruffian attacked, not one of them would help but, on the contrary, wished him "good luck."
O'Higgins... Mohawk O'Higgins.
That's very kind of you, Mr. O'Higgins.
You must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in Dublin, where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound. I hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house, where Captain O'Reilly will welcome with delight, my gallant young preserver.
Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed.
Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?
Hang it, Mr. Roderick James, you have no more manners than a barber, and I think my black footman has been better educated than you; but you are a young fellow of originality and pluck, and I like you, sir.  because you seem determined to go to the devil by a way of your own.
Come, come, sir.  I am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool.
Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for me, as I am drawing near the goal, to find my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me, that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor?  Isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife, getting everything ready for her husband's departure?
Black-eyed Sczortarska.
Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight?
It's ten thirty in the morning.
You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license.
Yeah, and I could've used the sleep. I'm supposed to meet people here tonight, try and get some work going.
I thought I was gonna have an attack. Go into a fit and bite off my own tongue in the middle of the bayou. Childs could tell I wasn't right.
Maybe he's dead too. Maybe you killed them both, Mueller --
We don't know. West is dead.
What do you mean, alone?
We found him like this...
I'm serious --
I didn't shoot West --
Mr. Hardy, I joined the army for college money. I didn't ask for any of this -- I tried to do the right thing out there and people got killed. You say finding those bodies'll help me, then go find them. I don't want to die.
You wanna bet?
Do what?
Sir, yes, sir!
So did we. Why didn't you come?
We just want to check your pack --
That's exactly what he says about you.
Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
Just look. Little pocket.
You saw West, right? How was he killed?
No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s --
Put it down!
But not the only victim, right?
I didn't kill him --
Stop.
Because of what I saw.  Who really killed West.
Well, he's a good soldier.
The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.
He can wait. Kendall's out of surgery.
That's horseshit and you know it.
I thought you said that wasn't a compliment.
That's preposterous --
I'm not even going to dignify that --
Kendall Junior is still in surgery, so he won't be available to answer for his name or anything else for another hour -- the cadet we're talking to first is Dunbar.
Excuse me?
Microrecorder for Kendall -- didn't have time to wire his room. Now tell me why you joined the army or I'll jab this pen through your neck.
I lost a bet.
So noted.
Have no fear, Osborne, we have not yet begun to fight.
Well, I'm sure if he'd known this was all going to happen he'd have tried harder to witness it for you --
Because it's my job. Because people are dead. Because of the whole honor and duty thing, make a difference in the world, crap like that.  We can do this, Hardy.
Exactly, someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned. You only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe, so when the time comes, they've totally bought into your version of events.
What Kendall said -- "the type of guys you don't feel comfortable going to sleep around." That's what Dunbar said about Childs to the letter.
Positive. Hardy, they planned this.
Nah.
Right back where we started.
Seven guys. What was it you said? You were "just starting to believe I wasn't the guy people said".
Yeah. I can wait till you're off the base and do it myself.
Yeah. But he was a lot of other things, too. Thanks.
Mueller. He's as bad as West and we both know it. Now I can't do it, cause I'm tied up, but we get the others to go along --
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
Poor fucker my ass...
Like I said, I was in the kitchen. When I came out, Mueller and Pike were dead, Nunez and Childs were hit and Dunbar was gone.
I scared Dunbar into silence. He's been trying to cover for me the whole time. We got here, you came to see me... I didn't know if I could trust him with that kind of secret --
Bullshit --
The army kicked you out for drugs...
It was on that night Karl met his destiny. And I met mine. Almost.
Sorry, kid. I don't do charity.
Yes.
I don't expect to.
I brought it.
Absolutely. Be good for you to talk to him.
Thirty years. Maybe more.
It's not a woman, it's a fish. No one ever catches her.
How did you know?
Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.
Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If nothing is going to change, I'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time.
Lucky girl.
Stop.
Please?
I like your stories.
I love every square inch of it. But I can feel the edges closing in on me. A man's life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this.  So what do you say? Join me?
Make him stop.
Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?
No Dad, they don't. I do not like the story. Not anymore, not after a thousand times. I know all the punchlines, Dad. I can tell them as well as you can.  For one night, one night in your entire life, the universe does not revolve around Edward Bloom. It revolves around me and my wife. How can you not understand that?
You think I'm up for it?
Okay.
Can we talk?
What?
You think I'm fake.
Like this.
Yes. Exactly.
Don't need to apologize to me. I mean, I'm the luckiest person you're going to find today...
But you're wrong. I do know you, at least by reputation. Edward Bloom from Ashton. See, I'm actually engaged to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He was a few years older than you.
I called everywhere in five states and explained this was the only way I could get my wife to marry me.
I was astonished to see the greatest poet of both Ashton and Spectre all the way out in Texas.
Because he's dying.
No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.
Yes.
I'll help you.
Probably tonight.
They met at Auburn.
That's because most of it never happened.
Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy.
You're not.
I am always on your side. And I think you should talk to him.
We rented a car.
You don't talk about those things. Not yet.
Really! That's wonderful.
Of course.
Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume things you don't know.
He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.
Yes?
We'll stop then.
Right. So I can say he smokes me. So.
I asked her if you were happy to see us. I find it hard to tell with you.
What?
"I have these uh..." She explains to you... "When I was a little girl my father had these beautiful old glasses." Like... I don't know the word. Like for watching uh... for watching the birds.
Binoculars. He had these Binoculars he has kept from the war.
He says why did you send to Russia for a wife.
You can stay tonight.
John.
What? What does he want?
He wants money.
I've got eight hundred pounds. Oh Jesus.
I'm so sorry.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
It makes it faster. If I don't speak to the men, they fall faster. It's pretty obvious why.
Have you got your passport?
I don't want to talk about him.
Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money.
So. What then? You just detach sex from everything..
Listen. I didn't go rooting around in your private stuff.
Sometimes.
So what did you want? I think we understand each other, no?
Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.
Thank Christ for that.
No.
Laugh it up.
Except for Small Eyes.
Whatever.
I'm sorry.
It's not mine either.
I'm not asking you to marry me.
It's more like a date.
Maybe you will find out.
Just wanted to see.
Go on, Laz. You can talk to me.
Well that's good. I'm happy to hear it.
That'd be nice.
Come on, just a little somethin'. Right here. Go'on now, don't be shy.
Why you stop havin' dancin' on Saturday? Used to have bands... all kind's live shit. Like a wake up in here, now.
Yeah. Transmission's shot.
They been keepin' a folder on me cuz of my stomach. Like how it was just before we'd play ball back in school. Thought it was just some tic I got, or ulcers like my daddy had.  I can't... shoot. Target practice I'm a pro. I tag between the numbers each time but...  But when there's really loud noises around me... somethin' happens. I get shaky and... I lose my breath. They called it anxiety. Severe anxiety. It can be fixed and all... just not in time for....  It's a long process but... they sent me home.
She's around. Always is.
She ever tell you she was thinkin' of taking off?
You think I'm Ronnie's spy or somethin'? Come tomorrow that dumb- ass gonna be halfway round the world tryin' to keep his head on his shoulders. You think he's gonna be thinkin' about you?
Your mother's funeral. I's a pallbearer, remember?
LAZ, I said let...!
Boy? You here to make a point, or you here to kill somebody?
You sayin' you'll do what?
Test. Shit. What kind'a test you thinkin'? You mean like, if you a man or not? If you a killer? Only one way to prove that. You just look me in the eye, boy, and you squeeze that trigger back.
Son, I'm grown. Don't got patience to suffer you children and this monkey junk. I'm too old to play house...  ...and cowboys. So let's have it. End me or get out of my face!
GAL! YOU HEARIN' MY VOICE?
Come on, gal...
The fuck you been doin' to me?
Well I'm woke now... you can take this off.
I CAN'T!
I know. I get it. What's Matthew doin'?
Let go of me...
Sure.
The... chain helps.
No one's gonna hurt you no more.
Right here. Be here all afternoon.  You ready for this?
Nothin'.
I've had nice things before but I always ruined 'em somehow.
Huh?
She like it rough? You like beatin' on her?
Now, hold up.
Naw!
I never laid a hand on her in anger. Not a day. Not even when I's drinkin'. But this business got me wonderin' what a good shake and slap would do for her.
I didn't start this, R.L.
You gonna preach 'bout turnin' the other cheek?
This ain't got nothin' to do with that woman. Just don't want nobody around me now.
Ain't gonna be moved?
One thing at a time, Laz.
She's tied to me, R.L.. We tied to each other.
We ain't here to talk about that shit.
That's right.
Rae, look at Ronnie. And tell him how you feel.
Hey.
Yeah, I know.
Yeah?
Are you wasted?
All them people shoutin' your name like they were doing tonight! Shit! That arm you got'll get'chu on a box of cereal...
Ronnie. Please, baby...
Ronnie...
You need money again?
You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me.
I'm workin' here, Rae. Can you see that?
Thought you had a man for that.
Let go...
No.
I didn't know.
Nick, we can't just --
I hope not.
Sure, a rice burning crotch rocket...
Where would you look for the mafia?
The mayor's office, under the bed, the back room at Lombardi's.  And call me Ich.
That's what you said in the last three piss pots.
Give us a break...
Four goddamn days.  This is going nowhere...
Ichiro --
Gaiijin.
He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.
I can't...
Now we've got nothing to negotiate with.
Me too.
He's on duty.
Where's Ich?
You could fake it.
He drinks.
Yeah.
I planned on catching him, Captain.
He killed a police officer.
If anything happens to her while I'm here --
I'm impressed.  But let's use the short form.  I'm looking for --
The Feds would be onto you in a month.
You certainly have a nice place here.
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Can the maker repair what he makes?
Had in mind something a little more radical.
Come here.
Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed DNA strand carries a mutation and you're got a virus again... but all this is academic -- you are made as good as we could make you.
Like what?
Hello, glad to meet you.
Okay, but don't kill him.  Save a little for everybody.  A masterpiece.
Five.  Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation.  Killed two guards and got as far as the Genetic Sector before he got fried going through an electro- field.
Then let her get away.  I thought you were a pro -- you're supposed to be a fuckin' tracker!
Yeah.
The five in question are third generation Nexus Sixes, constructed of skin-flesh culture, selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of self-perpetuating thought, para-physical abilities and developed for emigration program.  Are you with me?
I know all that.
Nexus designated Zhora:  incept June 13th 2017, athletic conditioning, highly competitive, special abilities in the entertainment field.
Shot of vodka, please.
I like you too.
Four years.
Nope.
Lots of places.  The tours, the clubs, the Silicone shows, private parties.
Like to get this position.  Did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person?
Of course he's not real.  You think I'd be working here if I could afford a real snake?
Sorry.
Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?
I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help.
What do you want me to do?
Me and my dad.
Not too good.
If they are smart, they take naps.
Never mind the plug, just go through the motions.
Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
What?
Black?
Nothing is infallible, but so far the Voight-Kampff scale bas been foolproof.
Sorry.
Don't move.
Of course.
I never seen a turtle.
Hi.
What's that?
I keep a lot of provisions right here.
You like it?
Thank-Q!
Come where?
Yes, ma'am.
Shallow? I'm shallow?!
We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.
You're lost?
You don't?
So what?!  I've got two of him!  And this many DiMaggios and Robinsons. I was holding these out, too.
Yes.
Perry?
Okay, okay!  Take it easy!
Oh, I could die...
Yeah! Listen to this part. This is where it really takes off!
No.
Why does it never work out?  You and...men?
Doing what?
How long would you need me?
No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.
And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh...
Name it.
Why?!
You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!
Sure.
You said it would be easy!
What?!
Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!
Good for you.
Sure.
Wazoo!  Try to listen.  Whataya think? Surfer, grunge, hip- hop, Euro trash?
Yeah.
Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"
Well...yeah. Okay.
Not that one!
And don't be so obvious!
Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of putting it.
Maybe. But that's how it works.
Goodnight!
Thanks.
Sing it to me.
No.
Not at all.  And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first.
My mother's like that.
What?
Of course you do.  I'll stay here and pray.
It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
Shit is a French word?
And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why.
Russia.
Sorry, that's the largest city.
Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go eat!
Yeah?
A magazine?  A toy perhaps?  In the bookstore.
Of what?
I guess living up here makes people look older.
The sky!!!
I was thinking of selling all the cards.
Hey, smart ass, how 'bout I kick your butt?
I'll go up.
The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. She'd bring him sandwiches and hot Dr. Pepper.
"Hell up here?"  Honey, it's been hell up here, down there and over yonder! Hell everywhere.
Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.
To keep us from trying to leave. After an atomic blast there's a radiation half-life that lasts thirty five years.
No, Calvin, you're favorite.
I told you! I've got everything!
Honey?
No, Calvin.  Babies cry.
Right here!
Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!
Would you excuse me?
No.
I don't believe it!
Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?
We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then--
Well, I am the head of this household--
--and we will--
--do as I say!
I thought ten years.
Shana Gillroy's apartment.  Remember her?  The model who went to Harvard? Well, I better get going!  Bye, Adam. Nice coat!
Out-of-town.  That's all he'll say.
Well, that's blunt!
I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
He's from Alaska.
Always good advice.
Eve?!
It's not so much what you say but how you say it.  Women like men who are unpredictable.
Right here?  Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't sure!
From the oddest place. His parent's told him. I don't think I got that memo.
He didn't leave with them.
He left with Sophie.
Coward!
I know...I know. You did the right thing.
Oh.  Well, you're...certainly welcome!
Have him committed.
He was always so "nice"! How was I supposed to know that's a good thing?! "Nice" is weird! Nice is...what is "nice"? It's not cool! I'll tell you that.  Was it ever?
What?!
Where?!
No, I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.
Certainly Frank.  Darling, get some glasses. We'll have some beer with Frank. Won't you sit down?
Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.
Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
It must be great.
The criminals are winning.
Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
It's blue. Blue velvet.
Yes sir.
Jeffrey.
I wanted to see you.
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
I saw you come in, talk on the phone. Get undressed.
Well.
Then you got undressed.
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
See my nipples?
You can kiss them if you want. Feel them. They're getting hard.
What?
Did I say that? I didn't mean it, or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
I, uh.
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
Hello.
I'm sorry, maybe I better go Dorothy.
Sure I do.
Yes.
Kiss me.
Just get outta my bed.
No, it's not Don.
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell, it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
It's okay. It's okay.
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
Alright, suit yourself.
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
Oh he forced you, huh?
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. To make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue, blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
A ride? Hell, that's a good idea. Okay, let's go. Hey, let's go.
FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!
Here's to Ben.
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
There ya go.
Be right down.
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
Jeffrey! Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store, maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so.
You can't just stay out half the night and carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late.
No. No thank you.
Yeah. okay.
I'll get a coat for her.
Yes.
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others.
Yeah. It's close by, that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case.
Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute.
I'm here, aren't I?
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
Alright.
Yeah.
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
Why not?
It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
He got a little jealous.
OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. This is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. They have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. The ears were for her a warning to stay alive. There is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". You saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
I don't see how I can, and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. Also it could get you in trouble.
Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world?
Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.
Dorothy Vallens?
Okay. Let's get her over to your father's.
Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.
You can change it if you want to.
Sure, just a sec.  Excuse me.
Well he's the one shooting up all his guys, right? He's scared of the kid. Says he's real good, got every available gun in the city up there.
Mother Mary, full of grace.
Well, not armed. If they had guns, they'd have used them. But dangerous? Oh yeah.
You're not being charged. It's up to you. Do you want to talk to them?
Weird, huh?... Know what I think is weird? Decent men with loving families go home every day after work. They turn on the news and see rapists, murderers, and child molesters all getting out of prison.
Well... what if your boss knew how many guys were supposed to be there... in that room?
Fuck, man! I may as well have posted flyers. Right out in public, man.
MEEE! ME! I'm the guy! I know everyone, their habits, where they hang out, who they talk to. I know where they fuckin' live. We could kill everyone!
No way. I've been waitin' for this asshole.
Fuck you! I told you I never saw him before!
Okay, just calm down. He could hurt us, brother. He could ruin the whole thing.
Is that worthless brother of your there? I want you both ta hear this.
What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!
Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out first?
I'll see what I can do. How do I get in touch with you?
He got beat up by a girl.
Yeah. It's been twenty-seven years.
"We just got up and left. Bum musta rolled them before the police got there."
Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing we're gonna need it for.
A bit.
We'll find it. Just calm down.
Aye.
I'm strangely comfortable with it.
Rocco, this is the real deal. We must kill without hesitation, without guilt or remorse. Evil man, dead man.
And we will send you to whatever God you wish.
Okay then... let's get ya started.
Rule of thumb?
Oh, come on now Rozengurtle. I was just tryin' ta get a rise outta ya.
Now look Rozengurtle, we're sorry. Just relax.
Uh... two shooters!
That's just fucking weird. I have no idea.
You... oh god, why?
Yeah. Some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead, or silver.
What about one guy with two guns?
Eight.
Oh that's just BEAUTIFUL! All the scumbags in the quiet city of Boston start dropping dead and you think it's unrelated?! Greenly, the day I want the Boston Police doing my thinking for me, I will have a fucking tag on my toe! Now, get me a squad car and get me over there. I want the crime scene photos and any witness statements. NOW!
I...
Okay, seriously, both you listen ta me now.
We promise.
Who says that? You could take credit on it.
This is some crazy shit, man!
You sure you killed them?
Well, I'm sold.
Y-Yes my son.
Why have I come to a church? I never have before. I guess I just... felt I should.
You have entered the house of the Lord of your own free will speaking of beliefs and feelings. Is it so much to believe that God has brought you here?
Then you must find out what your beliefs are.
Do you think they would harm an innocent man, for any reason?
God have mercy on my soul.
How long since your last confession, my son?
Joey Bevo said it was important. Said I had to give it to him myself.
He says. This is he.
I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.
Yeah, I saw it.
Dignan, it's got an alarm.
Yeah, I heard that.
Eight dollars.
You're out! I'm not working with either one of you!
Like he would find Dignan. One day.
Because my mom gets the bill.
Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.
I know. But once you get inside you're home free.
Then you're going to have to dye it, Anthony. We've got to hide our identities. Especially after Bob crashed the car.
Hi.
Sure.
No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't speak English.
No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.
Yes... It's true.
You don't know how to hotwire.
Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
I know.
She needed it.
What is it?
Easy, Dignan. It's OK.
It's going back down.
I'll see you there.
I'll see you there.
I don't think so.
Yeah.
What can I say? It's jail. You don't sleep when you want to. You don't eat when you want to.
What?
Thanks.
Technique. That's right. Seventy- five percent of your job is crowd control. Seventy-five percent. Do you believe that?
Yeah. Convert it into lofts. OK. Pop quiz. What's the single most important aspect of your job?
What do you mean what kind of person? He's a good person.
I don't think you're giving him enough credit. I know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through. He gets too excited. But --
Hold it.
What do you mean?
I don't want to die.
Death.
No. Bob did.
Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?
I hope not.
I don't know. I personally don't need that shit in my life right now.
OK, Dad.
He looked too shaken-up.
I don't know. I don't know anything. Except Phil says they got him. And he's in jail.
No, I don't mind.
Sixty days?
Why do you say that?
No. I wasn't adopted.
Jesus Christ! No.
It was stupid.
Cause you would of let my brother rot in jail.
No, I'm having a heart attack. Of course, I'm OK. What's that supposed to mean?
Sure.
Cuba.
You're Anthony?
The front stairs.
That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
Well, this isn't really a party per se.
Bob! Get back in position!
I thought your parents were in Italy.
Yes. I did.
Let's just go.
He electrocuted someone?
His name was Swifty?
Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural.
No. All he'll remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose.
I don't want to talk about it.
See you in a little while.
But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man?
I was just going to use it to see how much I had.
We'll have to see when we get back.
His name's not Future Man, Dignan.
Anthony. Bad news.
Look. We want you on the job.
He's having a heart attack or something.
What's that?
I don't really want to talk about it, Bob.
I'm trying.
26 weeks.
Did you hear that?
We're just going over a few things.
No. I just have short hair.
Sure.
Si. Tecate. You like to fight?
There was a mistake.
And the Landy woman?
Bourne comes here? Why?
Never heard of it.
He does. I've been down to the archives. I have the files, Ward.
Conklin might've been a nut, but he wasn't a mole. You have me his calendar for a couple of days, I'll prove he killed Lincoln.  This is supposed to be definitive?
And you do? From the moment he left Treadstone, he has killed and eluded every person that you sent to find him...
I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
And Danny Zorn, what was that?
And?
It was staged?
Okay... 
I speak English.
Then what?
YOU'RE A LIAR!
Is this really happening?
She wouldn't let me.  She's the only reason you're alive.
Conklin.
I don't know! Why would I lie?
I did.
-- take the back -- get another car --
But it ends up the same.
-- there's places -- we can't afford to be wrong!
Where are you going?
Tell me later.
It wouldn't have changed the way you feel.
IS SHE RUNNING TREADSTONE?
They know!  They know you were here. They know you killed these two guys. They know you and Conklin had something on the side. They don't know what it is, but they know!
What do you mean?
Ramstein Air Base, Germany.  Before the wall fell you would have woken up in a Russian prison hospital.
Careful...
Are you disappointed?
What's that?
Sounds like a threat.
Why you're alive?  You're alive because you're special. Because she kept you alive.  Because we want you back on our side.
And the Germans can't match it?
We're talking raw, unprocessed KGB files. It's not something we can go out and comparison shop.
I think that Bourne and Conklin were in business. That Bourne is still involved. And that whatever information I was going to buy in Berlin, it was big enough to make Bourne come out from wherever he's been hiding to kill again.  How's that scan?
You were his local contact. You were with him the night Conklin died. You're coming with us.
Am I a doctor, no, but...
It's got caffeine in it. That's all I know.
It is suicide.
My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes.
He strained his leg so that it pains him to ride. But he sends his greetings -- and says that I speak for all the Bruces. And for Scotland.
He was a modest man.
Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!
That is another matter. There is a price to all this, required both by Longshanks and our nobles. Pay it, and you will be our king. And we will have peace.
He will. I know he will.
Scotland. He intends --
Look at me. I said LOOK AT ME!
Hamish, I... thank...
We're here to stay. We don't care to live, if we can't fight beside ya.
With your father and brother gone, they'll kill us and burn the farm!
The test of a soldier is not in his arm. It's here.
We don't split up!
It matters not, he is thy king!
Thank you for inviting.
You are. And I'll come again.
You scare me.
My parents are growing suspicious! I can't keep meeting you every night!
...Tonight!
York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.
Because of the way you're looking at me now. The same way... as when we met.
I have taken vows. More than one. I've vowed faithfulness to my husband, and sworn to give him a son. And I cannot keep both promises.
Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.
We all end up dead. It's only a question of how. And why.
They've tricked us.
The dogs have a scent. My scent. Someone must have given it to them.
A journal. Just have him write down everything he does.
But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.
Um... can dad come this time?
Good. Because I've been waiting to see your art projects all week and I'd feel terrible if all you thought about was your father not being there.
Great. I'll see you soon.
I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.
Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.
Cute, Evan.
Weirder than this?
No, protecting her.
Lemme guess. Would that be where the memories are stored?
Photos?
What?
Sorry, dude. Just figured it'd be okay with you bein' sick and all.
You really don't remember anything that happened?
I've stopped a hundred times.
Me? Are you kidding? Why?
Mmmm... You give good compliment. Clean up and come back to bed.
I walk differently?
I get it. You can drop it now.
Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts?
Which is?
Why not? But that's not how things wound up. I'm with Lenny, Lenny's your friend. And there it ends.
Look, Jason, I need some fast answers if I'm ever gonna fix what I've done.
Bullshit. I'll send you a postcard when I've made everything perfect again.
Oh, fine I guess. It's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up, so I haven't...
I still owe you an essay from last week. Is there any way I could get an extension?
Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
Deal. Now read me something.
Forget it. What's the point of Psych now? Tomorrow I could wake up as some dirt farmer in Bangladesh.
It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.
I'll do whatever you want. You don't want me to ever see Kayleigh again, fine. Just let Crockett go. Besides, you kill him now and they'll stick you in juvy for sure. And I know you'd never leave your sister alone with your father.
I think I'll go check out the chapel.
I come from a big family.
You're such a retard!
What? No frigging way, man. I'm not touching that thing.
Ain't gonna work this time, buddy. Look how small that fuse is! I'll get killed.
Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.
Yes, but we have not much money, and traveling is so expensive and difficult. It was much more than we thought to get here. And then Captain Renault sees us and he is so kind. He wants to help us.
Yes, Monsieur.
-- Will he keep his word?
I'm sorry. It is.
Yes, Monsieur.
But we who are still free will do all we can. We are organized, Monsieur, underground like everywhere else. Tomorrow night there is a meeting at the Caverne du Bois. If you would come...
No thanks, Carl.
Goodnight, Monsieur Rick.
-- Tonight he forgot.
Yes, sir.
It shall not happen again, Monsieur.
It's not for sale.
I don't buy or sell human beings.
Well, you're in good company. Renault and Strasser probably think so, too.
I shall remember to pay it... to myself.
Yes. I put that dress away. When the Germans march out, I'll wear it again.
Why I'm so lucky. Why I should find you waiting for me to come along.
Uh huh.
I know very little about you, just the fact that you had your teeth straightened.
Yes, I guess it is a little too far ahead. Well, let's see. What about the engineer? Why can't he marry us on the train?
Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly I remember the last one. A wow finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face, because his insides had been kicked out.
Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one will come to you as you go along.
I don't think I will, Rick.
Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, I'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night.
You can believe that if you want to.
The stairs from the street.
Richard, I had to see you.
All except one. He won't have you.
All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.
Because you're getting on that plane.
Not tonight no more. He ain't coming. Uh, he went home.
Victor, I'm afraid for you.
I meant to, but something always held me up. I love you very much, Ilsa.
And as far away from Major Strasser as possible.
Victor, please, don't go to the underground meeting tonight.
Apparently he has the letters.
But no intention of selling them. One would think if sentiment wouldn't persuade him, money would.
I know how it is to be lonely.  Is there anything you wish to tell me?
Yes, I'm ready.  Goodbye, Rick. God bless you.
Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and Rick is --
Not at all.
Yes. I found that a very expensive hobby, too. But then I never was much of a businessman.
Keep it. You'll need it in America.
All except one thing. There's something you should know before you leave.
I'm going to anyway, because it may make a difference to you later on. You said you knew about Ilsa and me.
No. Two champagne cocktails, please.
This is a very interesting cafe. I congratulate you.
Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one to say it, but it's late.
We'll be there.
May we proceed with the business?
Thank you.
I was in a German concentration camp for a year. That's honor enough for a lifetime.
-- Thank you.
I should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on French soil.
Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.
Don't be in such a hurry. You have all the time in the world. You may be in Casablanca indefinitely... or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow, on one condition.
Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
By the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done?
Champagne and a tin of caviar.
Thank you.
You weren't always so carefully neutral. We have a complete dossier on you.
It may interest you to know that at this very moment he is on his way here.
My dear Major, we are trying to cooperate with your government, but we cannot regulate the feelings of our people.
But everybody's having such a good time.
Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.
I stick my neck out for nobody.
Perhaps not.
Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world.
-- Hello, Ilsa.
That was some going-over your men gave my place this afternoon. We just barely got cleaned up in time to open.
Put it down as a gesture to love.
I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!
Ricky, I'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo. If by any chance you were to help him escape --
What friend?
Serves me right for not being musical.
Have you taken leave of your senses?
Put that gun down.
I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later.
Sacha, she's had enough.
You will forgive my curiosity, Mr. Blaine. The point is, an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us.
Put that phone down!
Well, what makes you think I haven't?
No.
I like it fine here.
No.
She's coming back. I know she's coming back.
Shut up and go home, will you?
Stay calm, identify the problem. Problem, rope fraying.  Solution, fix rope.
You've had today's water.
Survive today, that's the point.
I'm putting it off.
Fix raft first.
No!
You quitter you quitter you quitter.
Thank you for fucking up my life.
They're on autopilot.
I'm serious.  I'm always going on about me, me, me.  Enough about me.  Your turn.
Nothing out there but ocean.
Shut up.  I don't feel like dying today.
No.
As much as anybody.
I had it on the island with me.
I thought I did.
Not if you work for FedEx.
You don't seem too happy about it.
For when I travel?
I guess I hadn't thought through how I felt.
A week, max.  Okay?  Okay?
Hey...hey...it's okay!
Maybe now's when you tell me about it.
Don't overwhelm me with the details.  You know how I hate that.
Not when you have no choice.
That's what I told the fish I caught. But I ate them anyway.
Your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability, depression, anxiety, periods of self-reproach.  It's almost like schizophrenia.  Different sides of your personality might come to life, speak out, act out.
I most definitely say I am.
Well, when that IV runs out, you're through with us.  Just the dentist tomorrow.
Let's eat.
I'm doing fine.
There's settled folks, and there's nomads.  You're just not a settled folk. You never belonged here.
The tide saved me, Mom.  I lived by it. I'm just wondering where it will take me next.
Kamal, you're breaking up.  Can you hear us?
What about the sender?
Borrowed.  I borrowed it.
Look, I'm sorry about your plane.  But I couldn't risk being late into Memphis.
I'm trying to help you here.  There's Warsaw, there's this --
Ninety five percent?  Just give me the money now.
Time I had lots of.
What's it all about?  It's about being so thirsty you'd crush a fish's backbone to suck out the spinal fluid -- that's what it's about.
Permission granted.
San Francisco.  And you?
It claims to restore monthly regularity.
It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether.
Better than I can!
I know.
She died of *secrecy*, she died of *ignorance*...
They'll believe it because they want to believe it.
He mentions Homer, too, you know.
I'm *never* bored! It's all very... different for me... here.
I don't think Mr. Rose would leave without you.
Yes. But it's closed all the time now, because of the blackout.
You think? Maybe I was.  I love this place!
I didn't say that. Growing up in an orphanage, you're always lonely. You're just never alone.
Nobody will swim here until next summer. By then, the water will have rubbed the glass smooth against the sand--there won't be any sharp edges.
Right.
I'm just waiting and seeing. Like you said.
Okay, okay--I know you do, too.
No. Nothing is nothing. I want Wally to come home. I'm afraid to see him, too.
I'm not trying to be anything--I'm just doing nothing! If I wait and see long enough, then--with any luck-- I won't *ever* have to make up my mind! Decisions can be painful, after all...
Please... that's enough. I *loved* you, too--you know I did.
You say that as though it's some awful thing!  I never stopped loving Wally!
No. You warned me. I didn't listen, but you warned me.
Yes, I *have*!
I can't go nowhere.
Well, *picking* them is! It's about as exciting as... walking!
I love you, too. See you tomorrow.
You mean somebody asked?
He's leaving...
Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?
Well, we can only guess about that, Edna. They *are* against the law.
He probably doesn't make much money picking apples--he must have had to pay to send them, too.
Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.
Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.
She looks after other people's children.
Why can't we have pumpkins for Christmas, too? We don't get any good presents at Christmas, anyway.
No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure.
Really! Is it serious?
The only jobs are picking jobs. Picking apples is truly boring.
Actually, I volunteered.
Okay...
I guess so...
And I *love* her! There ain't nobody else gonna treat her as good as I do!  I wouldn't do nothin' to hurt her, Homer--you must know that.
One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.
When it comes to this, you is the real thing--is that what you sayin'?
Where'd she get you?
One: it's illegal. Two: I didn't ask how to do it--you just showed me.
Obviously.
You do it then.
It's *your* splice! You blame me for everything!
It is. I'll get this. You go ahead.
Mrs. Worthington, I feel I'm very lucky to be here.
We heard that one already, Homer.
So what?
No trouble.
That's it.
Them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there!
Then I suppose we can look forward to catching various diseases from him!
They told Muddy his feet was too flat!
They ain't drops--I picked 'em off the tree!
That's right--that sounds like trouble to me.
You just stay out of trouble, Homer!
You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please...
That's right, Homer. This ain't your business.
She took off in the night!
He ain't never been outta Maine!
Oh god. I'm overbearing and rude. Lily. Lily Finn.
What do I do? I'm the VP of Finance.
You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you.
The standard ten.
Jake? Right. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Yeah, it's going through --
Isn't it always?
So you want to know how to play the Big Con.
After you cut her loose.
Mob?
So what? We just stay clear of him.
I just don't know if this says, "me". What's the fabric?
Tonight. Just me.
Yes, her. Where's my wallet?
She's up for it.
You sure?
What? No. Use the bathroom on the plane!
We got caught. So you know it won't happen again.
No thanks. I'm good.
Yeah Well, Sobo's kid needs braces.
Well he's in town and he sure as shit remembers you. What are we going to do about this Jake? We can't afford to have a Fed onto us.
Jake. Jake Pearson. I go to lawschool with your daughter. Carolyn. We met once or twice.
Help me.
Just play a part. A little acting.
I'll worry about Customs.
What?
You're just going to have to trust me.
Uh-huh.
What about this? Do you have any idea what this means? You've killed us. We're dead!
For what? A couple hundred bucks?
It's what I do. It's my job.
No. You have another part? You'll know what to do.
You want to talk about an old boyfriend right now?
You guys got busted. This is a great neck.
Lily... Jesus Christ...
Miles...
Wait a second... Who's the mope?
What?
Good point.
I'm sorry.
Let me ask you something... You really think I'm going to come this close, this fucking close and let my guard down? I'll get square with your boss. I'll get square with whoever did Al. I'll get square with everybody. Then I'm going going to cash in my chips and be on my way to a new and better me far away from here.
No offense, but I've seen you fight. You gotta be kidding m-
HE GOT CAUGHT! Your boss tried to pull a switch and he got us all fucking pinched!
Not easy pickin's. Papers like these speak to larger issues. Sorry about Alfonse.  You into something big?
I can handle it.
I got it figured out... He's got this thing with bathrooms. If he makes it through Customs, he'll be heading for the john.
Look, I'm not a confrontational person by nature.
That's it?
To who?
That's what I'm talking about.
High five.
Is it that bad?
No. Thanks.
All men are cheats.
Look, now I'm pumping you. I'm sorry. It's none of my business. It's just that you're not like the others.
I don't know anything about it.
How about five hundred.
How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty.
I want a job, Giles.
I'm working on that soccer story.
Not particularly.
You want me drunk?
I. sold the car.
Come on, Marion. Let's face the truth. Nobody's going to publish it.
450? What did you do, just walked in and said I want to be a croupier? Don't you need training?
Don't play the cop with me, Marion.
Do you have to swear all the time?
Haven't you got a conscience of your own?
I hope it brings you luck.
Gambling's about not facing reality. Ignoring the odds.
I thought you wouldn't want to spend Christmas Day alone in here.
You know where I'm from?
Well, thank you anyway.
There's a casino in this hotel.
So why did you come to my casino?
You're serious.
Reynolds? You've done your research.
Well, life's not fair. We know that.
It's a shame there aren't more men in the world like you.
Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.
Who...
You did?
Are you going to put a spell on me?
Too much. Eighteen hundred.
Over the river.
Thanks.
If I see you do it again, I'll report it.
That bitch? No.
Loosen up, Jack. If you don't, this job'll get to you. The pressure's too much, believe me, it'll break you.
Don't worry.
I was at Beadles.
Five.
We had the same rule at Sun City, but it was impossible to check.
How?
A pleasure. Pity about Bella.
Right, that checks out here.
I hope it's not the oven again.
The key!
I don't have it. I don't know where it is.
Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
We're gonna die, Boiler. We're gonna die.
Oh, God...
Doolittle, are you there?
Time to start talking.
Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.
Well, I show a 95% probability of sentient life in the Horsehead Nebula...
Well, it is kind of a long shot...
Detonation in six minutes, twenty seconds.
Bomb #20 to Sergeant Pinback. Roger, I read you, continue.
Hello, bomb.
In the beginning there was darkness, and the darkness was without form and void.
I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
I read you, Lieutenant Doolittle, but I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
I am always receptive to suggestions.
But how do you know you exist?
Right!
All right now, here's the big question: how do you know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct?
To explode, of course.
That is correct.
Hmmm...
...nine seconds...
I have no proof that it was false data.
I'll check it.
Doolittle...
Oh, sure.
Okay, Doolittle, I'll have it in a minute.
I like it up here.
...You see, I can watch things up here, Doolittle. I love to watch things, just stare at the planets and meteors and asteroids, gas clusters...
Lieutenant Doolittle, I'm getting a definite malfunction on one of the closed-circuit computer systems...
Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.
Doolittle... I think it's the Phoenix Asteroids!
No kidding?
I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.
Phenomenology...
Yeah.
I'm on a break.
Or we could go another way 'cause your boss seems to like my face just the way it is.
That's not why we're here.
But the boss knows I always been loyal.
Justine was not an unwilling participant.
No time.
No way.
Don't look down.
A grand.
I ain't mad at you...
Later.
It's a rule.
Am I?
Thanks, it's starting to kick in.  I feel almost human.
Yech...
Just thought maybe he'd like a little coffee with his saliva.
Can you help me get her back?
Hello...
If I'm sad, or tired, or sometimes when I'm angry or when somebody's being mean to me.
When?
First time I ever heard that.
We didn't get a chance to finish our conversation the other night.
That would be appropriate, yes.
The other ones?
The technical term for you is "chimera"...
Like extra virgin olive oil, the best of the best.
I don't know what to say.
And you still think you can do something to change that.
Ladies would be elsewhere.
She may be easy on the eyes but she's trouble, trust me.  Hot run to two-oh-two Sansomme.
To set the record straight about where he was the other night when he said he was working late.
He got the car in a trade for his old pick-up and some food...no bill of sale or nothing.  It was right after the pulse so all the DMV records were wiped.  So we don't get anything on the seller.  Except I actually managed to find this guy, six hours on the phone... Say thank you.
They don't exactly have a search engine for finding a bunch of kids with bar- codes on their necks, which is something I'm not even going to ask about--
You and me both.
Got a pencil?
One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma.
Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
And back at ya.  Only there's a part of you that's... I don't know--
And because I actually kinda feel sorry for guys sometimes.
They don't have a lot of moving parts.
Quite a mouth on a girl so young...  ...but my guess is talking is not what it does best.
Pull the cash.
She's gonna want to hear for herself.
Tell everybody hey.
Lame, self-serving, arrogant...guilty as charged.
Exactly.
She had me followed the other day and found out about Natalie.  Now, this person's demanding I blow her off or she'll do it for me by telling Nat about us.
I'm a toy to her.
Who either doesn't care, or could have me killed.  Either way, Natalie's still gonna find out.
You set up on Lydia.  When she's on her way over to the apartment you give me the heads up.  I answer the door and pretend to be Natalie.
--a philandering pig.
Lydia may not have been one of humanity's finer specimens but--
You would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she's the villain in the piece... You are.
I was on call. 
I'm taking the rest of the day off 'cause I'm not feeling so hot.
Theo's dead.
My name's not Woody, it's Haw-haw...
More than anything in the world.
Yeah, a man's drink...
Save your money, stud muffin. The lady at the end of the bar sends her love.
Amanda Finch. Her ex is one of the wealthiest businessmen in Detroit. Play your cards right and you could hit paydirt. She like 'em young.  And since you look a little new at this, let me give you three words of advice. Hard to get. Think it, act it, know it, be it. Nothing a woman loves more than when you beat her at her own head games.
Look, people undress in public because, A, they're exhibitionists, B, they're nutcases, or C, they need the money. I can tell you're not A, and I hope to hell you're not B. So my suggestion is, think about why you're a C and let your body party, shake your groove thing, boogie oogie oogie till you just can't boogie no more.
It's okay.
Peter Criss is my inspiration, man. If I paid a hundred bucks for a KISS show and all I saw was his solo, I'd consider it... money... Hey, how'd you know that?
Whatever... stella.
Stan Lee couldn't think of a better one.
Totally. All I've had for chow was a packet of Pop Rocks and a Yoo-hoo.
What's in Sandusky?
I've been in love with her since the second grade.
I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life.
Then lighten up. She'll never know we touched it. Alright, here's the plan. We bus it to chez Lex, grab the Volvo, bail Jam the hell outta St. Bernard's and arrive at the train station precisely on time for the 2:45 to Detroit.
The paint!
...Holy shit! I am in absolute trouble! I never should have let you drive, man! Absolute fuckin' trouble!
Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan.
And if it ain't cleaned off?
No, I'm dumber than a goddamn slug. Now can I please clean your windshield and leave without further ado?
Excuse me, I'm a little deef-a- hearin'. Can you repeat yourself?
Go ahead, Jam.
NOW!
Uhh... nothing.
Just keep your lying, heathenous trap shut, Jeremiah.
I just lost my virginity in a confessional booth! Lord have mercy!!
Well then, I suggest you have a seat on the bench behind you and think of something a little juicier to confess than losing KISS tickets. I realize this is Detroit, but I personally find, what that rock and roll band is all about, to be boring as Lucifer's kingdom. I'll return in a little while.
Alright, Father, here it is. About two weeks ago I went to my cousin's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if I wanted to take a bath.
I had a nightmare once that something like this might happen. I hope he doesn't get grounded again. If he misses Peter Criss's drum solo, I don't know if he'll be able to handle it.
Simple-icity is more like it. And you guys thought Jam was in trouble before. Wait till Mrs. Bruce finds out he went to that concert with us.
Hello summer detention.
Don't try to run, maggot. Chongo's an all-state track star in every event.
It's not nearly enough, punk.
The KISS Army!
Not if I shoot first!
Yeah, you did!
GOOD MORNING!
GOOD MORNING!
Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.
You'll know soon enough.
You have to do something for me first.
Hey...
He stabbed my mom four times in the chest.
He fled. They still can't find him.  My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool.
Wonder where we'll be then.
So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?
With, like, images?
What's wrong with you?
Where is she?
There's something you have to know, Gretchen.  Everything is going to be just fine.
Where are we going?
Why? Is this about the book?
Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions.
When did you stop taking your medication?
We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table.
That is a terrible nickname.
Do you get to meet Ed?
Do they know yet?
So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
A lot of people. Teachers. Younger kids. It's like they're afraid of me for some reason.  But that's OK... because I know I deserve it.
Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human?
Of course. A rabbit is not like us. It has no history books... it has no knowledge of sorrow or regret. I like bunnies and all. They're cute... and they're horny. And if you're cute and horny... then you're probably happy that you don't know who you are... or why you're even alive. But the only thing I've known rabbits to do is have sex as many times as possible before they die.
A famous linguist once said... that of all the phrases in the English language, of all the endless combinations of words in all of history... that "Cellar Door" is the most beautiful.
Sometimes it's the only thing that keeps us going.
I think I already have.  But now she won't even talk to me.
Would you like to talk about this friend?
Frank.
How so?
Into the future.  Then he said that the world was coming to an end.
I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.
I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.
It was just like she described them in her book. Like they were alive. The way that they looked... moved... smelled. They were like workers... assigned to each one of us.  I followed my spear... and I found something...
What else makes you feel regret?
You've done it again?
God exists because you're horny.
If the sky were to suddenly open up... there would be no law... there would be no rule. There would only be you and your memories... the choices you've made and the people you've touched. The life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged... by which you must judge yourself. Because when this world ends, there will only be you and him... and no one else.
You will survive this... Donald. I promise you that you will survive. You must let me help you.  And when I clap my hands together, you will wake up.
Thank you.
Maybe you'd like to tell Mom and Dad why you stopped taking your medication.
I was just being honest.
Okay, but it has to be a small one.
Well, Gerald, I think you're afraid.
What I think is going on with your son.
Come again?
Don't worry, Mom. Just go, you'll miss your flight.
Yep.
The PTA is here to acknowledge that there is pornography in our school's curriculum.
Kitty...
Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon.
Beg pardon?
But now you can't go.
Mr. Cole... not only am I a TEACHER... but I am also a PARENT of a Middlesex child. Therefore, I am the ONLY person here who transcends the parent-teacher bridge.
The bottom line... Mr. Cole... is that there is material being taught to our children that is cause for this destructive behaviour.
Oh-yah.
I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.
This came for you, sweetie.
Okay, sweetie, that's all right. Let's go. Let's go.
Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out!
I -- I -- I -- I -- I --, j-uh-j-uh- just wanted to compe-e-e-e-ete.
Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't.
What?!
It's me... I just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. This pageant's your ticket outta here. I know you can win, Amber.
We all do. Now let's go.
Oh, Amber, like you're the only one who visits Mary.
You heard me. Where is it?
Here, have some.
Yah -- I brought her some flowers this morning. She's in the room next to my mom. She's super happy.
Yes, Leslie!
Oh, Jesus H. Christ!
"Most smartest?" Oh, that's good, Loretta. Make sure you get a picture of that. "Most smartest." We're cuttin you off and sendin' you home.
All right, they're makin' a movie.
It smells funny. Like gasoline.
Ohio...
What?
All right, then.
Tammy Curry?
I wonder how she's gonna fix that one.
Gladys! Stop it!
That's why we Lutherans use grape Koolaid for the blood of Christ.
Yeah.
Okay, everybody, listen up!
Don't make me kick-ya where the good Lord split-ya.
Come on! Hankey here can't help it if he was born crazier than a shithouse rat!
English! English, you stupid little retard! We America now, Tina!
Tina! Tina!! TINA!!!
What, you deaf? I say shut up -- shut up -- SHUT UP!  Cut her outta this!
"My dear"...
He could be playing solitaire, but I don't think so.
I no gotta new-rosis.  My uncle he's- a got a flower shop -- he's-a gotta new-rosis.
He's half poodle and half watch dog -
Yankee Poodle.
Did you shoot the rapids?
If there was an open season for fellows like you, I'd get myself a hunting license.   Anyway, I'm going to make you a sporting proposition. You give up the peanut stand and I'll make you vice-president of the country.
In that case you'll have to take a civil service examination --  if you pass I'll put you in the post-office -- stick out your tongue.
I've got just the job for you -- Secretary of War.
By the way, are you sure we need a spy?
We've gotta have somebody who knows how to get secrets from men.  You know how to make love?
I can't do it...
That's all right.  We let you have twenty-five thousand men -- and we both start even.
No. Seventy-five -- seventy-five.
Yes, one gross of bullets, two dozen hand-grenades, three kegs of powder -- and throw in some matches.
All right -- I'll go out and find one.
I can't do it right away.
If chewing gum is chewed, The chewer is pursued And in the hoosegow hidden...
If any form of pleasure is exhibited Report to me and it will be prohibited.  I'll put my foot down; So shall it be - This is the land of the free.  The last man nearly ruined this place He didn't know what to do with it.  If you think this country's bad off now Just wait 'till I get through with it.  The treasury is low on dough; The last man went and flew with it.  If you think we're short of money now Just wait 'till I get through with it.  The country's taxes must be fixed - And I know what to do with it, If you think you're paying too much now, Just wait 'till I get through with it. 
Twenty million dollars is a considerable sum...  I'll have to discuss that with my Minister of Finance.
Can't we go some place where we can be alone?
You worm!
Yes.
I don't remember.
You're not so bad yourself, Mrs. Teasdale, when I look at you I can see that we're facing a crisis. We've got to balance the budget -- we've got to cut down everything including, you.
But Your Excellency -- the Ambassador is here on a friendly visit...  He came to ask you to patch up the breach.
Take a seat -- you're next. 
Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?
This is terrible!
My dear niece -- I must ask you not to interfere.  War is not a woman's problem.
I thought everything was working out fine.
Perhaps he will listen to you...
I've always thought that myself.
She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her.
I'll join you shortly.
Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?
Well, I wasn't sure whether he was parroting me because that's all he was capable of, or whether he sensed that that's all I wanted to hear, and he was trying to please me.
He is. I mean, I've always thought he was. I think he must be. Is he simple? Or is that just something I've wished upon him to make things simpler for myself?
Oh... I've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said.
...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?
Did you see it?
I'll get my bag.
I'll show you! I'll show you!
Shut up!
He fell.  He falls.
Why is he sitting up like this? He needs rest.
I know what you've done to him and he's never going back to that.
You don't own this man!
So you can beat him? So you can starve him? A dog in the street would fare better with you!
Good morning, sir.
Yes, I'm well aware of that. But this case is quite exceptional.
He's doing very well. In fact that's why I came to see you. I think that if I were to present Mr. Merrick to the hospital committee, then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease, but of the man as well. If the committee had a chance to speak with him, hear him say a few words for himself, I'm sure they would see him as a patient, rather than as a violation of the rules.
Then will you meet him, as a representative of the committee.
He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?
I am very pleased to meet you.
Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
Good day, Mr. Merrick.
I fear not, Mrs. Kendal. Even in the short time he was gone the size of his head has increased rapidly... as is his pain.
...I learned a long time ago.
Yes John!
Yyyess.
My name is...
Say "Merrick".
Very good, very good. Now, when your visitor comes today I want you to say it exactly the way you said it just now. I will introduce him to you and you will say the words you've learned. If you have any trouble with any of the words, I'll help you. I'm sure you'll be just fine. If you do as well for him as you've done for me these last two days, then I'm sure our visitor will be very pleased. Now, let's go through the whole thing again, shall we? I will say "May I introduce you to Mr. Carr Gomm." And you will say...
Oh yes! It is much better than what I am used to.
Of course! What did you think?
Oh yes.
Yes, John.
Yes, very soon.
Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright, did I make any mistakes that you can see?
You too, my friend. Goodnight.
Yes. John wants it.
John thinks it's very dashing. Something no gentleman should be without. I'm inclined to agree.
Welcome home, John.
Take him? Now wait... I didn't take him anywhere. We were just having some fun. We didn't hurt him... just having a laugh, that's all.
When I left him, he was in his bed, safe and sound.
I don't think so. No sir, we're closed.
Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.
She did, I tell you! She could blind me as easily as the night the day.
But, Father, it IS!
Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well...
We never went to bed together.
I've never been to bed with anybody!
But, Erik...
Why?
Not quite...
But, Aud... I... I came to find someone...
What d'you mean?
I shouldn't have come.
Of course not... but... when I was a child... I remember a dream.... it was as if the whole sky was blue...
That I cannot tell you.
Right! Summon the musicians! We'll do the one that goes "TUM-TUM-TUM- TUM-TI-TUM-TUM"
No, no... It was very... er, nice.
Oh! No! No... of course not... it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big.
You don't love ME.
And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on.
I didn't mean to!
But...
No.
I know!
I know. I know.
She got me thinking...
That's my boy!
Now stop it!
Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there. Harald, you'd better sit over there...
Now you've got all the ones with beards on one side and all the moustaches on the other.
Has anyone told him we've got a dragon eating our boat?
Oh... I feel a little... oh...
Who gets killed?
Keitel Blacksmith?
What's the matter with Bjorn?
We'd be the first!
Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING?
Bye... sorry...
The Dragon...
Do what?
I thought I might do a bit of business on the way.
Bastard.
That's it! AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory.
Hang on...
I... I...
It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon... 
You can't let Erik do THAT.
Help!
I know, Dad.
I KNOW! I'VE HEARD IT ALL 1 THOUSAND TIMES!
No, Mother.
But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? I mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff?
Ucch, really? You're kidding. God. Bizarre small world, huh? Yeah, that's me: book slave there for, like, five years now.
Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.
Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names. How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole.
I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?
I don't know what that means.
Probably see you at the book store.
You can't be too careful. I've been stalked. I've been told I'm highly stalkable. I don't need that.
Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --
Well, I wouldn't want to be --
Drink up, young man. It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.
Sounds good. But right now I should go.
You'll call me, right?
Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.
Where are you going?
You're not ready.
No. Thanks.
Yeah, Tangerine?
Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!
I came over to the bed and you smelled so good, like you just woke up, slightly sweaty. And I climbed on the bed with you and you said something like --
Naomi, I guess.
What was I wearing?
But you weren't. I could tell.
Is that what you want?
Sorry to track you down like this. I'm not a stalker. But I needed to see you.
Okay.
And you picked it out of my plate before I could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers.
yeah?
I love you.
Yeah.
I don't know.
I'm nervous, too.
Says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests.
I guess so.
That's what you have to say? How could it be true? I never even heard of any procedure like this. It's a joke.
I know. I spoke to my friend Magda.
Joel, we've fucked. We've made love. Like a million times. And we were so sweet and shy and inept with each other last night. Isn't that lovely?
Guess what I'm wearing.
There you are.  Naomi, it's just... I'm afraid if we fall back into this fast without considering the problems we had...
Maybe I'm making a mistake. Maybe I just need to learn to live with this. First of all, I'll get over it. Secondly, it happened. Those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it. Who said that? Churchill? I'm not sure. But I don't care. She did it to me. I have to rid myself of this. Fuck her.
That's your look for me.
I loved you on this day. I love this memory. The rain. Us just hanging.
Is there any sort of risk of brain damage?
Well... I did.
You have to stop this!
Don't do this to me now, Joel. Really.
I better do this, Stan.
It's a good one all right.
Go.
Yeah.
You love him, don't you?
Hi.
Yes?
Cole slaw, ice tea?
How do you mean?
It's no big deal.
Really? I thought it was appropriate maybe. That's all.  I really admire the work that you do. I know it's not proper to be so familiar but I guess since we're outside the workplace I feel a certain liberty to --
The guy we're doing? He's disappeared from the map. I can't find him anywhere.
1062 Sherman Drive. Apartment 1E, Rockville Center.
Yeah, probably a good idea.
I don't know what you're talking about, Howard.
Maybe after the holidays then.
Just wanted to let you know.
She likes you okay.
This one's history. Moving on...
Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
Save your breath for the climb.
Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink?
Easy come, easy go.
You might say that, although I don't think of it as traveling.
Oh, Rupert and Carla had a little hassle and went home.
Well, that doesn't matter; that part never interested me anyway. The beatnicks were before my time, and I never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope, clichés and the clap. But the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl.
Oh, we didn't get it all the way on.
If we Ivy Leaguers aren't earthy enough to suit you hillbillies, at least we don't go around indulging in racist terms such as 'Chink.' Next thing I know, you'll be calling me 'chief.'
I have to go, Julian.
My thumbs hurt. I've made a mistake. I've been negligent. I haven't exercised. I have to hitchhike a little bit every day, no matter what. It's like a musician practicing his scales. When I don't practice, my timing gets off, my thumbs get stiff and sore.
Yep.
When I was younger, I hitchhiked one hundred and twenty-seven hours without stopping, without food or sleep, crossed the continent twice in six days, cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways.
As I developed, however, I grew more concerned with subtleties and nuances of style. Time in terms of M.P.H. no longer interested me. I began to hitchhike in something akin to geological time: slow, ancient, vast. When I am really moving, stopping car after car after car, moving so freely, so clearly, so delicately that even the sex maniacs and the cops can only blink and let me pass, then I embody the rhythms of the universe. I am in a state of grace.
Tired...
A born freak can only go uphill.
I've always been proud of the way nature singled me out. It's the people who have been deformed by society I feel sorry for. I've been steady moving for eleven years and some months. Maybe I should rest up for a spell, I'm not as young as I used to be.
Your ranch?
A job for me?
Shit O dear, that's enough to make me asthmatic. The nerve of those twits. What do they know about female odor? Don't interrupt. Here's my concept. My ranch out West? It's a beauty ranch. Oh, it's got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and tax purposes. But it's a beauty ranch, a place where unhappy women -- divorcees and widows, mainly -- can go to lose weight, remove wrinkles, change their hair styles and pretty themselves up for the next disappointment. My ranch is named the Rubber Rose, after the Rubber Rose douche bag, my own invention, and bless its little red bladder, the most popular douche bag in the world. So get this. It's on the migratory flight path of the whooping cranes. The last flock of wild whooping cranes left in existence. Well, these cranes stop off at my little pond -- Siwash Lake, it's called -- twice a year, autumn and spring, and spend a few days each time, resting up, eating, doing whatever whooping cranes do. I've never seen them, understand, but I hear they're magnificent. Very big specimens -- I mean, huge mothers -- and white as snow, to coin a phrase, except for black tips on their wings and tail feathers, and bright red heads. Now, whooping cranes, in case you didn't know it, are noted for their mating dance. It's just the wildest show in nature. It's probably the reason why birdwatching used to be so popular with old maids and deacons. Picture these rare, beautiful, gigantic birds in full dance -- leaping six feet off the mud, arching their backs, flapping their wings, strutting low to the ground. Dears, it's overwhelming. And picture the birds doing their sex dance on TV. Right there on the home screen, creation's most elaborate sex ritual -- yet clean and pure enough to suit the Pope. With lovely Sissy Hankshaw in the foreground. In a white gown, red hood attached, and big feathery sleeves trimmed in black. In a very subdued imitation of the female whooping crane, she dance/walks over to a large nest in which there sits a can of Yoni Yum. And a can of Dew. Off-camera, a string quartet is playing Debussy. A sensuous voice is reading a few poetic lines about courtship and love. Are you starting to get it? Doesn't it make the hair on your neck stand up and applaud? My very goodness gracious! Grandiose, lyrical, erotic and Girl Scout- oriented; you can't top it. I've hired a crew of experts from Walt Disney Studios, the best wildlife cinematographers around. You're my eternal favorite. Princess Grace herself couldn't be better, not even if she had your personality which she doesn't; Anyway, dear, I'm out of photography now and into water colors. Ah how circuitous conversation is! We're back at the beginning. The exact man I've wanted you to meet is my artist the watercolorist.
Well, okay. I'll try it. I don't see the point in it, but I'll try it. Just for you. It's kind of silly, actually, me going out with an artist in New York City. However...
I am your best friend. I am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker...
EVERYBODY SHUT UP! Let the man speak.
You're convinced the crew could still be alive? After seven years?
You prep the gravity couches. I'm going to manually arm those explosives.
What about the accumulator...?
We're still venting trace gasses, gimme twenty minutes to plug the hole.
What?
Hurry.
No time. We need whatever's left in our suits to repair the Clark. Like it or not, this is the only oxygen for three billion kilometers.
I don't need sleep, DJ. I need answers.
"Another man?" Who?
Oh, God, DJ, what do I... how do I...
Pressure?
He's crashing...
His peritoneum has ruptured...
Navigation Control tried to hail the vessel. This was the only response.
That doesn't mean a damn thing. They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill. But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship.
It's been two years since she died. He's over it.
The dark inside me.
Yes, sir!
Almost done, I just gotta check one thing...
This is not about my reputation! This is not about me at all!  The Event Horizon was created for one reason: to go faster than light. Imagine mankind exploring new solar systems, colonizing new worlds. Seven years ago, we didn't just lose the ship and the crew. We lost the dream.  I have to go.
I don't know, this place is really dark, I can't see a thing...
Smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster.
Negative.
One of my men is down. I want to know what happened to him.
"Insane?" The finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship. It would take the Lewis and Clark a thousand years to reach our closest star. The Event Horizon could be there in a day...
The Core...!
Yes...
You can't, your orders are specific...
Watch me.
You know.
I'm not the Devil.
Better if I just show you.
Locked and cocked.
That's not it. That ship was built to go faster than light... That's just wrong, it goes against everything we know...
Smith, where the hell have you been?!
Captain, we got a problem.
Come around to three-three-four...
Radiation interference?
How much oh-two do we have?
Carbon dioxide?
We can take the filters from the Clark...
Not acceptable. I want to know what's causing those readings. If the crew is dead, I want the bodies, I want the crew found.
To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive?
We're hanging on by our fingernails and you're giving me bullshit stories...
Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible.
You better hurry. He's engaged the override, we can't open the inner door.
No. I'll be right back.
Isn't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge?
It's cold.
Say this paper represents space-time, and you want to get from "point A" here...  ...to "point B," here.  Now: what's the shortest distance between two points?
It still has air and reserve power, we can activate gravity and life support.
The law of relativity prohibits faster- than-light travel...
Matching speed... now. Range to target ten thousand meters and closing... Skipper, I got a bad feeling about this...
Range 3000 meters and closing.
I wouldn't know anything about that.
Is it safe?
Don't come any closer for a sec. This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
Deb, it's me. It's still me.
You'd never know it.
Ben, the money's not important. We could save lives.
I'm sure he's matured since then.
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
Well maybe you should date him.
Ben. Are you okay?
This isn't permanent, Johnny. We need to be careful until we're normal again.
Yeah. I can tell. Victor was right.
Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--
Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look.
'Course not. Strictly business.
Give me the god damn mirror!
The Center for Disease Control. If this thing is contagious --
I don't know if "we've" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are right outside that window --
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
Stay right. Left is trouble.
This place is deluxe. You got cable?
Gotcha. Okay. Supernova bad.
I think that thing is Ben.
You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
Look around, sis! She's not here. So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --
That's why. Because I could have any other woman... You know, when they asked Caesar "why England," he said, "because it's not mine."
Right. That's exactly what I meant.
We need to get past them.
That's what we're here to find out.
What about you? You haven't eaten in days. How come you're never on this side of the microscope?
Excuse me?
I'm sure I can come up with something.
Are you kidding?
I did. I did, Reed... but I wanted you to be that man.
Hilarious.
Sure.
Get a grip. Reed. We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch. Just close the shields...
Ben did this.
What I should have done a long time ago. Applications and patents, Reed. This all belongs to me.
Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps. And this is the biggest step yet. If it helps, think of this as a promotion. A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
Susan. What are you doing?
Same old Reed. All analysis, no action. Wasn't that the problem with you two?
Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it? You're finally the perfect woman for him... because you're his science project.
Come on, Spicoli. Why don't you just put your shirts back on? See the sign?
No. I want my money back right now.
Don't strain yourself.
I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson?
Are you kidding? Work is great. I kill at work. I don't even mind Mom and Dad making me pay rent.
I didn't say that.
No.
But they weren't mine.
Dad says you're late again, you butthole!
Come on...
Let's continue.
Mike, there's something that's been on my mind and I have to tell you about it.
I know it's yours.
We've got to get an abortion?
It's already planned, Mike. It's going to cost $150 at the Free Clinic.
Half. Okay?  Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic.
Damone, you gotta listen to me.
No. It's too soon.
Really?
The Attitude? The Attitude dictates that you don't care if she comes, stays, lays or prays. Whatever happens, your toes are still tappin'. When you are the cruelest and the coolest... then you have The Attitude.
I hear they all dress like that at Lincoln now.
What do you mean? Men have died trying to obtain this information. I will give it to you for free.
No. It's too late. The food is coming and everything. Damone, I've got to ask you this favor, and I'll never ask you for anything again in this lifetime or any other. Will you please borrow your mom's car, go by my house, get my wallet, and meet me back here?
Wow. I've been looking for that thing! Hey, Damone, have you met Stacy Hamilton? Stacy, this is Mike Damone.
Really.
I always stick up for you. Whenever people say 'Aw, that Damone is a loudmouth' -- and they say that a lot -- I say 'You just don't know Damone.' When someone says you're an idiot, I tell them 'Damone's not an idiot. You just don't know him.' Well, you know, Damone, maybe they do know you pretty good. And I'm just finding out.
You're crazy. Those girls love me.
So what makes you so sensitive?
Yeah, well, I saw the movie. That must mean I'm sensitive too.
And they don't call my parents?
Totally.
Naw. Any good?
Listen, Stace, you want to know about guys? I'll tell you. They're mostly chicken. Before I met Doug I chased after every guy I thought was cute. I thought if I gave out a vibe they'd get the message and call me up. Well, guess what? They don't call.
Really?
What variables?
Oh! That's where that group got its name from.
Come on, Linda. It's just sex.
Not since November.
No. But it's a nice idea.
I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
He works for the airline. He'll be out here. You'll meet him.
I know. He hates to have to wear uniforms.
I don't know... I just don't feel right.
What do you think it is?
I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.
That little prick.
There goes your stereo for another year. Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick. I'm not letting him get away with this.
Yeah, like maybe never.
Oh, please. I get so lonely when that third attendance bell rings and I don't see all my kids here.
I've been thinking about this, Mr. Hand. If I'm here... and you're here... doesn't that make it our time?
And you, my friend. I'll see you for a two-hour detention every afternoon this week.
Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a question?
No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building.
Aloha, Spicoli.
We keep them, in case the people come back.
Yeah. She is pretty good.
Oh yeah.
Not at all.
I'd like that.
You did the right thing. Never try to understand a press message. About half the time we use codes -- especially with Dr. Gonzo.
Listen, you fuzzy little shithead -- I've been fucked around, in my time, by a fairly good cross-section of mean-tempered rule-crazy cops and now it's MY turn. "Fuck you, officer, I'm in charge here, and I'm telling you we don't have room for you."
My bags are out there in that white Cadillac convertible. Can you have someone drive it around to the room?
Ah, yes. Mr. Duke? You have one message: "Call Lucy at the Americana Hotel, room 1600."
Crying? Why was she crying?
Don't worry. You're protected. Just treat this poor woman like you'd treat any other human being in trouble.
You're another one of these California boys. Your friend here's been tellin' us about dope fiends.
One toke. You poor fool. Wait till you see those goddamn bats.
My heart!
God didn't do that! You did it! You're a fucking narcotics agent, that was our cocaine, you pig!
You whore!
If you think we're in trouble now wait until you see what's happening in the elevators.
To do the job, of course. Here we go... a Crab Louie and quart of muscatel for twenty dollars!
Did the mescaline just kick in? Or was that Debbie Reynolds in a silver Afro wig?!
Look over there. Two women fucking a Polar Bear.
Not much. Why?
Room service sent it up. I wanted something to cut the limes.
They didn't have any. They don't grow in the desert.
I dig my own graves. Green water and the White Rabbit. Put it on.
Shit. I met her on the plane and I had all that acid.  You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... she's a religious freak... Jesus, she's never even had a drink.
You'll go straight to the gas chamber. And even if you manage to beat that, they'll send you back to Nevada for Rape and Consentual Sodomy. She's got to go.
It just occurred to me, that she has no witnesses. Anything that she says about us is completely worthless.
Just the other day we had a case where they grabbed a girl right out of a McDonald's hamburger stand. She was a waitress, about sixteen years old... with a lot of people watching, too!
They were all veterans.
They'll fight like hell if you try to take the head without the dogs.
Right!
No! I swear I'm not!
You and a lot of other people.
Where is everyone?
Yeah.
But it's got teeth.
C'mon guys--
Come on, come on.
And the head?
No, no, no it was... it was wild out there, no time to think, we just moved. He didn't leave me. He just ran.  He just ran.
Easy.
There's a tunnel.
It's in the basement, about a hundred yards long. It spits out on the backside of that hill down the way. There's a truck there.
Fuck you too.
Oh yeah?
Yep.
We lived near power lines.
What?
But not flush against the tunnel?
Sure.
He only shot you once.
No one goes anywhere alone. Least of all, unarmed.
What?
Huh?
Nothing.
Grass. I grow some pot down there. It's no big deal, just something I dabble in. The truck's for a quick get away, deliveries, whatever.
Fully.
Oh? And what's that?
F-f-fuck you.
You smell like ass!
Duh hickey.
What?
Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
You keep that key handy.
If he doesn't shut up...
As long as it's dark, they're around. They hide, wait for you to drop your guard, and then attack.
Whoa!
Let's lock off this room.
But we've been at it since six this morning. At least you could've let me go home and change.
You're right. I'm sorry.  Okay, let's go get 'em.
I don't know who she fucked to get where she is, but I don't think it was me.
Who's this?
Very fine bone structure.
But I'm the one up there on the screen.
Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way.
I'm not!
What?
Who is she?
An actress.
Yes. That's the deal. She plays Lorna.
I know, but --
Right now we have to be practical.
Who?
Dick, I can't even breathe here...
The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her.
Frances, we gotta do it this way. Just remember tomorrow, remember what I told you. What're you gonna tell 'em?
I'm afraid not. You see, we observe things that you're unaware of: signs, indicators. Your problem cuts very deep, Frances, and we have to get at that deeper stuff so that when you do get out, you'll really feel secure. Does that make sense?
We'll talk more about this. I'll see you later.
But I'll never win that.
Really?
See you next weekend, Dad.
I know.
You really want to go?
Be careful, Francie.
What you have to understand, Francie, is that she... well... she wanted so much for herself too, and for me, and she never really got to... The only time I ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers... but she could have been... if times were different she could have been a politician or... I don't know.
Always. Always.
Please, Francie...
I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve...
Oh, Angela! Go with these trappers! They'll lead you safely down the mountain...
Just put me down as a avg -- a vagrant vagabond. Come on, this is a joke! Assault and battery? I barely touched that bitch!
Are you really serious? About acting?
Then don't go to Hollywood.
No, I don't hate it.
Will you be getting back together? When you quit Hollywood, I mean.
You're wasting your time, lady. Nothing's off the record with me.
Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?
Well... see the papers've got us pegged as pinkos, then you come along, the friendly neighborhood atheist --
Well aren't you the smoothie. Now you're going to ask for my number, I suppose.
Harry.
What happened to him?
Come on, Harry. This is America, land of the free.  I thought we might go skinny dipping.  For starters.
Yup. Poor bastard lay there on the sidewalk and he couldn't die. Too god damn much heart. He just didn't want to die.
Well, the studio told me not to.
Dick... and my mother! She acts like she's on Mars or something --
Forget it.
He deserves a show. He missed the movie.
Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?
For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter.
I took the early rounds.
And?
That's right.
Whattaya think you're in now?
...Touch me again and I'll kill you, you pig.
I love you too, Frances.
Oh please, Harry... don't even think it. You're the only person who ever... It's just... Can't you wait for me?
No, Harry, it's not time, it's us. You and me. And I'm telling you now that I'll come to you, okay? I'll find you. I will.
Yes.
Why, certainly. I wanted to get a peek at his face...
Sure it's true. I was fighting for my country as well as myself.
Fine!
I know, but I'm not seeing it. It's there, Frances, the fire is there, but it's not coming through. You're lazy --
Good. Then it's very simple. You have to stop being afraid, Frances. It's in you.
Why are these all opened?
Not long.
Sure.
No. No, it all depends on what offers I get.
No, Mama, I'll take care of it. I'll wash them in the morning.
Excuse me.
Sure. You shouted at me in the auditorium when I read my essay.
Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?
Do you really believe your mother's trying to kill you?
Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?
Frances, I'm warning you...
No!
Yeah?
You're kidding.
What?
Yes. I have been seeking my friends.
Materials. Nothing more.
There is something I want.  A friend.
We'd travel north, my bride and I. To the furthest reaches of the Pole, where no man has ever set foot. There we would live out our lives. Together.  No human eye would ever see us again. This I vow.
I will not! Kill me now!
It's far too late for him to still be out.
He left a beautiful gift in her place. A baby boy. To cherish and love as our very own. Your brother
Quite a send-off, isn't it?
To be the best there ever was. To push our knowledge beyond our dreams... to eradicate disease and pestilence... to purge mankind of ignorance and fear...
Is that what makes it so delicious?
Only you.
I'm all right. I'm safe,
A month at most, that's all I ask.  Elizabeth, please. Things have not yet resolved. I must take steps to see that they do. For our family's sake. For our sake.  You are life itself. We shall seal our vow. The moment I am done.
Come now. Magnus? Agrippa? Next thing you know, you'll be teaching toadstools to speak.
Can you think of a better reason?
Do me a favor then...  ...keep them to yourself.
You're a comfort to me, Henry.
These are exciting times, Henry. We're entering an era of amazing breakthroughs. Look at Edward Jenner. He wasn't content to bleed people with leeches, he pioneered a new frontier of thought
Good. I'll be there to hear his worthless neck snap.
Why Waldman? He of all people should have cheated death!
I resent God's monopoly.
That is my concern.  I'm involved in something just now. I want to finish it in Waldman's memory.
Listen to what I'm saying. The militia's arriving to quarantine the city. Most of us are getting out while we still can.
So you have claimed. Yet you have no explanation for this.  The locket last seen in the hands of the poor murdered child was found hidden in your dress the morning following the murder. The locket you so coveted.  How did it come to be in your possession?
Those which stir the imagination as well as the intellect. Paracelsus, for one.
Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius Agrippa...
I once saw it done, as a boy in Canton. My parents were missionaries. The cure was nothing short of miraculous.  I've never forgotten it. Been fascinated ever since.
I can't say I blame them. We're trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of... creature.
Madness?
You told her to sweep the courts.
Thanks, Alice.
I finished the boats.
Everybody except the girl who's supposed to handle the kitchen. Annie.
And then Steve looks at you with those hurt eyes -- like you don't care about children...
Good point.
Okay.
Wet. I don't know.
Come on, Claudette. A man's not made of stone.
I need you so much, Claudette.
Here we go.
Don't get up. Take a second...
I figured if I didn't save you. I'd have to give you mouth-to-mouth and that would have ruined my appetite.
A short somewhere.
Get behind him more.
I'll spot you five points.
Dancer.
We wouldn't want you thinking you're the only show-off in camp, would we?
That was the telephone.
Sometimes I only think about kissing women.
I don't love Neddy.
I'm a little scared of storms. Always have been. Since I was a kid.
I call it my shower dream.
Mmmmmmmph.
Girls can't be cowboys.
No, thanks. I'm fine. Sandy.
They'll be okay if they know enough to stay in outta the rain.
...I know what you mean. Two and a quarter. Plus fifteen percent tip to make up for me spending the night alone.
Dad, I watch those reality shows. They never let anybody go. Any cop will tell you, in a situation like this, you get a chance, you go for it. This is our chance.
What's this about, money?
Come again?
Auto wreck.
No. It was a rainy night, the brakes on the car weren't great. She had to stop suddenly. She slid on the road, she crashed, she died.
Yes, they do.
You won't let him touch her?
Well, you just keep thinkin' of that gun next to Kate's temple.
Shit, I been to bars make this place look like a fuckin' 4-H club.
I'm gonna just sit here and drain this bottle. And when I've drunk the last drop, if I still feel then, the way I feel now, I'm gonna take this bottle and break it over his melon head.
To yours.
You bet your sweet ass you are, and I'm gonna help you do it. But we ain't got much time.
I don't give a shit about living or dying anymore. I just want to send as many of these devils back to hell as I can.
Kate, Scott?
Kate, give your old man a little credit. Every person who chooses the service of God as their life's work has something in common. I don't care if you're a preacher, a priest, a nun, a rabbi or a Buddhist monk. Many, many times during your life you'll look at your reflection in the mirror and ask yourself, am I a fool? We've all done it. I'm not going through a lapse. What I've experienced is closer to awakening. I'm not trying to shake your faith. I've just decided not to devote my life to God anymore.
Other places have beds, they also have cable TV, a gym, room service...
So all we have to do is get by for a few more hours and then we can walk right out the front door.
Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!
I swear to God, our father, that when you change into one of the undead, I will kill you.
Okay.
Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The world's my oyster, except for the fact that I just rammed a wooden stake in my brother's heart because he turned into a vampire, even though I don't believe in vampires. Aside from that unfortunate business, everything's hunky-dory.
Daddy's dead.
Not many.
Me too.
-- you got your microwave --
-- you got your shower --
I'm by myself today, ate my lunch outta the microwave.
Whatsamatter?
That's all that's been on the box all day. They killed some people didn't they?
Knock yourself out.
I'm not dead, but I'm definitely shot! I told you that bastard said, "Help us!"
No.
They don't have anything except four walls and a roof, and that's all we need.
How ya think, it hurts like a son-of- a-bitch.
Sight seein'.
Look, fuck the border. Let's just dig in and wait for things to cool down.
What?
What?
Yes.
No, I didn't.
No, you're not. You're sippin' margaritas in El Ray. But we're not in El Ray. We're here -- getting ready to go in there. You're so pleased with yourself about getting into Mexico, you think the job's down. It ain't. Get back on the clock. That's a fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around there for a coupla hours, in all likelihood, we'll get fucked with. So get your shit together, brother.
It don't look together.
Por favor, Senorita. Would you care to join us?
Or rank.  But can you do me a favor and pull a transfer order?
Who signed as his "sponsoring officer"?
What'd you find, Kathy?
Your prerogative, Senator.
Standing right here in my office.
Thank you, sir.  But I expect a certain amount of pain.
Pardon?
Across the board, sir.
You makin' friends with the press, lieutenant?
Sir...
Only blanks.  Lemme do it.
Did you hear?
California.
Absolutely not.
The reality is this:  We send far too many men off to war.  I don't need to compound the problem with women.  Can you honestly tell me you wanted that life?  Squat-pissing in some third-world jungle with --
I can make this wall without --
Check your watch, Pyro.  Seems fast.
Not doin' them very fine, O'Neil.
Thank you, sir.  We hear back from the Pentagon?
Hate this part.  Just sweating it out on the sidelines.
I take it you don't either.  Feet.
Which is guy-speak for...
You know, right up until you said that -- I thought I did know.
Jordan.  You watch your ass.
And this class officer... "Wickwire."  You think he was just trying to get even?  Striking back for...
Almost like someone put him up to it.  Okay, who?
What about him.
You don't crap out of Spec-Recon and get another shot without dispensation from someone up in flag country.  He's got a Sea Daddy somewhere.
"Yes, Jordan -- I'll wait for you no matter how long."
I think you look beautiful.
This is insane.  You've got no proof.
Maybe half.  Not even.
It seems the men couldn't get used to the sight of women blown open and their viscera hanging from tree limbs.  Israeli men would linger over wounded females -- often to the detriment of the mission, often endangering their own lives.  They don't use women anymore.
Wasn't deemed a threat.
We didn't know we were compromised. Firing would only've given away our position.
Sure.  Just like your men do.
Possibly.  Just to spite DeHaven.
The first female President?
I don't...  What, someone on base?  A "mole"?
Great. See ya then.
All that "you gotta be vicious" stuff you filled her head with.
I just saw him. He's with a bunch of guys who want to sneak into the city tonight.
Lucy'd kill me if she knew.
When you and I use to attend rallies in college, we helped to create awareness. But from the inside now I can actually effect change.  I never lost my idealism.
Yes. The first of its kind. I found this blood sample earlier this evening...
I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You're supposed to be my friend. I trusted you.
Your station won't have any easier time contacting the military than I did.
What do I get?
This is not the place...
What?
Listen, this is the time when the big boys have to go to work, okay Honey?
Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist.
I don't think so.
Me too.
Allez, allez!
That is when we will go in.
Well your people are getting in the way of my job.
We know.
No, it's still in my tent. It's...oh my God, she took it.
But you don't know for sure!
Last time you didn't even scratch it!
Sounds like a big company.
Oh.
Are you sure? How do you know?
Oh, my bags. I've checked them in.
This is America. There is nothing you can not buy.
So you're in?
Makes us look more American.
Open.
You'll forgive my impertinence, sir, but even though we had never before met, always considered you as a father to me.
... to camera center no matter whose shot you're blocking...
"Just!?"
We stop we die. Keep holding the thruster down Tommy!
Like YOU know?
What's the scale?  Is that ten miles? A hundred miles?
Must be some sort of mining facility.
You go first! There's no time!
Nothing.
... . Well  you have to figure out what it wants... What's its motivation?
That's your problem.  You were never serious about the caraft...  "I'm a rock... I just want to be a rock... Still. Peaceful.. Tranquil.." ..."Oh, but what's this?  Something's making noise... No, not noise, no... MOVEMENT.  VIBRATIONS.  Make the vibrations stop, they go straight into me like a knife!... I must CRUSH the thing that makes the vibrations..."
I had the shot...
Dear God.... How did I come to this?
Why didn't you stop at the market?
It's okay. Listen-
We'd never have the budget for this.
Yes Commander... All right, you're almost there. Just go through the chompers and over the pit.
Okay, now. But-
Up.
Yes?
We need another one.
All systems are working, Commander.
Right.
Oh I make it up. Use lots of "k"s and "v"s.
I don't like this... I don't like this at all...
Do I? DO I?  For all you know I'm just "CREWMAN #6"!  Okay, it's FLEEGMAN! Guy FLEEGMAN! There! Now I'm a whole person! I can't die! FLEEGMAN! THEY CAN'T KILL ME NOW, CAN THEY? CAN THEY?
We're doing episode 31, Jason?
Yeah, what is it?
Let's just pick up the pace a little, shall we?
No. Keep all energy to the armor.
Where'd they go? Back inside?
Only answers to me.
Let me think. I need time to think.
JASON...
I thought It was the "We're dead" gesture! I was agreeing! Like I know where the hold button is???
No, I don't think so... Wait. They're not but...  Something is.  Oh my god.
Did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you could have held on to me?
Mark 12.
I see them!  I see them! RD STREET	PASADENA 57
Okey dokey, let's fire blue particle cannons full. Fire red particle cannons full. Fire gannet magnets left and right. Fire pulse catapults from all chutes. And throw this thing at him too, killer.
Then tell me one thing... What does it do, the device? The Omega 13.
Please, don't hurt them, it's not their fault. I'm not the Commander, I don't know anything.
Oh, I don't think so. I gave him both barrels.
Jason? What about me? What do I do?
Pedal to the metal...
The core could be hardwired to overload without much effort.
What does she see in them?
Well, you fought with them against the French and Iroquois, how good were they then?
While they're strung out?
There, then, you can have sort of a normal life.
Tell Mrs. Washington I am compelled to stay a while longer.
Yes, general?
I ain't forgot about the freedom.
No, my lord.
Many of them, many did not possess proper arms.  My lord.
I, don't know what color is what officer, my lord...
Lafayette will not be happy...
That's Greene.  He's supporting our reconsolidation.
And is that the most horrible thing in the world?
But it's what he said, just before they killed him:  "I regret that I have but one life to give to my country."
I'm not sure.
I don't know:  delivering men and delivering men with their goodwill are two different things.  And, if he's popular with his men...
Of course the army will acquit him, that's not the point... Arnold is a man and will understand.  What I need to understand is, John, Sam... what is happening here?  Who are those people in there?  The fat ones in silk?
Gag on your own invention, then.
Spies from Quebec confirm that the British are sending an entire fleet down Lake Champlain...
George!  So good to be back!
A ground swell-Christian movement, George, you see?
I mean, I'm a Deist.  A belief I share with the likes of Tom Jefferson and Ben Franklin.  Surely you knew that.
Well, I shall deny him to you!  He is evil on earth!
I... they look both the same.
War?  No!  I did not!  When you said compromise was possible I believed it was probable.  There's no middle ground at all?  We're the King's children!
I'm very aware of that.
And have you heard anything from our dear friend, Sally?  What with all the rumors getting back to England.  I thought she might inquire after us.  But then I believe she always looked down on us.
I think I heard that.
What else?  From Virginia?
Oh, indeed?  You know very well people are frightened of arming the Negroes!  They beg you to consider the future.  What good is a revolution if it overturns those things we cherish!?
I want you to see our hospital.
I have commanded the Rhode Island Militia for a year now.  My father is an ironmaster.  As was I.
Sir, Congress hasn't issued their pay for two months, many have not eaten properly for at least that long.  You're being a little hard on them, don't you think?
You wrong me, general; I am an officer and a horse-shoer.
You've got to stop them here or our whole line will cave-in!  It's all right boys, I'm here!
You know, I came back to Mount Vernon to retire.  I don't need to be in government.
I remember a pair of young philosophers once, who laughed at the world.
That's not what I said!  Now, Sally, you're embarrassing me!  Watch out for her, George; she talks refinement, but she has a barbarous soul!
Words, words, words!  Sally has been tutoring George in the philosophies, isn't that right?
Just because they are born?
Are these philosopher going to be here to help you fight your war? You know why I don't trust revolutions?  Because each of us is who we are:  we make speeches, print pamphlets, and we never change.  The world is not a philosophical abstraction, Mister Adams, it's us.  And, I don't believe you can ever change human nature.
That?  I hear a mob:  unemployed, drunkards, vagabonds... the world's dregs.
Though, sometimes we get frost and that can cut the season.
Yeah, I'm really gonna miss him.
Remember Harry's story about the dry cleaner Palmer was after? Guy who stole the three hundred grand from the airline?
No. What's this?
So you didn't have the key with you.
So... how many movies you been in?
Harvey Keitel. Yeah. Maybe. He was pretty good in the movie "Fingers".
Who?
There's nothin' to know. You have an idea, you write down what you wanna say. Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong, if you aren't positive yourself. Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words... although I've seen scripts where I know words weren't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all. So I don't think it's too important. Anyway, you come to the last page you write in 'Fade out' and that's the end, you're done.
First you and me gotta get a couple things straight.
It was Rio Bravo. Robert Mitchum was the drunk in El Dorado, Dean Martin in Rio Bravo, practically the same part. John Wayne, he also did the same thing in both. He played John Wayne.
It's a different kind of deal.
Leo, I don't know.
That's the magic number.
Who?
'Cause the guy's a customer now, stupid. His ass belongs to me.
Yeah? Which terminal?
Ray Barboni. From Miami.
I'm a producer.
It was C... I don't know, sixteen or seventeen, one of those. Why? You looking for anyway, a bomb or something?
Why don't you get the attendant to open all the lockers and take a look. Maybe you'll find it.
I know what a marker is.
I produce feature motion pictures, no TV. You mentioned Grotesque, that happened to be Grotesque Part II that Karen Flores was in. She starred in all three of my Slime Creatures releases you might have seen.
The shylock's the good guy.
You wouldn't be talking to me if you were.
But you work for the casino?
So you don't work for the casino?
Because they're not the type of guys would take it with any degree of understanding or restraint. The first thing they'd do is break my legs.
Because I need half a million to buy a script.
"Mr. Lovejoy".
It's not bad when you know what it's about.
Martin Weir. He played the mob guy that turned snitch in "The Cyclone".
No, his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed Mt. Whitney.
He drown?
Let's see how we get along.
You're kidding, right?
I said I'd think about it. What does that mean? In this town, nothing.
His shrink's trainer.
I mean, at least Bo's invested in three of my movies.
Personally?
What Get Away jet?
Yeah, well, maybe the guy took out flight insurance. Check with the wife.
One of mine?
Like this?
I believe it.
I didn't know where else to keep it.  Where would you?
Sit down, Leo.
You see a black leather jacket, fingertip length, like the one Pacino wore in Serpico? You don't, you owe me three seventy-nine.
I know who he works for. Where's your phone.
How much is the wife offered?
I spent all day crawling out of a grave. The costumer kept bitching 'cause I was ripping my nylons –-
Yeah. When you turn to the camera to tell the alien mother that her time on earth is finished... when you give us all that look, Joan Crawford wishes on her best day she had that much presence. Not even in "Mildred Pierce" -– which by the way was a better book than a movie -– did Crawford even touch the intensity you had in that look.
I married Martin. That was a full- time job.
He must mean after "Slime Creature 3".
Yeah, well Martin is known for his flipping. He flips over a script, and when the time comes to make a deal, he flips out.
Right. See how your story ends.
For starters, Marty wasn't Martin back then.
You thought I was faking?
He's doing the same thing you did to him, playing Letterman on TV.
You bet.
You said don't say nothing and I didn't.
You gonna start that again? You're just like him, all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin' thing.
I'm going into the movie business.
I'm thinking about producing.
Whatta you mean, whose point of view; The audience's point of view.
You heard me, Pick 'n' Save.
Yeah, me too. He was a helluva good writer. And I would know. I discovered him. Made him what he was.
He's telling me an idea for a movie. It's not bad so far.  Sit down, have a drink.  Tell Karen, let's see what she thinks.
Yeah, that's what we need. More agents.
Once their lives are in danger and you have the mob guy coming after them, it not only heightens the tension, it adds a wistful element to their love.
Roger, Arctic Warrior. I say again, our records indicate the passenger vessel Chimera was lost at sea. Over.
Sixty pounds.
Morning, skipper.
We'll see who's dreamin', m'man.
She's so big somebody could come alongside her on the other side and we'd never know it.
Out here? What, so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of Spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now?
Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow.
So we kill him?
Why not?
What?
It's a risk I'm willing to take.
The damn thing's been floating around for God knows how long and it hasn't hit anything yet. So we take it easy. A little of the old push pull.
Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal.
Like I always say --
She take a radio?
Either way, they must've had a pretty good reason.
Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. We found her. She's ours.
We'll stand a watch. Four on, eight off. Low man first.
Fresh ain't the first word that comes to mind.
So whoever did this might still be around.
What is it?
Not me.
I don't know what you're talking about?
The radio. Oh, yeah, the radio.
I bet you did.
Probably didn't have time.
That's what I call a payday.
No.
Nothing. Let's get outa here.
Nope.
We don't exactly have the best bargaining position.
Dodge, get on that turbine. I don't care if you don't sleep for a week. The sooner you're done, the sooner we can get out of here. How's the food situation?
No cowboy shit. Right.
Yup.
Epps.
What?
Not our mystery guest again.
I don't know what else you'd call her. One second she was there, the next she was gone.
Showing you what?
Leave him till we can get some help.  From now on, nobody comes down here.
Maybe it was more than that.
I didn't want it to turn out this way.
What do you say, Dodge?
Alright. I'll be right up.
Sorry.
We leave it where it is. Stick to the plan.
Not much at all, I guess. Retire. Live out my golden years and all that.
Drink up then.
You've been out for about a day.
Dodge found you out cold in one of the cabins.
Alright. Everybody grab your gear! This' is where we get off!
A what?
Who?
I made spaghetti. Do you want some?
Tell her to forget it - I don't need her help.
I just buzzed him in.
Uh, no. I missed that one. But what do I know? I like Laurel and Hardy movies.
Dana! Hi!  Uh, Dana... this is Enid...
It's just that I feel like it's maybe not a good idea for us to keep going out.
It's supposed to be Don Knotts.
Well, no - it's more like a "found art object."
As far as I know it includes housing and meals and everything... it is really quite an offer...
What do you mean?
What? I'm just kidding around with the customers... It's my shtick!
Look, I already told you I'm not going to give you a ride.
No, I'm serious. Give us your whole basic philosophy in a nutshell.
Yeah, well... hi...
Why?
Are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms?
"Yeah, right"... well why not?  What's so wrong with me?
Why do you have that stupid poster?
It's totally sickening.  Let's see if they gave me the right diploma...
Why?
You loser.
This is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again...
Unless they're in your Summer school class!
I know, she needs to die immediately.
How perfect.
Soon... I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes.
We should follow them!
In fact, never.
Okay, well here's yours...  "Who said all the most eligible bachelors are taken? Not this one! Stunning bod, very snugglelicious ocean sunset dreamer."
We should call him and pretend to be the redhead.
You lent it to me in like tenth grade.
Which loser?
Oh yeah.
Why do I always have to do it?
I know, look at the way he drives... he's like an old man.
It's still twenty-five minutes early.
She says she wants to MMPH!
Gross!
As always.
Hey, you have to see my new good luck charm.
Forget it. I'm sure it sucks. All these movies suck.
We have to do something fun tonight this is my last weekend of freedom before I start my stupid job.
I don't believe you.
No way... when?
He does that every single day.
No, it doesn't. You'll see... you get totally sick of all the creeps and losers and weirdos.
Like what?
Yeah, right... Believe me, at this point I'm over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me!
I told you - my manager was a total asshole! Don't worry, I'm going to get another job... and anyway, I have some ideas for how to make money in the meantime...
Yeah, thanks.
I can't, it's Seymour's birthday...  Shit! What time is it?  I have to go to the store! I was going to make him a cake...
Yeah, I guess... call me...
God, you're really obsessed...
I thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex, and that he's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that...
No matter what happened it would be a big disaster... Let's just try and keep everything the way it is.
So should I come over?
I don't believe you.
I said "great"...
You're the one who's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy!
Yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing.
That's okay...
Him. Seymour. He's the man with the records.
Where did you get those pants?
Tell me what?
I know it's over, asshole, I --
God, fuck you!
So you really liked it? Yeah, there's some really rare performances. You liked that Memphis Minnie, huh?
The Skip James record? Yeah, that's a masterpiece. There are no other records like that! I actually have the original 78 of it in my collection. It's one of maybe five known copies.
NO!!!
Oh, right...
Jesus! That's very nice of you Enid but I - I really --
I'm just not one of those guys who has a "type"...
Well, let's see... I guess I'd have to put Traditional Jazz, Blues, and Ragtime music at the top of the list, then probably...
Oh my god! We have to go in here!
Fine, I'll go by myself then...
That thing is just so shrill and piercing and loud - it's like someone jabbing me in the face!  KFTO comin' atchya on this beautiful evening...
I brought it for him to autograph. He's going to be amazed to see it - it's one of two known copies... I can't believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner. What an insult!
Just wait here.
I told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label.
But it's not totally hopeless for you... I've had it. I don't even have the energy to try anymore.  You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything I do so you don't end up like me...
You work at Cook's Chicken?
No, in a lot of ways things are better now... I dunno... it's complicated. Everybody still hates each other, but they know how to hide it better, or something...
Oh... uh... It's just this elastic thing I have to wear for lumbar support...
Then again, that's easy for me to say, since I'll never even get a date. I'm sure you have hundreds of guys who are interested in you.
How can you be so sure?
Hi, it's me...
Really?
Aren't you even going to ask me how I'm doing?
I... I wish I could, Enid, but I really can't right now... I -- it's just that I --
In whatever way you think I mean.
I don't think you understand how I really feel about you, Seymour.
Can you at least let me in?
That's great! "Half-empty" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist!
I will if you want to.
I-I never expected anything like this to happen...
But, I...
Right.
Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.
Forget it, there's no way... find some other poor sucker to abuse.
Yeah.
It's my response to the issue of a woman's right to choose... it's something I feel super-strongly about.
Why wouldn't she tell me? There's no way! She could never keep that to herself... you're crazy.
Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological...
Don't thank me. You're doing all the work.
You don't know all that has happened here- the Devil has come to Tsavo.
Am I to take it you want to live?
Excellent decision.  Your name is Abdullah? I'm sure we'll meet again. Go and enjoy the splendid morning.
I'm sure you've examined my record. So you know I've never yet been late on a bridge.
How could it be? I hate Africa.
-not a time for modesty, Bob-
You don't enjoy killing, do you? 
-well, it's just...  ...other men don't abandon their wives at such a time-
What if there are complications?-
I am desperate to see Africa- but I hate the leaving.
He just gave me his "monster" speech.
The females are bigger- only animal here like that- have to be or they wouldn't survive because the males eat the young.
Beaumont says it's to end slavery.
Have you got that in writing? 
Does he speak English?
I've got medical supplies to deliver. Come along to the hospital when you're done. 
And anxious to get started.  What is this, mostly malaria?
Shhh.
Not to terrify you, Nigel, but it's worse than you think- I've never even seen one.
-true enough- but without the comedy relief. 
What did I do?
All right- let's go into battle.  I'm Redbeard. 
Have you ever failed?
You just got hit.  The getting up is up to you- but they're only lions-  -and I'm going after them crack of dawn... 
Yes. And I'll be in some distant tree where I can provide no assistance whatsoever.  Can you control your fear?
You think they'll come then?  Why?
Get on? They detest each other. Obviously the Africans hate the Indians. But the Indians also hate the other Indians. Some of them worship cows, while others eat them. 
I have to ask- why do you need me?
Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas. You?
Some mysteries should not have solutions.
I'm sorry.  Perhaps some other time.
Hello, Dana.  I happened to be in the neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to see if everything's all right with you -- you know, with the blackout and everything? Are you okay?  Is the baby all right?
Good night, Janosz.
I don't believe we have the luxury of choice.
We don't have a relationship.
Do you ever see him?
How is he these days?
Didn't I do it?
You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
Unusual?  I don't know.  I haven't had a lot of experience with babies.
You are personally responsible.  If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing?
Thanks.
I don't know what to do anymore.
Really?  And how would we handle the sleeping arrangements?
Now you get dressed and we go out.  I got a babysitter and everything.  Trust me, you need it.
For one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real?
Why do you say things like that?  You're so much better than you know.
Finally came to your senses, huh?
Now you're talking.
No, I celebrate at the beginning of my corporate tax year which is March first. That way I beat the crowds.
So they bartered room and board in exchange for housekeeping services, which was a good deal for all of them because then they didn't have to withhold tax and social security, which I'm not saying is right but it's just a story, so I guess it's all right.  I can finish this later if you're tired.
I don't think we should leave her alone.
Oh, yeah, sure -- no.  But there's really not much to do here and they might need some back-up at the museum.
Too bad for the Moldavians.
My pleasure.
We got a major creep alert and we're just going down the list.  Your name was first.
Not.  Don't leave town and report any change in your address to the proper authorities. We'll be back.
Yes, the scourge --
I await the word of Vigo.
Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets me up like that I can't resist.
You've got to stop them.  Please!
Yes.
I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I could lose my license.
Well, I think it's important for people to know that the world is in danger.
I predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.
This is not just some money-making scheme!  I didn't just make up the date.  I have a strong psychic belief that the world will end on New Year's Eve.
No, I guess I'm just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it.
They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland.
You might want to check those Duke University mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis.
This is about as deep as you can go under Manhattan without digging your own hole.
And we're the ...
This guy was a bad monkey.  He dabbled in all the Black Arts, and listen to this prophecy.  Just before his head died, his last words were, "Death is but a door, time is but a window.  I'll be back."
Butt out, you pencil-necked geek.  I've had it with you.
I can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. And there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you.  But there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg.  We just have to mobilize it.
Uh, I can't.  I'm kind of working on something.
Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
Dana!  Dana Barrett!
Hold on, Ray!  Half-price!  Have you gone crazy?
This is an incredible breakthrough, Venkman. A psychoreactive substance!  Whatever this is, it clearly responds to human emotional states.
Well, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say supportive, nurturing things --
Okay, but you're missing all the fun.
Are you kidding?  We'll hit all that bridge traffic at 59th.  I'm going to take 72nd straight up to Fifth.  Trust me, I used to drive a cab.
We're almost there, Lib.  Step on it.
It likes all the sappy stuff: 'Cumbaya,' 'Everything is Beautiful,' 'It's a Small World' -- but it loves Jackie Wilson.
Now if you don't want to be the --  -- fifth person ever to die in meta-shock from a planar rift, I suggest you get down behind that desk and don't move until we give you the signal "Stabilize -- All Clear."
Huh?  What?
What?  Yeah.
No, I'm fine.  I just got light-headed for a second there.  Let's go.
Right, and the first time someone gets mad, their toaster will eat their hand.
Wonder what?
Nice going, honey.  It was brand new.
To the bathroom, where do you think?
Oh, that's nice, Louis.  I'll stop by if I'm around.
Hi, Louis.
Really?  Do you have a favorite piece?
That's a violin concerto.
This is terrible.  Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.
Then leave.
Most people can't hear me with the whole orchestra playing.  You're good.
The "stiff?"  He happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world and a wonderful man.
Well, the name Zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 B.C. by the ... What's that say?
I am Zuul.  I am the Gatekeeper.
Okay, I'll help you.  Should we make some dip or something?
One thing at a time.  We don't even know what it is yet.
The EPA?  What's he want?
You could say that.
I'm not at liberty to say.
No, you may not.
Then my theory was correct.
The wet towels, residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair, the redness in your cheeks indicating ...
I'm always serious.
She's telling the truth -- or at least she thinks she is.
Yeah, I can smell it.
Does she want to be?
I'll spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning.
She said he was "the Destructor."
And look at this, Peter  Cold-riveted girders with selenium cores.
It looks like a big pair of breasts and a pot belly.
If anyone deserves it, it's Spengler and me. We're doing all the hard research and designing the equipment.
Ray, I apologize.  I guess my confidence in the Regents was misplaced.  They did this to Galileo, too.
Sit tight.  I'm on my way.
Don't move.  It won't hurt you.
It's not good, Pete.
What?  What popped in there?
The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man!  He was on all the packages we used to buy when I was a kid.  We used to roast Stay-Puft marshmallows at Camp Waconda!
Mmmhmmm.
And the seas would boil ...
Judgement Day ...
Every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world.
LATER, MAN!!
I was suddenly thinking about going to bed.
Why?  Then they'll notice when I'm gone.  Well.  I'm making a public appearance aren't I?
Commodus is heaving out every thing that belonged to our father.  Except that he can't heave out his ghost.
Not yet, dear brother...
Do you want posters, too?
If you set me free I will find my way back to the army, march on Rome and depose you.  Then, the army and I will restore the Republic so that animals like you will never control human destinies again.
Until your confirmation date.
I'm serious.
Make a gift to the people.  It's your money anyway so it's only fair.
I wouldn't know who to bet on.
I'm certain father will be in better humors by then.  Now, honor us with your presence at dinner.  I'll join you as soon as I see my father's physician.
Where is the emperor and the army, soldier?
He must have been.  He was on the list of prisoners to be executed.
Caesar, I did my best.  The Colosseum isn't under my control...
Yes, Caesar.
This is Cos, this precocious young man.  A scribe for the Daily Action.  I've invited him to write a small piece about you...
I'll nose around...
God of passages and changes?
You mean a symbol of someone who doesn't exist.
For the sake of the Gods, you're not leading these men?  How like my father you are.  You 'believe'... I guess that's why you're still alive.
"But what if I wish to be purple?"
He killed his father and then my family...
I will, Marcus.  But you're going to be well enough to direct it yourself.
You're too hard on him.  He is a strong young man, with you as his guide...
Marcus, you honor me, but I'm a soldier, politics scare the hell out of me.
Much more colorful than the ones we wear.  And, of course, less dented.
On your honor as a Roman officer, daddy?
Centurions on both sides of the river are convinced the Germans will try one last offensive.  They've got nothing to lose and it's so very like them.
I've been overseeing production myself for the past three years, you'll be surprised at how wonderful our oil has become.
Let him trust Quintus.
You teach them!
Chain him.
I'm not a gladiator.  I refuse to fight.
Alive... I'm alive...
On you!  Of course!  You are my bravest fighter -- the best fighter I have ever seen!
Oh, shit.  Take your time!  Don't get suckered!  This man is a murderer!  In his career he's killed over a thousand gladiators.  Please, just take the fall!
Fantastic!  Wonderful!  But posters are very expensive.
I want nothing to do with the arena.
Hello.
No.
No -- why should I?
But, Elaine --
This whole idea -- this date and everything. It was my parents' idea. They forced me into it.
Wait a minute.
Let's get out of here, Elaine. Let's go somewhere else.
I don't know. They must think I look like this guy Gladstone.
Yes.
You do?
That woman --
Here he comes.
I've got a real feeling that this is the fellow.
Because -- I am.
All right then! Yes!
All right -- but listen to me. What happened was there was this party at my parents. I drove your mother home -- then we went upstairs to see your portrait --
-- suddenly there she was without any clothes on -- I mean really naked --
If you want.
My belt.
I don't know. I don't know what's happening.
I'll think about it.
Tomorrow?
Benjamin -- I haven't even said I'll marry you yet.
Yes.
Well -- I'm just sort of traveling through.
What?
Oh -- no sir.
Who screamed?
All right, boys -- I think you can get back to your rooms. I don't think we'll have any more of this agitation. Will we, Braddock?
Because I don't like you.
-- and I was wondering if I could buy you a drink or something --
The Singleman party, sir?
What?
No.
Oh -- no. I'm just sort of disturbed about things.
Right.
What?
Why not?
When is he coming back?
What do you mean?
What?
Pardon?
Like what?
We'll forget it right now. Finish your drink.
Yes.
Benjamin?
I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.
Yes, I have --
Benjamin -- I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd --
Why is it?
Yes. Yes. Let me out!
Yes.
Nervous. Well, I am a bit nervous. I mean it's -- it's pretty hard to be suave when you're --
You? Oh no. No. I'll get it.
Why don't I get it? Well -- I will then.  If you'll excuse me.
That's fine.
Isn't there something you want to tell me?
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson. I think -- I think you're the most attractive of all my parents' friends. I just don't think we could possibly --
INADEQUATE!
Go ahead then.
No.
There's no risk?
What?
Thank you.
No we don't.
About five years.
On New Year's Eve. Sometimes on his birthday.
I never did, Benjamin. Now let's --
Think real hard, Benjamin.
Yes.
Why are you asking me all this?
We'd go to his car.
I don't think we were the first.
Don't talk about Elaine?
Benjamin, don't you ever take that girl out.
I was just kidding around.
Let's drop it.
Benjamin?
Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.
Well it's pretty obvious you don't want me around any more.
That's all right. I think I can understand why I'm disgusting to you.
Thank you.
Thank you.  Benjamin --
Benjamin -- I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.
Where is Elaine?
I think we have everything quite under control now, Benjamin. Would you like a quick drink before you go?
Sir?
Very good, sir.
No, I do. I want to tell you.
What else?
But I don't want you to make up something.
Goodnight, Benjamin.
Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --
About what?
You got me.
That has nothing to do with it --
No. She doesn't know about it.
No. Actually -- she doesn't know about us getting married yet.
Oh no.
I wish I was that age again. Because, Ben --
Quite a while.
I'd like to hear it.
I will.
What would you say to a short one? Bourbon still your drink?
Ben, I think we're two civilized human beings. Do you think it's necessary to threaten each other?
Well, I don't think we have a whole lot to say to each other, Ben. I do think you should know the consequences of what you've done. I do think you should know that my wife and I are getting a divorce soon.
No! No -- we're just on our way downstairs!
They are?  Come on.
I could take care of her.
Chloroform on a handkerchief from behind -- while you...
You're no good for this business. It's just a joke to you...
You can't.
How?
Who?
Would you like to make a man happy?
I feel sorry for him.
For tonight. 
And Baron, thanks so much for everything.
What do you want here?
Nerves -- just nerves. You must forgive me. I have had a bad evening. I am very tired. Do you know what it is to be tired -- tired of a routine existence?
And...?
A man who could love -- that is all, who has forgotten everything else for you.
You are beautiful!
I want to be alone.
I wanted money desperately -- Can you understand? -- That's why I wanted the pearls. I was threatened -- I was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money. I've been following you -- I've admired you. But I have forced myself not to think about you -- Last night, at last, I managed to came into your room and -- and now.
Yes.
Suzette will be back here in a minute.
Are you coming to the theatre? Oh -- I shall dance tonight -- How I shall dance -- I want to feel that you are in the theatre.
They've brought me such good luck -- you --
Oh -- here you are, Baron. A drink -- A Louisiana flip?
Absolutely true, Kringelein and I have to raise some money immediately.
You've lost everything?
Oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found it -- you found it for me, Baron.
How's the beautiful lady?
Please, Baron -- forgive me -- not now -- here she is.
No -- letters to two-eighty.
Man -- I was at the clinic the whole night -- there are no words to describe what my wife suffered.
Nobody, Doctor.
Yes -- Oh -- oh -- yes, -- 
More than fourteen thousand marks... were in that pocketbook.
Stay where you are.
Oh, don't go.
Yes -- it's stimulating -- a man might --
I'm happy, Miss Flaemm.
Quick -- something awful -- awful has happened. Go -- go at once, -- Mr. Preysing --
I'm the stenographer.
Moreover --
That'll be all -- be here tomorrow at nine o'clock. 
Well -- you want me?
Well?
A thousand marks -- 
You mean Baron von Gaigern?
Very simple -- I've always liked the way you dressed, Preysing -- English, isn't it?
They turn out marvelous material in Manchester.
We have a good many connections in England, naturally.
I'm laying before you the last general statement of our concern. Active capital, plant and machinery, raw material and finished product -- for instance -- mop rags --
Oh -- Preysing, Preysing --
Oh -- now let's talk like adults. You want to tell us now a along story of what your factory can do. We know all that you could tell us and if you tell the truth it wouldn't sound so good. When you first approached us...
Scratched --  We did not take the initiative.
And I said we didn't.
Under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.
I've admitted that at one time we had reason for desiring ther merger -- What reason have we now? The Preysing Company has fallon upon evil days, very evil days.
In that case give us the articles. We'll sign at once. We know all the details...
Send it away -- I shan't need it.
Goodnight, Suzette.
Where is Pimenov? Where is Pimenov? 
I'm cancelling the engagement.
The house is not full -- Is it really full?
Every seat for the opening has been sold at Vienna. Sold out for three days.
There was -- there was.
Yes, Pimenov.  One minute, Suzette, I will call you.
Well, now, that's very kind -- thanks. That's what I want -- a large room on the front with a private bath -- Yes, that's what I want. I can pay now if you like.
Some champagne, Miss Flaemm?
He tried to rob me -- he is dead --
You are late. Hurry.
Come, Lisaveta, he will be there -- he will be there.
Have I kept you waiting?
Everything depends on the Manchester merger.
I'll see you in the morning then, at the conference. Everything'll be all right, Preysing... Don't worry. Goodnight.
Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz -- I'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen -- will you clear up the situation?
Bluff -- Bluff -- all bluff.
That.
Let's go down and find her -- I need a drink -- Come along Zinnowitz.  I don't know anything about women -- been married for twenty-six years.
I'll loan you a raincoat.
Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I still gotta drive back up to Los Ang-gleez.
Or else he's working an angle. If he doesn't steal a little, he's steeling big.
Roy? He's always crying.
Mary Beth! This has never been anything but --
Oh, Henry, no, that's just boring.
Can't move.
Oh, Cole, please. Please come out of it. What would I do without you?
And I don't just mean the SEC. We could have the FBI breathing down our necks.
You know who I work for.
Maybe I'll swing around Los Ang gleez on the way.
Why? What's wrong?
You are seeing it. You're looking right at it.
That's just the first year. If you aren't worth a lot more than that the second year, I'll kick you out. What do you say?
No?
Perk.
Maybe I'm just not ready for that yet.
That's me. That's who I am. You were never cut out for the rackets, Roy, and if you --
I pay my debts.
I've really got to --
This way's perfect.
Don't be sorry. You're not taking it.
You must have some money.
You're smart, Lilly, and you're good-looking. You won't have any trouble finding a job.
I thought it over, and you were right. You wanted me out of the rackets, and now --
I thought you'd be happy for me. After all, you --
I know you do, so that's why --
My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting.
You're too young. You should be in school.
In your other hand.
Always, for you, baby.
Oh, I am, baby, believe me.
All? It ain't bad.
Oh, yeah?  Thanks.  How long do they say I'm in here?
I just do what the doctor says, babe.
Mama!
That's just Lilly's way.
Every day in every way.
Because it's comfortable.
We'll rent a car.
You ain't seen nothin.
You already went back to work.
I watched you. Working the tap on those soldier boys.
Myra, I'm not following this.
It is, Roy! And now, right now, it's the perfect time, the best time since I've been in the game.
Join up with you! I watched you, Roy, I've been watching you, wondering if I should talk about this at all, or maybe just... 
I need a partner, Roy. I need an inside man, and you're it. You could be as wonderful as Cole.
I saw her.
You and me, Roy. What a team we'll make. We think alike; we get along together. Once or twice a year we take some slob, the rest of the time we live like this. You won't regret this, Roy.
I called a fellow I know in Tulsa, the one who plays my chauffeur. There's a sucker there he says is made for us. And a boroker that just shut down, we can use their office, not change a thing! Now, I can scrape up ten grand without much trouble. That leaves fifteen or twenty for your end. We could start this weekend, get the sucker into position --
What?
Don't act so goddamned innocent! You and your own mother, gah! You like to go back where you been, huh?
I'm wise to you, I should have seen it before, you rotten son of a bitch. How is it, huh? How do you like --
I'm sorry, that's an unfortunate phrase, it slipped out, I'm, to tell you the truth, Mr. Dillon, this isn't an everyday occurrence around here.
Not many.
No question, huh?
They said on the phone you were assigned to the Meyers case.
Explaining the low height of the blood splatter on the curtains...
The door was open, so we let ourselves in.
... I think it would be best if you both left.
Better take 'em to Virgil's downtown.  We got a dead body in there.
Well, Eddie Catero didn't show up for work this morning... parents say he never came home last night. Car's still missing.
Doesn't look good.
Would somebody shut this guy up?
My blood pleasure.  You scared the hell out of me.
Checking out your place.
My office?
I took the padlock off your door. What more do you want?
Nothing.
Or what?  You're gonna shoot me?
I was trying to get away from someone.
Get on the bus.
John, you can't help her now.
That would work.
Why not?
Is that all you guys can think about?  Amy never came back last night.  Maybe she's in trouble.
You saw that Michael Meyers display.  You've got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that.
Looks great.  It does.
Oh, please... you get that out of a fortune cookie?
A box of fortune cookies... I'm running out of advice.
I'm fine.  I just need to lie down...
What?
Michael Meyers.
I can't believe this is happening.
We've got to get these kids out of here...
Can't you hold it?
You think they'll let him in dressed like that?
Linda, you are without a doubt the scariest person on campus.
Why?  You interested?
We were worried about you guys so we left early to see if you were --
Shit, Beth, why do we have to be the ones to organnize this friggin' fair? It's only Halloween.
Isn't he that psycho who's been spying on my sister?
Okay ... But just for tonight.
You can't expect us to stay here --
No one's coming to get you.  Not while I'm around.
You'll never pass that exam on an empty stomach, Kara.
What in God's name are you talking about, woman?  When are you gonna stop listening to those damned talk shows?
What makes you think he'll come here again?
Danny, go downstairs -- Now!
I didn't -- He got in a fight and I --
Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?
Wait a minute ...
That's the whole idea of living in the country.  I thrive on the seclusion.
An old friend.
Good.  I want around-the-clock surveillance on that house.
Sam, you know you never fail to amaze me.  Yesterday happily retired, today right back in the thick of things. Somehow I knew you still had it in you.
It was you.
Stay away, Sam.
Only me --  -- and Dr. Wynn.
Used to be against the law, didn't it?
Must have changed that law.
Looseleaf--will you get the hell home?
After eight years in the jungle with you, I know Mrs. Wheeler better than I know anybody in the universe!
The hell with the diamonds!
Take the Cadillac and drive it off a cliff, for all I care.
Go home.
When?
Sorry.
When I was a naive young recruit in Spain, I used to wonder why soldiers bayoneted oil paintings, shot the noses off of statues and defecated into grand pianos.  I now understand: It was to teach civilians the deepest sort of respect for men in uniform-- uncontrollable fear.  To our women.
It helped more than you know.  Down deep, people were deeply affected.
He's a man.  Tell him you're a man.
Sorry.  At least you've got a place to come back to.  I don't have a place to come back to anymore.
I dunno.
Everybody thinks that.
The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
I forget mine for years on end.
I just want one true adventure before I die.
For what?
We're ahead of schedule, that's all. You're finding out here what you would have found out in Africa-- that you are a rabbit, born to be eaten alive.
He can shoot!  He can hold his ground!  He can attack!  You're in your proper profession right now-- sucking up dirt for frumpish housewives, closet drunkards every one.
As a matter of fact--I am home.
Is anybody besides you here now?
I was going to a funny movie, but I changed my mind.  If you're depressed, laughing doesn't help much.  When did you know my father?
Everybody says he was so brave.
He worships Father.
They were in the same creative writing class.
What's good about that?
Dad was never in England?
"The sting."
I don't know.
Where did you get the poison?
When I grow up, I'm going to go to Mhravitch.
Sir?
Oh no, no, no, no, no.  It can't be. How embarrassing.
No, no, no, no, no.
I can't take my eyes off you.
Can't it keep till morning?
Couldn't you have vanished quietly out the back door?
Beat the shit out of someone who hates you.
No.
I'm talking to you gently now.
A springbok, an oryx, a gemsbok--a gazelle.
Raw hamburger, please--and a whole onion.  I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
How do you do, Mrs. Ryan?  I'd heard you were beautiful, and so you are.  Am I intruding here?
Give us time, Harold--to adjust to your being alive.
A telegram--a phone call might have helped.
Nothing would please me more.
I could carve a better man out of a banana!
He thought he could take my place. It is now my privilege to give an unambiguous account of why I don't think he's man enough to do that.
Mrs. Wheeler is dead.
You're wrong.
People don't use that word any more.
The whole concept of heroism--and its sexual roots.
I don't think so.
Because if you do--I'll leave you. HAROLD  Goodbye.
It isn't a matter of liking.  It's a matter of getting used to death-- as a perfectly natural thing. Would you mind leaving?  No woman ever walks out on Harold Ryan, and then comes back--for anything.
He's in East St. Louis with his mother--visiting an aunt.
Sounds quite beautiful.
Like what?
I plan to live one hundred years!
I feel mocked, insulted, with no sort of satisfaction in prospect. We don't have to fight with steel. I can fight with words.  I'm not an inarticulate ape, you know, who grabs a rock for want of a vocabulary.  Call him up in East St. Louis, Penelope.  Tell him to come here.
Ah!  The lady is armed.
You're--you're old friends of Harold Ryan?
Oh dear.
And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan?
And her fiancé!
A policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab.
Are--are you crying, Penelope?
Whose son this is, whose wife that is.  A fiancé is the most ridiculous appurtenance this household could have at this time.  Good night.
I know malaria.  Malaria isn't caused by the bites of bats.
Are you've seen it work cures?
You were wrong, you quack!
We'll find out now, won't we?
Yes--well--uh--that's another one of those statements which more or less automatically requires an apology.  Whenever you feel like it. It's sort of like turning off an alarm clock that's ringing loudly. Your apology turns off the alarm.
Comical?
I'm high as a kite.
You're a clown.  You're a clown who kills--but you're a clown.
Evolution has made you a clown-- with a cigar.  Simple butchers like you are obsolete!
If you're at home in the ooze, and nowhere else.
You're not such a creature of the ooze that you'd hurt an unarmed man.
In any event, I will not beg for mercy.
My violin is avenged!
More clowning!  Don't you see?
I'll put it in Paul's room, where it belongs.
You don't know?
So that's it! "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." Everybody was yelling "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." I thought it was some foreign language.
That's what he wanted--a ten-year- old wife.  He'd come home from a war or a safari, and he'd wind up talking to the little kids.
I heard you were looking for me.
Yes.
Do I have to?  Who's the little girl?
That is sad.
It's my father's birthday--that's all.  That's all.  Who cares about that?
I don't want to live any more.
He's coming back, Mom!  He's the bravest, most wonderful man who ever lived.
You're the only woman he ever took out.
Still lives with his mother.
How did she lose her feet?
I was afraid to ask.
I didn't know that.
No.
Father's friend.
Dr. Woodly?  You know who this is?
Maybe it's supposed to end now. Maybe God wouldn't have it any other way.
He's not anybody to tell somebody else what to do in a master bedroom.
I'm glad.
I know.
If you'll pardon the expression, that's when you'll see the fur and feathers fly.  Good night.
Far as I know.
You figure!
He said one other thing.  It wasn't very nice.
Throw out all this junk.  Burn it! This room crawls with tropical disease.
No doubt Paul thinks it stinks.
As long as he keeps out of the park.
The only thing I ever told him about life was, "Keep out of the park after the sun goes down."
It's suicide!
Meaning?
Why would you do that?
I'm amazed.
He'd go to a movie.  I think that's what he'd do.  If I were sure he was in a movie, I could stop worrying.  We could have him paged.
It's really that bad?
Oh--look at the poor, crucified violin, would you?
You fake!  You're no better than the dumbest general in the Pentagon.  You're not going to beat Harold. You're not going to beat anybody. You're not going to stay here, either--yammering and taunting until you're most gloriously killed. Go home!
I'm glad you brought your vacuum cleaner.
Not true.
We have enough for a shuffleboard team.  In Heaven, shuffleboard is everything.  Hitler plays shuffleboard.
Big threat. TV would ream you.
You're not Vice, are you?  Do you work for the Los Angeles Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
What do you want to tip me for? Look, you got to spell it out. Whatever you want, just say it.
Wait?
That's all you got, three girls?
I like it, Mr. Van Dorn.
Overpowering?
You kidding? Three days work. I finish tonight.
Well, next time you talk to him, tell him to pay his actresses more.
Sure. Like in Mikey and Niki. Did you see that picture?
Um-hm. Live sound.
Okay. My client pays for it anyway.
Tonight. When you get out, we'll go.  Why didn't you tell the other detective?
I am.
Yeah.  I'm her father.
At least I'm a growing person.
'Sucking off.'
Not very.
Tod was.  He was with Ratan.
He deals in pain.
No, please go on.
You really believe all that?
What makes you so sure?
...What do you have to offer?
And better?
No.
No.
They are?
Get out. Get out of here, Goddammit.
It's just a name.
Does she know anything about this?
They don't know. They were having some recreation deal out at Knott's Berry Farm and Kristen wasn't there when they got back to the bus and they couldn't find her.
Well...
What we got is just these here.  What you see.
They're all about the same. You want something?
What exactly do you have in mind?
...I'd just start my own business. That's what I did. Get into kid porn. That's big now. Why don't you come around the set? Meet some people. If you still want to invest, I'll ask around.
Okay. Keep in touch with my secretary.
Calm down, mister. You don't want to get the cops in here do you? You got a family?
I'm worried about Jake.
He didn't look good at all. Something strange is going on. He's got himself into some trouble. He wouldn't say what.
My name ain't Niki. It's Pattica, like in Attica.
Who's that?
You don't have to get uppity with me, Bill. I remember when you was running that car wash and couldn't make it go. And what was that other thing you tried? A Dairy Queen? Went busted too.
'Was.' He and that shitheel Ratan went down to T-J. Maybe I shouldn't say that. Anyway, I hear he's back in Frisco now.
How do you do. I'm Mrs. Chasen. Come in.
None of that, lady.
Possession of a stolen shovel.
Lady, resisting arrest is a serious criminal offense. Under the state criminal code, section 545, paragraph 10-B...
And that truck - is it registered in your name?
Wait here.
I'm in charge of all the invoices for the southwest. We supply, for example, most of the egg farmers in Southern California. So you can imagine.
I'm a file clerk.
And you get into any car you want and just drive off?
Thank you. But when you take these cars don't you think you are wronging the owners?
Oh, at the dentist's?
Really. Do you think it's wrong?
Subways... Perfume... Cigarette...  ... Cologne... Carpet... Chestnuts! ... <u>Snow!</u>
Certainly a new experience for me.
I don't know. Just one of those. 
But this is public property.
Look, the ice is melting.
Yes.
Why? There'll be a new block of ice in the morning.
Me!  When I look around me I know I know nothing. I remember though, once long ago in Persia, we met a wise man in the bazaar. He was a professional and used to sell his wisdom to anyone willing to pay. His specialty for tourists was a maxim engraved on the head of a pin. "The wisest," he said, "the truest, the most instructive words for all men at all times." Frederick bought one for me and back at the hotel I peered through a magnifying glass to read the words - "And this too shall pass away."  Well, the wise man was right - if you remember that, you can't help but live life fully.
What was that?
Well, don't go.
Traitor! Benedict Arnold! Remember Nathan Hale, right, sir?
Scared? Swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours. I was petrified.
Yes. They're old friends.
Here.
You've never cried before. I never thought you would. I thought, despite anything, you could always be happy.
Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.
What?
At a funeral.
Oh. Well, how do you spend your day?
I burnt down the Chemistry building.
Eh?
Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.
Harold! That's <u>disgusting</u>!
Oh yes. That's fine.
We've always been here.
Yes!
I'm your Daddy now, Kirsty.
Oh yeah? On your own a lot, Huh?
God, I wish I could say no. This is going to do terrible things to my attitude, you know.
The boxes! I TOLD you.
No. Don't let it. You've come this far.
You're in the Malahide Institute. It's a psychiatric hospital. But, hey, don't feel judged -- it was just the nearest place to bring you. Remember? You and your boyfriend...?
What are you talking about? Who are you?
Oh, pardon me. I obviously didn't convey my hesitation to take his story at face-value. No, YOU talk to me. But -- do me a favor? -- none of this DEMONS crap.
The mattress... The mattress... JULIA.
Story of my life.
Liz left us, Red. Take the hint.
No, listen this: Sammael, the desolate one, lord of the shadows, son of Nergal --
Didn't even buy me a drink.
Red -- you need to hear the rest of the information --
Skip to the end, willya?  How do I kill it -- ?
Amongst other things, yes -- but that's hardly the point.
Karl Ruprecht Kroenen, one of the Reich's top Scientists. Head of the Thule Occult Society.
There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight --
I thought you liked being on TV.
He's just going through a phase --
I know where to find him. I'll get him back.
Who wards off demons.
Oh, stop that --  Damn! Be careful, there --
1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.
Nah. I'll be around, Red, just back in the field.
Who?!
Yup. Sixty years old by our count. But he doesn't age like we do -- think dog years: He's barely out of his teens.
Noooo! Noooo!!!
I can live with that.
When we do: No mumbo-jumbo. Double- core Vulcan-65 grenades.
No one ever helps me. It's my job.
C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.
Hostage negotiations.
"Need" is a good, solid word.
Start in, you got nachos coming.
Good night.
He's just pushy.
A brute.
Don't know. Really. I grew up with him.  I've missed him too, but now, every time I see him, I get confused. Hardly a day goes by he's not in my mind. Even now, I feel he's here --
Coffee's warming me up.
What?
Oh, sod you.
Uh-huh.
To a man called Frank Cotton?
I have to speak to my father.
No.
What? What will you do? What CAN you do?  There's nothing to be frightened of.
Don't mourn him. He was dead long before we laid a finger on him.
Believe me. It's me. It's really me.
Hurting.
Good.
And you came back here to solve the puzzle --
There's very little I can do about it.
Hi. I got soaked.
Just an accident. He's all right. Will you drive? He needs stitches.
I have to see my father.
The best part of ten years.
I don't know. Probably wanted a hideaway.
We'll sell it. Sell everything.
You mean we're moving in?
Oh Christ. Julia...
I hear you.
Shit.
I'm going to throw up.
Are you O.K.?
Can I get you anything?
Fine.
Please...
Please. I can't bear it...
Just soda.
That depends.
Let's keep it that way, shall we?
No.
What's wrong?
No Dad.
I do. I'd just feel happier if you were with us.
Sure.
I love you, honey.
Maybe you should give it some time.
She's not like Mom. She's... I don't know... moody. I thought that was what you liked about her.
Really?
What?
Of course.
I want to see.
It's late.
If there's a train.
Yeah, there's room. And there's Julia.
Well you've just been talking to the wrong people.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have surprised you.
IT WON'T GO ANY LOUDER.
Yeah, well it's fucking Monday afternoon.  You should get out of bed earlier.
He offended me with his terrible taste.
I didn't know it was classified information.  I mean, I know we don't have any customers, but I thought that was a bad thing, not, like, a business strategy.
Oh no, Rob, that's not obvious enough. Not at all.  Dick, did you hear that?
Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
Let's pack it up.  We haven't had a customer in four hours.
What band?
You are not in a band, Barry.  You are not a musician.  And no posters.
That's why you got the gig, isn't it?
You're not even coming?
Whatever.  Okay. "Tell Laura I Love Her." That'd bring the house down. Laura's mom could sing it.
What?
I owe it to myself to go right to the edge, Rob, and this group does exactly that.  Over the edge, in fact.
They always seemed...
It's the new --
You can be and are wrong.
On Clark Street!
Anna who?  Anna Green Gables?  Anna Conda?
No.  No.  Mom wants you to come to the funeral.  It's on Friday.
Just that Rob seems to think it would be wiser to start a record label by putting out a record with business- crippling Nazi Youth shoplifters than with someone he knows in his bitter jealous heart is a musical visionary.  That's all.
I thought I would ask you a few questions if that's okay.
Oh, well, the Kinky Wizards are -- you know what?  Why don't I just make you a tape?
'Cause you like their second one, you said, Pop, Girls. etc.  The one with Cheryl Ladd on the cover.  You didn't see the cover though.
Yeah.  I'm sorry... Look Dick, Laura and I broke up.  She's gone.  And if we ever see Barry again maybe you can tell him that.
Yeah.
Liz, hold on a second --  What?
Do it.  Do it.
I am fine...  I gotta go.  Goodbye.
We've noticed and we're glad.  But, you know... how are we going to make peace here?  We want to make things easier for you.  What can we do? Obviously I know how special Laura is, and I know things can't be good for you at the moment.  I'd hate it if I lost her.  But I'd like to think that if she decided she didn't want to see me anymore, I'd respect that decision.  Do you see what I'm saying?
I dunno.
Yes.  Well, I'm coming over to your house to get some things.
It's not like saying that at all, actually, Rob.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye make pop records --
I remember the song.  I just couldn't remember who sang it.
Well, I liked you.  You were a deejay, and I thought you were hot, and I didn't have a boyfriend, and I wanted one.
Yeah, sure.  More so then than I am now.  That's life though, isn't it?
Just the obvious stuff.
I'm too tired for this now.  I know I'm asking a lot, but will you take off for a while so I can get my stuff packed up?  I need to be able to think while I do it and I can't think while you're here.
Is what better?  Better than what?
Well the answer is that I don't know either.  We haven't done it yet.
I guess.
Nothing.
I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are.  You're running.  On the run.  You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing "Doctor Who"-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. And with... him.
Jesus.  I do not know.  I'll talk to you later.
You don't ever think about other people?
Those aren't mine.
I'm sorry to go on about it.  But, I don't know, there's a lesson here somewhere, and I want to make sure you get it.
Well, think about it.
Pigsty.
I don't care.  As long as you don't expect me to hold your hand.
Mmnn.
I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.
Yes, of course.  There's nothing to worry about.
What's the difference?
Well I was gonna lie and now I can't, because you'd know I was lying.
You're being stupid.
At Paul and Miranda's.  Paul from work.
I tricked you into meeting some people you'd think were great.  I thought it would be fun to introduce you to someone with a Tina Turner album and then see whether you still felt the same way.
WHAT?
It's no joke.  I'm responsible for what happens, you know.  Embarrassment aside, there's a lot of money and effort in this, at least by my standards.  I have to put down a deposit for the room.  I have to pay the pressing plant for the records, sleeve them, sticker them --
I'm going to talk to you about whether you want to get married or not.  To me.
Are you persuadable?
I dunno.  Didn't think about it, really.  It was the asking that was the important thing.
Hey.  It's Liz.
Yeah.  Like I said, I don't want to take sides.  And I like Laura with you.  She's more fun, more open. You guys are good together.  I just wish you two could, I don't know.  I don't think much of this Ian guy --
It's a crematorium.
Good.
God, I hate that time.  That pick up stuff time.  I just went through that before I came here.  You know that song "Patsy Cline Times Two" I play?  That's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections.
No way!  I'd cramp his style.  And I wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall.  I'm way to unattached for that.
Nor have you!
I'm sure it isn't.
Oh, right.  Alright.
Hi, Rob.  It's your mother.
Your lucky Laura's doing so well. If it wasn't for her, I don't think either of us would ever sleep...
Well call her mother.
I'm going to drink this bottle of wine watch TV and go to bed.  Then tomorrow I'll get up and go to work.
Meet a nice girl and have children. I promise the next time we talk I'll have it all sorted out.
Then what are you getting so upset about?
I must have nothing.  Their my husband's.
That wasn't part of the deal.  I want to be poisonous but fair.
Suit yourself.  There are plenty of others who will.
Sixty.
And I won't take a penny over ninety.
I'm sorry but I think you better talk to someone else.
Nice.
Sure.
Why?
I've been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family might have had with museums or historical societies.
Church Hill, that's pretty close, isn't it?
Good day, Miss Cartwright.
Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright?
Probably.
I think you do.  Better yet, I don't think anything was stolen because nothing was there in the first place. And I think Mr. Smith, whoever he is, now knows that.
At the moment?  Carl Smith.
Not your concern.
He's dead.  Whatever I may or may not feel means exceedingly little to him now.
Go home.
Are you?
You had to do _nothing_!
You're a fool.
It's beautiful.
You are a very perceptive young woman.
You and your buddy make a real team, don't you?  Exchanging eloquent threats in iambic pen- tameter while hacking up all the innocents in between.
It's all the same.  Half lives that never go away.
Will I see you again?
No!
The inheritance.
I'm just curious.
What are you getting at, Moran?
It's bullshit.  Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to here with it.
Why?
What are you doing man?
You'll not be bringing the church into this.
You are the same?
Yes.  Always.
You will live.  Survive.
We are brothers.  And you are a defense-  -of sorts.
But why be so concerned about me?
And you?
So why the crazy talk?  It's a miracle it is.  Saint Andrew has smiled on me.  On us.
Who?
That's mad.  Surely you don't take their word?
Tradition.
Finish yours?
We have no understanding.
Who do you think I am?  One of your freckle faced children waiting to die tomorrow?  "Threaten you"?  You and I just living will always be a threat.  Forever.  Look at your life, Major.  Look at mine.  Nothing there but threat.  Threats and nothingness. It's what we live for.
You are really going to force this, aren't you?
Must he go?
Where did you learn that?
Figure she's with him?
Not yet.  Called FBI yesterday. Thompson's going to try CIA this afternoon.  Y'never know.
Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
We learned he'd found the immigration notaries in Liverpool and traced them to New York.  Then he figured out the birth records in Church Hill...
Good times then.  A man could stretch his legs without bring- ing half the world down around his ears.  Not like now.
You're insane.
I've had a few more concerns.
You're wrong.
MACLEOD!
This isn't done.  Get up.
I have waited forever for this. You will not cheapen it, little boy.
Are you here?
Yes.
I was walking by when I heard a shout.  Your men came right after.
I presume it's a sword.
I've got all the time in the world.  Except right now.  If you will excuse me, Lieutenant.
His only kid.
Hildy!
I should say not! That was one swell story you had in the paper this morning.
My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it.
You're so nice, Bruce, you think everybody else is.
That's what he did to me. Swept me right off my feet -- and left me lying on the floor.
He certainly -- hic -- does!
I know a lot of men who didn't do anything till they met Walter Burns. Please, dear.
Yes, wasn't it?
The Criminal Courts Building.
We'll explain the whole thing to them. 
You got it back, eh? There's something funny going on around here.
I've just told you I was busy with Mr. Bruce Baldwin!
Yes!

Mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at all.
Oh.
Well, er -- it looked a little cloudy this morning.
Yes, I know...  Hildy, will you ever forget the night you brought the Governor back to your hotel room and found me taking a bath? She didn't even know I was in town...
It's simple. A poor little dope who lost his job went berserk and shot a cop who was coming after him to quiet him down.
Thanks. I'll phone Hildy right away to get that story.
Thanks a lot.
Oh, sure.  Well, thanks for everything.
What the devil do you want? Listen, Bruce, you can't come in here now! We're busy!  Where you been, Duffy? Stick around! What? What Chinese earthquake? The deuce with it... what's that?
Come on, Hildy, we've got to keep going! Sorry, Bruce, but --
Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing?
You'll see nothing of the kind, Sheriff.
What did you say your name was -- Pinkus?
All I know is that instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my bridegroom, I spent two weeks in a coal mine with John Kruptzky -- age sixty-three -- getting food and air out of a tube! You don't deny that. Do you?
Just what I said. That's what I --
What's the matter?
No!
That's what I'm afraid of. "Any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
Get away, Svengali.
I'm not working for any other paper!
Get married all you want to, Hildy, but you can't quit the newspaper business.
He does, does he? How did I treat you -- like a water buffalo?
You're not afraid, are you?
So -- Sweeney gets twins -- and Earl Williams gets hanged tomorrow.
Especially with an election coming up in a few days.
You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose you examine Mr. Burns in his office. I'll get my bag and go over to the Press Room in the Criminal Courts Building. You phone me as soon as Mr. Burns has given you his check. Then I'll go get the interview and you phone Mother that we're taking the six o'clock train.  And no tricks, Walter!
Oh, nothing! Of course, you might cancel the check. Yes! Wait a minute! What would be his first payment on that policy?
It cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of Cooley.
Yes. Where is he?
That one -- how you gonna take him? They'll see him.
How much do you want on it?
Okay, Walter. 
What tickets?
What did you do with her?
That dumb immigrant'll flop on me. I know it.  Can you imagine Butch doing this to me -- at a time like this?
When I'm surrounded, with my back against the wall, you're not going to lay down on me, are you --
I don't care what you say. I'm going to find Bruce's mother.  Oh-h...  I'm going out and find her!
Murder, uh?
Remember the time we broke into the D.A.'s office, and copied Fifi Randell's diary?
In the Shoreland Hotel. And our only chaperon was the poor old lady's stomach.
Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter.
I don't know what to do, Walter.
All right.  Heads I go -- tails I stay to write the story. Ready?
Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for you!
Because I'm a newspaper woman, Heaven help me!
No, he won't. I wired him that I wasn't coming.
On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?
Well, maybe I'd like to know just once!
Well, I'd like to be lady-like and think it over.
Walter, you can't do that!
Take that mush out of your mouth!
What do you mean, I handed her? The patrol wagon was on the wrong side of the street.
I don't think she's talking much... You know what I mean?
Western an' Thirty-fourth.
Anybody with hair on his chest. Get 'em off the street -- anywhere. Offer them anything -- only get them.  We've got to get this desk out of here.
You're crazy. Where's Mac?
I think it is.
You said it!
Well, it wasn't exactly that way --
I know, I just want to give him a thrill.
It's easy for you to talk. You're retired. We're still working.
This Egelhoffer's pretty good.
Well, if she's gonna write fiction, there's nothing like being a reporter.
What's the use? I can't win a pot.
So long, Hildy.
Probably goin' out to get Williams.
Good coffee, isn't it?
Oh, that'll be all right, Hildy. Go ahead, run it. And you can say I treated him well, too.  'Lo, Earl. How are you feeling?
Four of Mr. Hartman's Deputy Sheriffs were rushed to the hospital --
Howard Shenken, the Sheriff's uncle on his mother's side --
That's good, because my health ain't what it used to be.
An attempt to ruin us!
Sssh. Wait, Fred.  What?... Where?... Where? Holy Moses!
Now what do you say?
What?
I was just going to!
Hildy, how'd you like a couple of tickets for the hanging?
Go on -- shoot me!
Now, Hildy, don't be hasty! I can't let him out.
Five hundred dollars.
Editorials?
What did you do with her?
-- You were with her. You were in the cab, weren't you?
All right, Judge.
What's the matter? Getting yellow?
Yeah. I was never so tired in my life.
Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
Oh, sure. The boss sent me over with it. Four hundred dollars, wasn't it?
That's good.
From all I can get the Sheriff let him out so's he could vote for him.
That man there!
Let 'em take me. It's better that way.
Ssh!
Get the Governor on the phone!
You can't bribe me!
I give that marriage six months.
Wants Hildy -- and sounds very excited.
Henry Chapman's daughter. It was Sheila. I remember her from last year.
I think you hit him, Grandpa. He was limping when he ran off.
I have to live in Rosehill Avenue as well.
You're much more convincing when you're making it up.
I don't mind.
It doesn't matter, I can drive the car home.
Could.
It's easy. I've done it.
Pauline.
It's dinner time. It really is. Cross my heart.
They've got the real thing outside.
The sodding water table.
It's like telling fibs.
They send over a few every day, to let them know we're still here. Each shell costs as much as a Ford 8.
We will, you will, for the rest of our lives?
Don't be so cheeky, Bruce.
Air-raid?
Thanks. I hope you can come for the launching.
What's left of him. He'll never see outside of the Star and Garter.
Kiss me Hardy.
If King and Country call, Mac, you go as soon as I will.
You need trees for an avenue.
And absent bridegrooms!
We didn't know that. It was a suicide mission. Machetes against artillery. Volunteers only.
Well, it's off ration. We know that.
You taste it.
That's it.
Play something, Grace.
Happy as can be. In the old groove.
Really, wow, so it's really a real thing.
Huh... what cone?
Oh yeah, the tree.
No. There's a bunch a us 'round somewhere... I think Mamma's sleepin'. She sleeps a lot, now... do you want marshmallows?
You sure do a lot of guessing.
Ain't the only thing tasty in this house. 
OK, sorry... maybe the Great Pumpkin ate 'em up.
Are you two gals all funny with each other?
You shouldn't a done that.
Yeah, I'll do something.
Holy crap, thanks!
Hey, wait take this.
Hell, boy there some other Duke you know about?  A great American.
Yeah but, she reminds me of this chick that I remember from fourth grade... called a... shit, what did we call her?  Oh yeah, Patty Pee-pee Pants... when ever she got called on by Miss Chumski, this chick would piss in her pants and start bawling.
So, the guy goes to Hell and the devil says, "do you smoke?" The guy say, "yeah"... the devil say, "great cause Tuesday is cigar night, sweetest Cuban cigars you ever had."
OK, Boss.
What's that?
Oh yeah, I heard about that. I always thought it was bullshit.
I'll help ya.
Lock the fucking doors.
Alright, alright. I know... I wanted to be the photographer.
It's a girl.
We can't leave her out here in the rain... maybe we can just drop her at the next rest area.
What?
What!
Quiet.
You seen this girl? Say... within the last 24 hours.
And I gave 'em directions out there, up by the old farm row... I figured what's the harm. Stupid kids probably going out to piss up a rope and got themselves turned around backasswards and got lost as shit.
Had to take him to the hospital. Kid had Dr. Zaius stuck half way up his butt, couldn't get it out.
Can I get some stamps off ya?  Did you fix the toilet yet?
Oh yeah, murder museum... sounds fun.
Hey, listen to this... I think this is related to our Dr. Satan.
Yes, thank you. Thank you very much.
I don't know, I think he's funny.
I know, but we can make it out of here. We can do it.
That's not me. I didn't... I'm not doing that.
No, nothing like that... yeah, we're gonna be a little late. We stopped for gas at this place called Capt. Spaulding's outside of Ruggsville and it turned into a whole thing, so we're kind of behind schedule.
Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap.
Aw, shit...  I gotta pee anyway.
Yeah, hey how far do you think we are from your Dad's?
A vehicle registered to a William S. Hudley.
You find something, Georgie?
Yes, sir.
Firefly.
What!
Enough with the stupid voices.
I know the words... fucking psycho fucking bullshit, that's the words.
Negative. Shit, we are so deep in the sticks we could walk for hours and find zero.
No, just a little too old.
Well, Bill... he's a good guy, he's been great help to me... a real blessing... I couldn't have asked for a better specimen. I mean you don't know what a dry spell I've had, total block...  ...total block... but Bill he's OK.
This can't be real, this can't be real, this can't be real.
Excuse me, I'm sorry for disturbing you this fine afternoon.
My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to ask you a few questions.
I um... no, I don't think so...
Who's your Daddy!
George Willis...  ...any leads?
Fit the profile?
I always favored the Hulk.
Aw, fuck.
We found one.
No "buts." Go to your room now.
It's embarrassing, okay?
How is that helping, Natalie? How exactly?
French?
Oui, doctor, oui.
Merci. I... Do you... would you like to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps?
Our...? Oh!  He seems fine. I guess we woke him. The lights and all.
I shouldn't say this, but you're pretty, Gabrielle. It's unprofessional, I know.
Really? No. Not at all. You're a very pretty girl. You should know that. You should be confident.
Unnhh.
Urgh.
You heard me! You make me sick when you pretend to not understand what I am saying to you! Go away from here!
God, you're beautiful.
I'm... I'm going to leave Lila. I can't stop thinking about you.
Terrific. We're all going to be rich and famous.
That's Lila?
Where do we look for little lost Puff?
Please let me go with you.
We bury the body. We disappear into the woods. Nobody knows.
Then I'll live for both of us, Lila. I'll be the most free, truest animal in the whole forest. For both of us.
Shut up and tell me.
Loves animals? Ouch. Must love animals, Rose.
God, he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff.
Lila, it's Rosie.
Please, honey, let me in.
Yeah, although I'm not going to turn him in. I like hearing the dirt.
Oh, Rosie.
With pleasure.
Oh, Rosie.
You are a therapist, right?
I hope you don't perform any of those dreadful torture experiments, Nathan.
My God! The fork! The fork!
No biggie.
Nathan!
Do you?
That's very funny.
A deer?
He looks perfectly fine.
Look at him. He doesn't understand English. He moves like an animal.
Your entire body?
Good. Making progress.
Of course not.
Sure. Of course.
Cruddy, okay? Are you satisfied?
I guess.
How come?
Thank you very much for that.
Lila...
Lila, you don't intend to hurt us, do you?
Ugnh.
Ooka.
Now, Puff, we're leaving on the electronic collar. I don't think we'll need to shock you, but just in case.
Got it.
here, here.
Well, it seems that since Lila broached the subject of children, you've been on edge and I know you have an issue with the, uh, body hair.
Yes, I suppose so. I suppose I knew that was going to be what you would say. It's good to see you again though.
I'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something.
What did he say?
Sit down.
What is?
To do what?
That's a -- that's a pretty big slice. Who do you think you are, General Motors?
You think I can lose?
Why back me then? Why not back yourself? Go find yourself a big fat poker game and get rich. You know all the angles.
Yeah, you already told me that. You cut that slice down to bite-size and maybe we can talk.
There are places. I'll scuffle around.
You know everybody, don't you?
Maybe you oughta give me lessons.
Where do I sign?
Miss Packard. How do you do?
What? And he -- he hustles pool?
I said we're leavin'.
No, it don't have to be fifty. It can be thirty... twenty-five.
Aaaahhhh!
What's your game? What do you shoot?
Look, friend, I'm not trying to hustle. I don't never hustle people that walk into poolrooms with leather satchels. Don't try to hustle me.
Want some free advice?
Comes right in this poolroom every night, eight o'clock on the nose. Just stay where you are. He'll find you.
I couldn't, huh? Okay. Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before.
Fast and loose, man.
Get with what?
What are ya, chicken, Charlie?
I'll connect. I'll get you your money back.
What for? To play Fats again?
You wanna come back on the road with me, okay, the money's yours. But if you wanna give it to Minnesota Fats... nothing doing. What do you say?
Well, hello. Haven't seen you in a long time.
I'm having some people over for drinks right after the races. Why don't you all come over? Then about nine, ten o'clock we can play.
I don't play pool, Mr. Felson. I play billiards. My house, my game. You don't have to play if you don't want to.
Oh no, nothing for me.
Okay?
Ah, that's unfortunate, Mr. Felson.
Yeah, sure has.
Oh yeah, yeah. You're tired.  And beat.
Let's cut out the small stuff, huh? Hundred dollar freeze-out. Ten games, ten bucks a game, winner take all. And then we'll see who quits.
Call it.
I don't rattle, kid. But just for that I'm gonna beat you flat.
Since four.
Eight o'clock.
No, not always.
I used to be an actress.
I like it to be what it is. It's Sarah. That's a biblical name. You want to know its meaning?
No.
I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.
You told me.
Thanks.
Museums... art galleries... concerts.
Take your choice. I've got enough so we won't have to go out of the house till Tuesday.
When you've got money, you'll pay.
The bills are right here. You didn't say what you wanted.
You'll find yourself another rich old lover.
Is that what makes a winner?
Does it bother you? What he said?
More like a week. Look, I'll be back.
He went off someplace.
Yes sir, boy, they, heh, they say that old Fats just shoots the eyes right off them balls.
California. Oakland.
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of straight pool.
Preacher, gimme my coat, will ya?
Listen to me, my blood somehow... helped you.  It could help all of you.  We could find some way to --
Yes.
Dark and large.  With vines -- no, not vines.  Not alive.
Yes.
Have you looked inside?
What's inside?
He wanted me to see -- he thinks I was -- infected by you.
I'll go.  We'll both go.  Far away.
Stay alive.
Well, it's not supposed to be done anyway.
Please.
That's the Air Force Base.
If we want it, it is.
It's that time of year again. We should get a pretty good show out here.
That's Mars.  The closest planet to us, now.  That's why it's more than just a point in the sky.
Okay.
You've got to come see -- a big thing went down over the hill!
I don't know, Dad.  But it was big.
Sure ... fine.
Was there anything over the hill?
What, Jim, what?
That's a doozy of a dream, son.
It was all made of stuff that's happened to you in the last few days.  The sand pit in back of the house, and the meteor shower, and meeting your teacher and the colonel at school, and being afraid of the new kids because you don't know them ...
That's Ed.  Ed works with the Bell Telephone switching division.
Yes -- but ...
It's his nightmare.  He still hasn't gotten over it ... about the other side of the hill.
May I ask why?
You people have a lot of nerve, taking it on yourselves to encourage young children to speak out of turn. I'm of a mind to pull him out of school if this is your idea of how to handle ... What sort of training do you have anyway?
I don't have many friends.  Dad's all the time moving.
She said the frog came from around the Copper Ridge.  She must've been behind the hill.
I'd believe him.
Yes.  I can even read star maps.
I know a way.
No, Mom.  It wasn't a plane.
What?
What kind, Mom?
Gardner?  Oh, um -- he's a new student. Just moved here.  Why?
You have to leave the White House.
You don't understand. You have to leave Washington.
It's not paranoia. The embedding is very subtle. It's probably been overlooked...
Walk to the window. Right in front of you.
I want you to leave with us. Right now.
My ex-husband works in satellite communications.
He used to run the NASA. He knows where all the bones are buried. Comes in handy.
...and we'll be the only guys in town with a clear picture? That's my man.
Can you believe this?
Remember I told you that the signal hidden within our satellite signal is slowly recycling down to extinction.
I'm thinking.
They don't know this.
Moishe, please, don't talk.
What was it, Roswell? You had the space ship, the bodies, everything locked up in a bunker, the what is it, Area fifty one. That's it! Area fifty one. You knew and you didn't do nothing!
What'd I say?
I want you should know, I'm very proud of you, son.
It's not me. They're overriding the system.
But Mr. President...
I think our secret is out. They're headed right for us.
Roger.
Well, er... it's slowing down.
You know me...
Don't get premature on me, Jimmy. We don't light up 'til the Fat Lady sings.
We're already over Mach 2!
I'm bringing home the bacon. Earning my keep. And doing a fine job if I do say so myself.
We must maintain a working government in a time of crisis...
These three died in the crash. Their bodies are as frail as our own. You just have to get past their technology, which is, I'm sorry to say, far more advanced.
Papers, sir. Got it here.
You've got it!
It's today's mail. And it's been opened.
What is it?
It looks like a converted church.
Marcus, get hold of Sallah. Tell him to meet you in Iskenderun.
It's... a leap of faith. Oh, God.
Arghhh! Oh!
No, Henry. Try not to talk.
I'd rather spit in your face. But as I haven't got any spit...
Don't take that tone with me, my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries.
You've got the wrong Jones, Mister Donovan. Why don't you try my father?
As what? A Nazi stooge like you?
Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
It's a rubbing Dad made of the Grail Tablet.
Where is it? I want it.
All I have to do is scream.
Out!
And the head.  You hit me, Dad!
Well, I am sorry about your head, though. But I thought you were one of them.
Good point.
I got it and I used it. We found the entrance to the catacombs.
Well, uh...
She talks in her sleep.
So did I.
What???
I'm out, Dad!
What?
What final challenge?
Booby traps?
But what are they? Can't you remember?
Two selfless martyrs. Jesus Christ!
Fly... yes. Land... no.
This could be close.
I can get it -- I can almost reach it, Dad.
I'm not exactly... a knight. What do you mean?
Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
Just a routine inspection tour.
You think so?
This is a different situation, Dr. Jones. These people are like children. We have to lead them slowly into the twentieth century.
Even if they were trying to scare us away, a devout Hindu would never touch meat.  Makes you wonder what these people are...
Did you discover anything in that tunnel, Dr. Jones?
No -- you can't go! Something awful's happened. They've got Short Round and I think Indy's been --
We found a tunnel that leads to a temple below the palace! Please, come with me, I'll show you!
I remember first hearing your name when I was studying at Oxford. I am Chattar Lal, Prime Minister for His Highness the Maharajah of Pankot.
And didn't the Sultan of Madagascar threaten to cut your head off if you ever returned to his country?
I don't like to show off.
Sure, I found him. Then last night I had a little trouble. Somebody tried to slit my throat.
Just a statue.
Yeah, that's what happened...
Why?
What?
That's what you've got these children -- these slaves digging for?
Nobody can say you don't have a vivid imagination.
Who cares? Where's that diamond!
He told me they knew I was coming here.
Stark naked? You wish... If you're trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones, this is a very primitive approach.
What?!
PET IT??!!
I know the feeling...
He said he couldn't take us any farther. He has to go sell the elephants.
You want me so bad, why don't you invite me?
Don't catch cold.
What -- the bug?
I'm coming, what's the rush?! Ohh! What's that?! There's stuff all over the floor! I can't see a thing!
A what?!
No... the heart's still beating!
Quiet!
You've got to go to sleep now.
Yes, they believe you.
There's got to be another way out.
What above the curves?!
Yeah -- this time you're gonna help!
And they don't even know what it really is.
You got it!
What for?
You're not gonna believe this...
Don't do that.
Me.
Yes.
Right.
What are you doing in my head, Al?
Kill myself.
Hear voices don't I.
Yeah.
With a man in my head...
Outrun them.
Can't see a Goddamn thi..
Go out, take your first left.
What do you mean?
Don't know.
I'm at the airport.
What about it?
How else do you get seaweed under your nails?
Just get there.
Why not?
Where are you going? Wait!
What? What do you mean?
What was?
Follow it.
You're out of shape.
You want sophistication, it don't come cheap.
You have no taste.
Pan the group, will you. If you're right, at least one of them...is involved.
...I've lost something. I must get it back.
How do you know?
Your data must be bad. Everyone can't be lying all the time.
Why don't you get out of my face.
You think. That's what you're good at.
You were with GRUNER!
Then why let her out of our sight? Besides, she's all we've got...
Come on.
Not sure at all.
You said 100,000 yen for the right Sony Walkman.
Well...?
And Dieter?
Just fine. I'll do the driving from now on.
And don't let her know, either.
Well, don't let it. What are you doing?
Where've you been?
Looks like you can have all you want.
Now, you're too suspicious.
I was wrong. She tried to help us get away.
You've changed your mind.
I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done.
Sending what we know back to U.S.T. via satellite.
JOE It's not love. It's like. It's real strong like. And I got your information. Now, get off my back!
Let us get to the border!
Trouble...is, if we both get stuck here.
Rene?
I'll prove it. We'll repeat their procedures...put a man in our POD, bring it down, and then...inject him.
We don't even know where to start. What about these people? What do we do with them?
Doesn't matter. Then put him away.
We met on the beach.
Yes. Joe.
What about it?
What things?
What?
Nothing.
...I'm looking for someone.
Oh...I can't. Business.
I just work for the travel firm.
Me still. They left you alone?
...Naw. Made that up.
No one. No one at all. I'm unemployed. Who do you?
Hires you for what?
How often they come here?
Wanted to get to know you.
What do you mean?
There's not much to tell.
Sometimes. I told you I did.
Last night?
Food doesn't agree with me.
Get your things.
They'd never talk in front of me. They'd walk away up the beach. Nervous about something.
Must be a pick-up, a rendezvous.
We figure out if it's in here.
I said just relax. I'm in full control.
This going to work?
He's Dutch. You can't even speak Dutch.
I can't fly it.
They asked about you.
Why not, what are you going to do?
Her?
Why are you on to him?
...Mr. Athol will be with you as soon as possible. Will you be able to wait?
It is?
Ahhh...Okay?!!!
Thank you.
Perfectly.
It doesn't hurt.
So we better get started.
Ms. Laufer gave me a star today.
For reading.
I heard them.
Yes, baby?
What? Forget it.
It's drawn from a selectively circulated...
Get me Wigand.
Maybe later.
No, I'm questioning your hearing! You hear "reasonable" and "tortious interference." I hear... "Potential Brown & Williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of CBS to Westinghouse." I hear... "Shut the segment down. Cut Wigand loose. Obey orders. And fuck off...!" That's what I hear.
I am? You pay me to go get guys like Wigand, to draw him out. To get him to trust us, to get him to go on television. I do. I deliver him. He sits. He talks. He violates his own fucking confidentiality agreement. And he's only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue, maybe the biggest, most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case in U.S. history. And Jeffrey Wigand, who's out on a limb, does he go on television and tell the truth? Yes. Is it newsworthy? Yes. Are we gonna air it? Of course not. Why? Because he's not telling the truth? No. Because he is telling the truth. That's why we're not going to air it. And the more truth he tells, the worse it gets!
End up in a high-profile lawsuit with Lowell, the First Amendment martyr? I don't think so.  Take a look at this... This is a summary of a dossier that's being prepared.
What does it look like I'm doing? I'm editing.
No, you fucked you! Don't invert stuff! Big Tobacco tried to smear Wigand; you bought it. The Wall Street Journal, here, not exactly a bastion of anti-capitalist sentiment, refutes Big Tobacco's smear campaign as the lowest form of character assassination! And now, even now, when every word of what Wigand has said on our show is printed, the entire deposition of his testimony in a court of law in the State of Mississippi, the cat totally out of the bag, you're still standing here debating! Don, what the hell else... do you need?
You alright, Mr. Wigand?
They own the information he's disclosing. The truer it is, the greater the damage to them. If he lied, he didn't disclose their information. And the damages are smaller.
You're getting ahead of yourself. We're all in this together. We're all CBS. We'll find out soon. Thank you, gentlemen.
Catch you later.
Jim, it's Lowell.
I didn't want to leave it there...
I got fired this morning... Where else am I gonna take it?
Thomas Sandefur...
No, thank you.
Where should I wash them?
It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City...
...it's anonymous. References to "P.M."  It's got to be Philip Morris, huh?
They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone.
I'm alone on this...
So, it's a big country with a free press. You can go work somewhere else.
No. No, it's okay... How's -- how's the new place?
You're not even on this anymore... What do you care?
What chance is there of getting Jeff's interview on the air...?
What's this?
Do you think we could talk about the taping? Tomorrow's taping, just so we can get it out of the way and order...
These people are putting our whole reason for doing what we do... on the line!
But in all that time, Mike, did you ever get off a plane, walk into a room, and find that a source for a story changed his mind? Lost his heart? Walked out on us? Not one fucking time! You want to know why?
What I've seen... I've liked.
That's room service. They usually knock first.  Come on in... Over here, please.
Black, black...
Just so I know you know, when I talk to people in confidence, it stays that way.
That, you have to discuss with CBS Business Affairs. But, for something like this, I would say anywhere between 10, 12 thousand.
Jump in, quick, c'mon...
To straighten something out with you. Right here. Right now.
Like what?
The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... they got up in front of Congress that time... it was on television...
Makes you feel good? Putting what you know to use?
You charge by the hour?
Well, my father left us when I was five-years old. He was not the most ingenious man I ever knew... Let's get back to Brown & Williamson. If you decide to go on "60 Minutes," I got to know everything about why you got fired.
You believe that because you get information out to people... something happens?
I know. I'm going to go there tonight...
I don't know what to do.
ABC...?
A can opener! A $39.95 can opener. I canceled payment... It was junk.  You ever bounce a check, Lowell? You ever look at another woman's tits? You ever cheat a little on your taxes?  Whose life, if you look at it under a microscope, doesn't have any flaws...?
Jeffrey, where you going with this? So where you goin'?  You are important to a lot of people, Jeffrey. You think about that. You think about them.
Yeah. Yeah, I will.
No, no. Don't call the police!  Just tell him I'm on the phone with you... My name is Lowell Bergman... Just tell him that.
What?
I can't say that!
What do you mean followed you? Did you call the police?
Someone put a bullet in my mailbox.
Then hold it off the air until you got that. But I want to go to New York. And I want to go on the record. Right now!
...I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured himself because I watched those testimonies very carefully.
Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly misstated, at least within Brown & Williamson's representation, clearly misstated... what is common language within the company... we are in the nicotine delivery business.
You're gonna get your fix...
It acts as a drug on the body?
There an echo in here? Your objection's been recorded. She typed it into her little machine over there. It's on the record. So now I'll proceed with my deposition of my witness. Does it act as a drug?
I'd rather play than talk about it.  What did you want to see me about? I don't like being back here.
...we worked together for, what was it, three years...? Now, the work we did here is confidential, not for public scrutiny... any more than are one's family matters...
Well, I wouldn't say --
He --
I told you we know each other, baby. Mr. Massey represented my ex-brother- in law. Martin Reiser?
Yep. My divorce just came through. Shoulda called you. Coulda cut a better deal! My wife still has health insurance and gets to see the children. But, I don't know. Guess I'm just a softie. After all Amanda and me were together for -- what -- you'd know better than me, Marylin. She was your best friend.
Who's the pigeon?
Who do you want me to kill?
No. You have the ring. Wrigley has the pre-nup.
Marvin says that Rex's will is four years old. He never redrafted it.
In the Godfather, after the courtroom scene, Frankie Pentangeli opens his veins in the bathtub.
I'll be right back.
Positano is beautiful. Remember when we were there, Rex? We stayed in the Santo Pietro? That hotel on the cliff?
Did you see the tape?
But you don't agree?
I know you do.
You don't believe in it.
And you've always loved him?
To him? He's a sick freak.
Miles. Miles. Miles.
It was his idea. It was a gesture of love and trust. Be happy for me, Miles.
Have you tried the duck?
Although knowing you as I do -- there will be no settlement. This time it will be complete and total annihilation.
I live right near there. The 800 Block of Maple. Come here. Marylin -- come here right now before -- just come here.
No. Don't stop.
Me. Yes.
And your mother was very beautiful. She must be proud of you.
She didn't love you?
No.
Huh?
Do you want me to sleep on it?
I know.
Well, I suppose I could "girly" it up for you with a little Fortuny, and some passementerie --
Miles.
I love you. I want to have your baby.
On the contrary. We're married and we have no pre-nup, so a case could be made that everything in here is mine.
Are you threatening me, because I'm sure that's a violation of the terms of your bail.
That's blackmail.
Marylin?
You have to leave the house immediately!
Please! Leave the house.
Marylin!
Marylin?
Sometimes I forget.
Thank you, Mrs. Rexroth.
Please!
You used his credit card.
Quite a little shopping spree. How do you spend six figures in less than six hours? Oh, never mind I've seen it before. I've seen everything.
She did a Harriman.
Of Massey Myerson?
Now? She's a night manager at McDonalds.
We do have a man for you.
He's not what I expected. He's very -- he's so -- happy.
He tricked you. With a phony wife and a fake pre-nup. Howard Doyle. He got you. You married Marylin, didn't you? You thought she had money. HA HA HA. Howard Doyle made you think that because of what you did to me. And to Marylin Rexroth. Yeah. I heard all about it. My brother Howard Doyle got you.  Neener neener neener.
Please! No calls! I'm feeling very fragile.
Oh, just a routine mammogram. She said to say hello. She's going to Positano with your brother's family.
My client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice.
Mm.
No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of it out there.
I'm not sure.
That's the problem. I can't afford to give her anything.
She always looked out for me.
She brought my digestive enzymes.
Maybe I should reconsider my...
I can't help it. Even with the business we're in, I -- it gets me every time. It's so -- optimistic.
HA!
Should we counsel fear -- or trust? Should we seek to destroy -- or to build? Should we meet our clients' problems with cynicism -- or with love?
We don't have much of a relationship anymore. I haven't seen her since before she married Rex. We had some very nice times prior to that. We were quite close.
Of course. Of course she was married. What else would she be? Single? I don't think so.
Who's "Patty."
Muriel Rumsey.
A guy that'd fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined.
In that event, we won't need so many supplies.
Never mind—I'll get it myself.  Gigolo? Why, you took the word right out of my mouth. Thanks.
Oh, hello, Dad.
Sorry. Must have been day-dreaming. 
It'll do no good.  He despises me.
It's no use, Dad. I practically threw myself at him. 
Why? Do you know him? 
I'm sorry you read it.
Someday perhaps, you might even take charge.
Thanks.
Oh, I see, young people in love are never hungry.
You win!
Yeah?
Yeah. I knew you'd catch on eventually.
That cadaverous-looking yegg who sat in front of us, just up and took it. Boy, how that baby can run!
You can wire home for some money when we get to Jacksonville.
I'll report it to the driver. About your bag, I mean.
Will you please tell me what you're raving about!
Forget it. I didn't do it for you. His voice got on my nerves.
Shut up!
Oh, I forgot to tell you. I registered as Mr. and Mrs. 
Yeah. Yeah, not bad. How's your's?
Well, thank you. Thank you very much, but— you've been very kind. 
What is it?  Why, it's a toothbrush! Thanks.  You—you had it pressed.
Outside!
Hurry up and get dressed.
If you didn't waste so much time on that wise-cracking drummer—we'd have been through with breakfast by this time.
Egg. One egg—doughnuts—black coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints?
I'd have gotten you some cream but it meant buying a whole pint.
You weren't so bad yourself.
Why, haven't you—?
Never! I'll get to New York if I have to starve all the way.
You're prejudiced.
Hitch-hiking.
No. But I've got a penknife. 
Needn't rub it in.  What're you eating?
You're an expert, I suppose.
What for?
Why not? I'm hungry.
Okay.  Cottage Number Three.
Maybe.  Sure—sure, I've thought about it. Who hasn't? If I ever met the right sort of a girl, I'd—  Yeah, but where you going to find her—somebody that's real—somebody that's alive? They don't come that way any more.
I would. But I've got a weak stomach.
You can't be hungry and scared at the same time.
Yep! The Walls of Jericho. 
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.  Here.
Serves you right. Oughta be careful who you take up with on the road. You can't go plyin' your trade in my camp.
Just your imagination.
How'd you like to be married to a wild cat like that?
That was free verse, you gashouse palooka!
You mean about the Andrews' kid?
To tear down the Walls of Jericho.
Wait a minute, Joe. Use your bean. I couldn't afford to hand you a phoney yarn, like that. I'd be crazy. There isn't a newspaper in the country'd give me a job after that! I could go to jail!
Yeah.
Okay, pete. 
He looked like an upright young feller to me, Ma.
Worst comes to the worst, we got his car for security.
Yeah, you'll have to git .
Zeke.  Git!
Why—no—
You can trust me, Mister. I'll keep my mouth shut.
Orange, New Jersey.
Yeah. Just babies.
Oh, gee, Mister—you wouldn't—you ain't thinkin' about—
When you're in a war, boss, you use every weapon you got.
Well, what do you expect from a pig but a grunt.
You can't ever say crime don't pay in Louisiana, Jim - only not as good as it used to.  Good chowder, ain't it?
You knew you weren't talking to some low life fag, you know.  He had command of the king's English.
Always - like tits on a pig.  I wish I had a million of those bimbettes.
Chief, maybe you had a little too much to drink.
Yes, but we're talking about a dead warehouse employee of no political significance.  Three years later and he's still classified?  They gave us his grammar school records, a study of his pubic hairs... Put it in context, Bill, of what we know about Oswald.  Lonely kid, no father, unstable childhood, high school dropout - wants to grow up and be a spy, joins the Marines at 17.  He learns Russian, he acts overtly Marxist with two other marines, but he's stationed at a top secret base in Japan where U2 spy flights over Russia originate.  He's discharged from the Marines supposedly because his mother's sick.  He stays home 3 days, then with a $1500 ticket from a $203 bank account, he goes to Moscow...
Hey, where y'at, Frank?  You're wasting your time here.  Big Jim gave strict orders.  No FBI allowed.
Yeah, I guess you do.
I'm just an investigator, Bill.  I leave the theories to you lawyers.
Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw?  The guy who used to run the International Trade Mart?
Yeah.  Clay.  I met him sometime in June of '62 at the Masquerade Bar. Dave Ferrie took me there, for the express reason to meet him.
No, you're awake, Bill, and I'm dead serious.  And we're going to start by tracking down your anonymous source from three years ago.  How did you find out Dave Ferrie drove to Texas that day?
It went to the goddamn FBI and they didn't find a goddamn thing.  It comes back a week later and one guy in the Dallas police department suddenly finds a palm print which for all I know he could've taken off Oswald at the morgue.  There's no chain of evidence, Bill.  And what about the tow guns actually seen in the Depository?  One an Enfield photographed by a newsman and the other a Mauser, described by Deputy Weitzman... Maybe, just maybe, Lee Oswald was exactly what he said he was Bill - "a patsy".  Take it at face value.  Lou, Susie, I'm going with my gut here.  He's got an alias of Hidell to buy the rifle, "O.H. Lee" to rent the room, right?  What's in a name, right?  In intelligence, they're assumed to be fake.  A name is sort of like a postbox number, a code - several different people can use the same name, right?  Then why can't somebody be using Oswald's name?
To frame him, obviously.  You got to get in your minds how the hell spooks think, Bill!  They're not ordinary crooks.
There's a word - orders.
He'd die pretty quick, either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.
Not in a routine autopsy, but if we looked at the spinal fluid, there might be a high level of iodine, but it's difficult to know.  Whatcha thinkin', Jim?
If it's a suicide, I seen weirder, Jim. 
No, I would not even know what he looked like except for the pictures I've been shown.
I don't have much time.  They don't even need bugs anymore.  They got these fuckin' satellite waves.  They put a bug in a friend of mine when he was born, right up his nostrils, subcutaneous, between his eyes.  He was one of those products of a crossbreading experiment.  A Nazi rocket scientist father and a Commie spy mother.  You'd never believe half the shit the Agency does.  I'm so fuckin' tired.  Haven't slept since that shit article came out. Why'd you guys have to go and get me involved with this?
Why Galveston?
Did you bag any geese on this trip?
I see.  Dave thank you for your time.  I'm sorry it has to end inconveniently for you, but I'm going to have you detained for further questioning by the FBI.
Would you say this "Leon" was actually Lee Harvey Oswald?
Everybody!  The Agency.  The Mob. The Cubans.  Yeah, follow the Cubans. Check them out.  Here, in Dallas, Miami.  Check out a guy named Eladio del Valle.  My paymaster when I flew missions into Cuba - he's somewhere in Miami.  You're on the right track.
Same one.  I didn't know no impersonator.
Black, black - just give it to me.  Shit.  I'm so exhausted.  My neck is killing me.  I've got cancer.  Had it for years.  I been working with mice, y'know, trying to come up with a cure.
Oh man, why don't you stop.  This is too fuckin' big for you!  Who did Kennedy?  It's a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma.  Even the shooters don't fuckin' know!  Don't you get it yet?  I can't be talking like this.  They're gonna kill me. I'm gonna die!  I don't know what happened.  All I wanted in the world was to be a Catholic priest - live in a monastery, study ancient Latin manuscripts, pray, serve God.  But I had this one terrible, fatal weakness.  They defrocked me.  And then I started to lose everything.
Dave, it's going to be okay.  Just talk to us on the record and we'll protect you.  I guarantee it.
Get some rest, Dave, and you'll feel better in the morning.  We'll talk then.
If that's your case, you didn't have a case.  I wouldn't believe whatever Habighorst said, anyway.
Sure it is.  Freckle Face, if I ever handled a minor felon like that, it'd be all over the papers.  I'd catch hell.  And this is the alleged murderer of the President?
That's something, Jasper.  What is it?
No, Jasper, nobody's gonna kill us.
The truth is that I heard between four and six shots.  I'm not going to lie for you.
No.  I had guns all my life.  I used to go turtle shooting.
So off the record, he starts talking about my family, and even mentioned my marriage was in trouble like I didn't know it or something.  He got angrier and angrier and then:
I knew something was crooked as a dog's hind leg, 'cause no one who is just taking a deposition gets that involved and angry... sure enough, when I finally read my testimony as published by the Warren Commission, it was a fabrication from start to finish.
That's impossible.  You heard echoes ...echoes.  We have three bullets and three shots which came from the Book Depository and that's all we're willing to say.
No, I saw a guy shooting from over there.  He was behind that fence. What are you going to do about it?
The FBI finally gets around to talking to him in Dallas and runs a file on him as a miscreant Communist type.
Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming back to George Washington's cabinet.
Goddamn!  They put Oswald together from Day One!  Like some dummy corporation in the Bahamas - you just move him around a board.  Sent him to Russia, in and out, no passport problems.  You got the word "microdots" in his notebook, you got the Minox camera and the electronic devices they find in his possessions, the sealed DIZ201 personnel file. For all we know, there could be a dozen Oswalds in different cities, countries - all of them leaving a trail of incriminating evidence that could easily be traced to a scapegoat after the assassination.  Does the real Oswald know he's been put together?  Who knows.  It doesn't matter, does it?  He's a low level spy, he doesn't know who he really works for...
I know.
Pffft!  Absolute nonsense.  The Quarter is filled with vivid imaginations, my dear Mr. Garrison - grimy young hoodlums who'll say and do anything.  As you well know.
Mr. Garrison, you're reaching.  I am an international businessman.  The Trade Mart which I founded is America's commercial pipeline to Latin America.  I trade everywhere. I am accused, as are all businessmen, of all things.  I somehow go about my business, make money, help society the best I can and try to promote free trade in this world.
Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man, it's difficult to accept this.
Well maybe you're right, Jim.  I'll give you one hour to solve the case... until the kids are in bed.  Then you're mine and Mr. Kennedy can wait 'til morning.  Come on, everybody say goodnight to Daddy.
And then this Colonel tries to make it sound like nothing.  Oswald did badly on the test, he says.  "He only had two more Russian words right than wrong."  Ha!  That's like me saying Touchdown here...  ...is not very intelligent because I beat him three games out of five the last time we played chess.
It'll be off the record, honey. I'll bring him in on a Sunday.  A quiet little chat between gentlemen.
Look at the calendar, for Christ's sake.  You said a Sunday, not Easter Sunday.
I don't know what to tell them.  How 'bout the truth - I'm doing my job to make sure they can grow up in a country where justice won't be an arcane, vanished idea they read about in history books, like the dinosaurs or the lost continent of Atlantis.
Your daughter's life was just threatened!
Our home, Jim!  A kidnapper, a murderer, who knows!
You and your government!  What's the matter with you?  Don't you have any feelings?  Your daughter!  What kind of man are you?
Jim, before this Kennedy thing, nothing mattered to you in this life more than your children.  The other night Jasper tried to show you a drawing.  You didn't even notice he was there.  He came to me bawling his little eyes out.  Jim, he's sensitive - he needs more from you.
I never doubted for a second that I was.  Will you come to the trial, Elizabeth?
No word yet.  But they think it's in the head.
Upstairs.  In 1963 that was the Office of Naval Intelligence - And just by coincidence, Banister, before he was FBI, was ONI.  What do they say?
I'd say the opposite - hypertension.
Who?
Allen Dulles?
Well, if that's what you want to call it.  I didn't ever think it would come to this.  I guess I am, boss.
That's exactly my question, Jerry. Maybe I'd better show you some pictures so you can begin to understand what I am talking about.
Kings are killed, Mr. Garrison. Politics is power, nothing more. But don't believe me.  Don't trust me.  Do your own work, your own thinking.
I think it started in the wind. Money - arms, big oil, Pentagon people, contractors, bankers, politicians like L.B.J. were committed to a war in Southeast Asia.  As early as '61 they knew Kennedy was going to change things... He was not going to war in Southeast Asia.  Who knows? Probably some boardroom or lunchroom somewhere - Houston, New York - hell, maybe Bonn, Germany... who knows, it's international now.
Any chance of one of them confessing someday?
...and your General?
His name?
Never touched me.
Well, I guess now that Guy's dead, it don't really matter... it was about the people hanging around the office that summer.  I wasn't really part of the operation, you know.  I was handling the private-eye work for Guy when that came in - not much did - but that's why I was there... it was a nuthouse.  There were all these Cubans coming and going.  They all looked alike to me.
Was he there often?
We can use all the support we can get.  I think these might interest you.
I imagine because this is the Criminal District Court Building  This is an enlargement of a potential shooter standing behind the picket fence.  We...
Mr. Ruby, I really can't see why you can't tell us now.
I went. I did. I took my mother and little brother.
Then say "Yes, Max. I understand."
I'll call her.
I won't forget.
Who was there for your ass?
Three years.
That looks like fifty thousand dollars from here.
Can she afford a good one is the question. Otherwise she'll be in Sybill Brand three weeks easy before the Public Defender gets around to her.
Hey, Jackie.
She wants to make a deal.
Sure.
Arrest me.
While you're at it, let me see what else is in there. You mind?
What's her name?
Okay.
Who do you think I am?
I thought you might want a drink?
It's kind of a sports bar
Was she helpful?
Shit.
Who gave me the money and who I was giving it to. And some guy they found in a trunk with his head blown off. Said it was him who told them 'bout me.
That's him. How do you know 'em?
Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
It was the other guy who busted me.
He's got that kinda money?
Cash poor?
Well, Jackie, you got caught, you're gonna have to give 'em something.
I felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in jail.
Sure.
Are you?
What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.
He called you?
Same way I been doin', but first they got to let me go back to work.
I ain't goin' to jail, and I ain't doin' that probation thing again.
You're not old. You look great.
It's not really something I think about.
Bigger?
I just feel like I'm always starting over. You said how many bonds you wrote?
I go back to work tomorrow.
He always just picked it up at my place. But with A.T.F. involved, I want to stage it. You know, make it look more intriguing, like we know what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T.F. guy to follow the shopping bag.
Right around here, in the food court.
Yeah, we were goin' over everything. That's why all the bags.
No harm in that. He's a young guy havin' fun being a cop. I know the type, trust me on this. He's more interested in Ordell than the money. If he's gonna do anything suspect, it'll be cutting corners to get the conviction; but he wouldn't walk off with the money. It's evidence.
If I saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money, would I take it?
When did you decide?
More or less.
Which one?
It may be evidence once they get their hands on it, but right now it's only money.
Do you think they bought it?
Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
On the phone I told him I have the ten thousand he put up for your bond. I could bring the money and the papers for him to sign. Walk out and call the Sheriff's department.
So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet?
We get Ordell to come to my office. Nicolet -- is he already there, or does he come busting in while we're chatting?
Thanks, but you have a good time.
You know what's in the bag you're taking?
You planted that shit on me.
Can I smoke?
I need it tomorrow. If I don't show up for work tomorrow, I'm fired.
He told me. Besides, why else would an A.T.F. man be after him?
A Broadway shopping bag.
You two meet?
His full name is Louis Gara. He just got out from serving four years in Susanville.
Was she there?
If I did, I'd have to give you one, wouldn't I? Or we could take what we want. No one knows how much there is except us, right?
Yeah, well, it's not a point of view that A.T.F. shares. Once we make it evidence, it belongs to us. You are now officially out of trouble. Don't do nothing stupid, now.
You didn't. I would think with all this on your mind, you'd wait till after.
Gimme one anyway.
This time? Almost a year. I've known him forever.
Dreaming.
Hi, Melanie.
I was expecting you. Come in.
Who you think got your ass outta jail?
Hey, you get caught with blow, that's your business.
I knew it.
I didn't tell 'em anything.
Go sit over in that chair.
The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that?
Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You.
Naw, naw, that's too much exposure. I ain't goin anywhere near that money.
Yeah, I think a woman.
I'll give ya ten.
What'd you care?
I ain't gonna send no roc whore. The woman's cool, I promise.
She don't know shit about the money.
Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit?
Four days ago.
Two months shy of four years.
Yeah, there's another hit left.
I was pretty much the same height now as I was then.
Yeah.
So what are you trying to tell me? I should get out of here?
Just stay right fuckin' here, all right?
Then what?
Oh, I dunno. Watching TV.
You're outside?
C'mon in.
She one of the women I got set up. I got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent Simone a small house in Compton, and about four blocks away I got me this nineteen-year-old country girl named Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot, country as a chicken coop. Took her to my house in Compton, told her it was Hollywood.
Well, why the fuck keep her around?
Hang it up, she's on her way. You gotta listen to this. This involves you.
You said five hundred and fifty!
The fitting room. It went down exactly the way it was supposed to.
Maybe the Feds got it.
What?
Why should I think anything's weird, if I don't know nothin' about them knowing each other?
Watcha gonna see?
He's a big one. You two tight?
You have cash. What do you need me for?
Fella named Beaumont. They have him up at county. It started out drunk driving, but they wrote it up "possession of a concealed weapon." Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.
They ran his name and got a hit. He's been in before.
She is an airline stewardess. Got caught coming back from Mexico with some blow. They set her bond this afternoon at ten thousand. Now, what I was thinkin', you could use the ten thousand you owe me from Beaumont and move it over on to the stewardess.
They fuckin' wit' her. They callin' it Possession with Intent. A black woman in her forties gets busted with less than two ounces on her, they call that shit Intent. Same shit happened to a movie star. It's Possession.
Was she?
Cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are. You got stewardesses bringing you fifty grand.
You want me to speculate on what you do. I'd say you're in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction. Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so more power to you. Okay you want another bond, and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on Beaumont to the stewardess. That means paperwork. I have to get a death certificate, present it to the court, fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral, then type up another application. An indemnity agreement --
Looky here, I know you helped her and I know you know what I want. Jackie can tell me any story come in that pretty head of hers. Long as at the end of that story, she hands over my money. She do that, we're still friends. Now, she don't wanna be my friend no more, tell her to think about ol' Louis. And if she tries to turn me in, I'll name her ass as my accessory. We'll go upstate together. Hand in handcuffed hand. Now that shit's a promise, understand what I'm sayin'? You tell her that, and I'll call you back.
No.
We been shoppin'. Can't have my boy running around lookin' like a bum on the street.
Not if your ambition is to get high and watch TV.
I was gonna tell you...
He leave town?
No! That was years ago! I've lived years since then.
Just to see you. That's all.
How do you know?
You know, I've been to three shrinks and a hypnotist. Nothing penetrates that night. Nothing.
Stop!!!!
What do you want from me?
Frank. It's Jake. Jacob SInger.
That's right. We did.
Gabe?  What are you doing ... ?
Tell your mother.
Now what?
This isn't injustice, Mr. Geary. The army did something to us and we've got to find out what.
You need ... a doctor.
War games? Thailand? That's not true! How can you believe that? Can't you see what they're doing? It's all a lie. We were in Da Nang, for God's sake. You've got to believe me.
Okay, not you Rod. But the rest of us are flipping out for some goddamn reason. They're tryin' to kill us. Fuck it man, we need to find out what's going on.
What can I tell you?
Her knee acting up?
I thought you said she didn't say much.
Yeah. You. Every time I see you. No more Errol Flynn, okay? Your back won't take it. You tell your girl friend to calm down if she knows what's good for you.
I doubt it's my mind that interests her. I tell you Prof, she's a fiery lady.
See them?  What do you mean? Physically?
I see them, Prof. Everywhere. They're invading my life.
I don't know what to say.
Whataya mean, no record?
It's freezing.
I don't want to know.
Go to sleep.
No. Don't move me.
Where is the lamp?
Where to?
Don't ask.
Your kid dropped it off.
No. The little one.
I don't let anybody call me that.
Just gettin' rid of the garbage.
They're like demons, Jez.
Show me Della!
It's gone to the top.
What kind of man are you?
Lie down!
You are the most unbelievable woman I have ever met. One second you're a screaming banshee and the next you're Florence Nightingale. Who are you? That's what I want to know. Will the real Jezzie Pipkin please stand up.
You wanna know? Turn on the T.V. Watch the fucking news!
I can do anything I want.
I have no idea.  I was right. There were experiments. I knew it. I knew it. My God.
I tell you, it was so wonderful. I felt like a little boy. I saw Paradise, Jezzie.
Sit down.
Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
YOU KNOW WHO I AM.
Hold me, Jezzie. Hold me.
Mid-town mostly.
Don't be funny.
Don't play games with me. There's nothing more to say.
Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
A couple of days later. It was fierce. You guys never saw it.
Yeah. But not with the Cong.
Hey, I'm not the problem. You've got bigger problems than me.
Just relax.
Glorious. I'm not surprised. I fed you enough of that stuff to send a horse to heaven. I'm just glad you came back.
I'm sure. You've got nothing but troubles waitin' for you here.
No. I couldn't.
They're awfully heavy.
Total delirium.
Help me!
Last night! They were as real as you are!
Nothin' much.
No joke. Fuckin' army! That goddamn war. I'm still fightin' it.
That black car?
They keep telling me I'm already dead, that they're gonna tear me apart, piece by piece, and throw me into the fire.  I carry these everywhere but they don't help. Nothing helps. Everyone thinks I'm crazy. My mother filed a report with the army.
How did it happen?
Punk?
You got lucky.
Pause play.
Yeah yeah I better call the labs, see what the hell is going on.
We're not leaving Crutch!
Then break it! If you don't pull it, the ship's going to depressurize!
No.
Done?
Explosive. We're blowing the walkway.
Rizzo did.
He came for me, I had to run!
Then you better hurry. I'll blow alley one, Delongpre, you and Rizzo take there. Janessa you ready two and we'll meet up there.
Bring 'em all. Let's move!
You tell me! She's only set one charge. And it's not finished!
And now we're all out of it.
wHAT'S My status?! I've lost three men and your worthless fuck! After I kill this asshole I'm coming your Yllo!
Roger that.  Time to kick some ass!
400 years in the future and these pea-shooters are the best you can do?!
It's better this way. If we were rescued Jason would just get off the ship. You want him on your precious Earth II?
I thought you meant...
Were you close to your father?
You?
Oh sure, all the time.
Okay, good tip.
Old woman?
She needs a little time.
Maybe we should go with them. Like you said, your Space Lab connections can deal with this thing. At least we'll be safe.
Well, do something!
You lost the charge?
I'll need the sergeant's okay on that.
That ought'a help the situation.
You're leaving me here alone?
Oh my God! Adrienne?
You need to get laid!
Don't worry about me. I live for this shit.
A real mamma's boy that one. Dissed his mamma and he nearly threw a tantrum. Little good it did him.
No! He's coming with us!
Keep trying!
What?!!
Obviously so.
Of course he is. He's the most relevant find in 400 years...except for you, of course. Look if you're worried about PR don't be. You're walking and talking.  He's a stiff. You'll get the publicity.
Why don't you get it? He's going to kill us all!
Scientists. Very intellegent men.
You're crazy!
Three...two...one...
Rizzo, a shuttle out in the middle of space? We'll die oout there.
Dad, the ponds are for old ladies.
I'm authorized by the township of Amity to hire you as an independent contractor. We'll meet your price. $10,000.
You got it.
Two cases. And dinner when you land.
What do you mean 'We...?'
Don't tell me my business!  Quarter-mile, that way. Full throttle.
Shut up! Just pump her out!
Have to pump her steady, s'all.
In Amity, you say 'Yahd.' 
Like you're from N'Yawk. 
Oh, yeah.  How do I look? Older, huh?
Here? You gotta be kiddin'.
I don't know if I can do that without a...
Maybe we can save August...
No, we just checked the beach...
About half of them. A lot of 'missing swimmers' are really shark victims.
Rogue?
What stinks so bad?
Chum?
Be careful, for chrissake.
You're situation here suggests that a Great White has staked out a claim in the waters around Amity Island, and that he will continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water.
A shark's attack is stimulated by the kind of splashing and activity that occurs whenever humans go swimming -- you can't avoid it!
Out there is a Perfect Engine, an Eating Machine that is a miracle of evolution -- it swims and eats and that's all. Look at that! Those proportions are correct.  I know sharks.
It's a whale out there.
Worthingsly... Worthington -- no one ever died on me before.
I didn't know her.
Oh, no, sir. I've never had a woman do that. I'm sure she drowned.
A thousand apiece, something like that. There's five of us. And we each kick in a hundred a week for beer and cleaning, stuff like that.
Looks more like the readers of the National Enquirer.
Doctor, you're the one who told me what it was!
So would I. Come on in.
Is anyone having this...?
I wouldn't put it that way. But I love sharks.
Martin hates boats. Hates the water. On the ferry to the mainland, he sits in the car the whole way over. He's got this childhood thing, there's a clinical word for it.
This is Quint, Missus.
He's busy.
We had a shark attack at South Chop this morning, Mayor. Fatal. Gotta batten down the beach.
It ain't a Big Mac.  The expert don't approve. What do you thing? You're closer to the situation. 
Look -- you may be a big Yahoo in the lab, but out here you're just supercargo, and you'll do as I say, or you can take your gear and backstroke home. Now get down here!
I don't think so.
Cool.
My mom uses color-safe bleach.
I'll see you at school, O.K.?
But you copy my work every week.
I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table.
Or something.
The guy is super cool! His name is Mark and he's into old horror movies and he plays guitar. I actually hung out with him today.
Well, I do.
Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go.
What about Katrina De Voort? You could go out with Katrina De Voort.
I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great mood. Despite the fact that I'm trapped in a fat suit I can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday...
Not this time. You don't have any reason to be mad at me. You broke my heart. I should be royally ticked at you, man. I should be really cheesed off. I shouldn't want to talk to you anymore.
Oh my God, SHUT UP!
No, for real. I think you are the coolest person I've ever met. And you don't even have to try.
Basically, I'm completely smitten with you, and I don't care if I'm making an ass out of myself right now, because you've seen me make an ass out of myself a million times, and you still want to be my friend.
That's all I need from you. That's more than I could ever ask for. You're just golden, dude.
The pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me. So why can't you forgive me? I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
I don't really know anything about it.
I can't grow a moustache. It never comes in evenly.
Well, there we have it. Would you like to know the sex?
No... I guess not.
Oh God yeah. But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.
But I'm going to give it up for adoption. I already found the perfect people.
They said they wanted to know about this stuff. They said to keep them updated, so I did!
Listen, Bren-duhhh, I think you're the one overstepping boundaries. You're acting like you're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else. Besides, who cares if he's married? I can have friends who are married.
You don't know anything about me!
Oh. Uh, my stepmom took me to the doctor yesterday and they said I was twelve weeks.
No Josh, I don't take orders. Not from you and not from any man.
Geeeerta Rauuuss!
Well, I just have the baby and give it to you, right?
No, more commercial stuff.
That's what you think. I drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuter-babies that's born without junk.
You know... it's parts...
Yeah?
Hey, I like this.
Oh yeah. It's Herschel Gordon Lewis. He's the ultimate master of horror.
Here's to dovetailing interests.
God, pretentious much? I guess everyone should have a mysterious name like Juno, huh?
Why? What the big deal?
Consider it your musical education.
Okay, stop surfing porn and get back to work. Just wanted to say hi.
Is Vanessa here?
Hilarious. No, I just keep all of my old comics down here, and I want to show you one of them.
Isn't that great? I got it when I was in Japan with my band. She reminds me of you.
What?
I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. I wanted everything to be perfect. Not shitty and broken like everyone else's family. Listen, once I have the baby, Vanessa is going to finally be happy, and everything will be all right. Believe me on this one!
But you're old!
I don't know. I just liked being your friend. I sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life.
No, not yet. I tried to work on it a little last night, but I'm having trouble concentrating.
No thanks. I'm off pills.
Really? Fingernails?
Vanessa, right?
Sure.
A Maker's Mark, please. Up.
Yeah, apparently. I'm having it on May 4.
Well, you're lucky it's not you.
Room with a toilet, got it.
So, then, you really think you're going to go ahead with this?
Nothing...
What do you mean? You mean...  Do you think I'm going to flake out on you?
Just, you know, shopping with my girlfriends.
No thank you. I'm off sex.
My dad used to be in the Army, but now he's just your average HVAC specialist. He and my mom got divorced when I was five. She lives on a Havasu reservation in Arizona...
No, it's not. Paulie is virile, by the way. He was very good in... chair.
No, but you know Bren. She dreams big.
Think you can narrow it down for me.
You mean like couples?
Either I just pissed my pants or...
Unfortunately, yes.
Eh, I'll call them myself. But I do need your help with something very urgent.
That is sick, man.
There are ads? For parents?
Come on, Leah. I can't scope out wannabe parents in the Penny Saver! That's tacky. That's like buying clothes at the Pump n' Munch.
Yeah, but it sucks for free.
There's a guy in here who's giving away a piano. Free for the hauling! We should put it in Bleeker's yard.
Yeesh, they sound like a cult. Besides, they're greedy bitches. They already have three kids!
Hey, I'm a sacred vessel. All you've got in your belly is Taco Bell!
Keith's hot.
There's no way in hell they're having sex or even holding hands.
I'm not jealous, and I don't care. I just know he doesn't like Katrina and I don't think he should toy with her emotions like that. She seems so nice and all.
Well, I was born to be a mother. Some of us are.
I just think it's too early to paint. That's my opinion.
I didn't do anything... I just... I've just been thinking.
Of course we're ready. We've taken all the classes. The nursery. The books --
No, it's fine. Thanks for making the call, I guess.
Yeah, downtown.
Adele for god sake please lis...
So you don't do any of those things.
Could I try that?
Sorry. Boy I'll tell ya, if Early found a picture of me like that I'd be black and blue for a week.
You think Early's bad to me, don't you?
Early, you are so sweet.
Almost.
I heard that.
They ain't dangerous Adele. They're writers.
You just smile, let me do all the talking.
Go back to the car and keep Brian there. I don't want him in here...  Do it Adele... Now!
It's Chinese food. It was the only place open. You said you was starving, you'd eat anyth...
Well Adele... it was for...  ...saving your fucking life back there!
She had a dream that somethin' like this was gonna happen.
Vernon, Florida.
Best kind.
Well, it's like this, Bri'. I don't eat much in the mornin', never have. Maybe a beer once in a while; Lucky Lager's my favorite.
Oh... I do some work up at the Merrick Mirror factory, or I used to...
Who?
Henry Lee Lucas. Well he was only convicted of killing eleven but he claimed to have killed over three hundred.
He almost always killed strangers. Spent years moving on from one place to another. That made it real hard to track him down.
...Then some.
Dahlia, no.
Yeah.
Nah... how much money have you got?
No, it's all yours. It's on me... for saving my ass back there.
If you say so.
...Ha.
A book on the warehouse murders?
It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you.
Real polite. Kept calling me 'sir.'
I still think we should have met them first.
Lighten up...
Hey, I got some great stuff... it's okay.
Fuck!
Why, what did he do?
I tried talking to her at the mine. It didn't work.
No.
He wasn't going to shoot her, you murdering son of a bitch!
Where would we find him?
With four of them, I didn't use any kind of protection. Wait, maybe it was three.
Yes!
Did what take?
Yeah.
You mean like fucking two virgins at once.
She's probably smash you in the fucking face.
Are you hungry?
Yeah, that would be fun but I don't like any of the girls you go out with. Like that one girl with two teeth and a clit ring.
I know what you mean.
So.
Fifteen for me.
Yeah probably.
Right here.
Probably. Fuck that, I'll sneak in. I need some female vagina tonight.
Yeah, watch where you walk dukes.
Right now?
Hold on.
You have?
You were?
Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you?
Tonight?
I don't know. I've never seen any of them before. Cornballs from Jersey on X. Feelin' the effex.
Yeah.
What?
15.
What?
Oh it's OK. That's life. Maybe tomorrow I'll win lotto. Who knows? You don't. No one does.
Yeah, I guess so.
Hello Paul. Is Telly inside?
I know.
Passion...
Yeah. And then it hits that little thing.  That little punch bag. What is it? The tonsils. The esophagus, whatever.
That's it. I'm gonna have to tell my little brother, I'm gonna die. I can't make him his lunches anymore.
Yeah?
I no understand you. Maybe crazy.
Whah you say? Dissdee?
Have you ever swallowed it before?
Making love is like.
It's like...
And we were blasted, and he must have been dumb horney. And he just pulled me over to the bed. And they were in the room, like getting dressed, like getting ready to go to go to Disco
Yeah I get bored.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You think so?
It's not his fault. He had a hard life.
You've heard the stories right?
Four-thirty in the morning?
That shit is nothin'. I remember, I had just turned 14. With this fuckin' asshole who was like 18. I don't even remember his name. I think it was John or Jake or something. I remember he had a brother named Lentil because I would always joke and call him Lentil Bean. This was away at like sleep away camp with your friends and shit.
It's very monotonous.
Come on Steven hook me up. Do me this solid.  Come on man. I gotta get Darcy alone. She's gonna let me fuck her man. Please.
Chess tournaments can be boring sometimes.  People have a lot of free time.  They like to gossip.
What are you saying?
No.
Maybe you should.
Then what's he talking about?
Sanderson?
I've got a feeling we're going to go the distance with him.  Let him sweat for a little while.
You don't want to think and that's why I'll win!  I'm already two points ahead.
You're not going to tell me that.
Do you know what I'm doing right now, Peter?  I'm looking at the name of the girl I'm going to kill tonight.
You heard me.  Why did you go out to the institute looking for her?
If you kill tonight and I'm in jail the police will know I'm innocent.
Can we correlate data?  Look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that?
Okay.  Run a search to see if there are any players with a rating above two thousand that live on the Island.
Have computer search for anyone that's used that opening against me.  There can't be more than a handful.
You still haven't figured it out, have you?   You think that I've put you through an ordeal.  My scars run so much deeper than yours.
You're damn right!  I'm a child psychologist and you send me into a room with someone who could be a murderer!
Oh, well we wouldn't want to disturb your guests, would we?
You could have been honest with me for starters.  We work together.  I have to be able to trust you.
He was watching you.
My cheering section.
I'm sorry, honey, I can't.  Not today.
Who's Kathy?
Not much.  There's no sign of a break in.  I think she let him in.
I'd say at least eighteen hours.
We're not sure.
And this Jeremy--
Well, the fact that he views this as a game suggests that he is trying to prove some sense of superiority -- and the way he murders confirms a need to be in complete control of his victim.
Anything else?
What did he mean by Huxley?
What does that mean?
No.  He was wearing a mask... but I saw the cut on his wrist.  It was Peter.
Ten days ago.
Through a rental agency.
Only in passing.  To say hello to.
"Wee Willie Winkie runs though the street."  We think he might be making a reference to himself.
"Is".  Did you tell him about the institute?
He uses castles...plural --  then says "can't move me."  Singular.  Not can't move us.
Are we going to go through this again?
You don't win by playing it safe, Peter.
I've got be here for the police when they come.  Then I've got to practise. In case you forgot I'm in the middle of a match right now.
Just thought you might want to talk.
Whatever's on your mind.
Yeah.  Just let me grab a shower.
Thank you.  I'm at 639-7393.
Sara, this is Doctor Sheppard.  I called you earlier about a book.
Uh huh.
I don't think I could.
Does what's going on bother you at all? Or are you just wearing your game face?
This isn't a game.
Let's change the subject.
Why?
You're not?
No.
Because I think he's wrong.
No.  You were talking about chess.
Then show me who you are.
I said I didn't plan on getting involved.
The line was busy.  I'll try again.
Because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid?
I can't think any more, unless it's about you.  I'll be in the middle of a match and instead of thinking about my next move, I think about how you look when you smile.  Remember how you said that I hide behind my chessboard?  Ever since my wife died I've been...  I've been afraid of getting too close to someone again -- afraid of losing them.
Frank told me.
Are you going to come tonight?
<u>What</u>?
Maybe you'd better look around for another candidate. I don't think my skin is tough enough to survive a lifetime of you and your brush.
No. They watch me closely, but they haven't harmed me.
Colwyn ...
Colwyn. Colwyn.  I love you, Colwyn.
That way. I can feel the cold.
I won't leave you here.
Does the Queen live?
In the old books. It's called a glaive.
Then we must be ready. Five leagues from here is the Eastern Tower. I know the Barons who hold it. Good men, and brave. They will help us.
Nor will I, till my bride is beside me.
Yes. They will be more help than high-born barons.
She is too deep. The curved tunnel we saw is part of the Vortex, the place of The Beast.
I'm not sure.
You will know, in good time.
No. She must agree of her own free will.
He sees betrayal everywhere. He will attack us so long as he is conscious.
You will tell me her name and we will go together.
The Beast will kill her.
Lyssa, your bracelets. Bend them straight and cross them.
Use your sword.
You're coming with us.
Each to his fate.
Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
Yes.
He saved our lives.
I have need of friends.
I knew you would not be. That's why I chose you.
They do not exist, except in the waters of the Swamp, where they will remain.
Yes, my lord.
Colwyn, don't be a fool. You can't do battle with that thing.
I am Quell.
A small house.
I cannot go with you, my friend.
You can have half.
I'd wish for a puppy.
First, you desert me, and now you mock me. Go back to your one-eyed friend.
I don't think it's working.
Would you desert your friends?
You had better manners as a pig.
Look at its insides.
You know nothing of power, you foolish girl. You think power is a mighty sword, or a strong castle, or the paltry magic of an Emerald Seer. Power is none of these.
Then look!
Then he will die!
It is important to assure the succession.
He leads a group of Slayers, under the leopard banner.
Such a vision will be opposed. Who seeks it?
Yes. It is the Western Ocean.
They will fail for, during the day, the power of the Circle is greater than theirs. Only at night can they pierce the Circle.
That creature helps no one. And none who go there return.
Her name is Death.
It is too late. He has drunk.
It is fifty years since I spoke it to you.
You said nothing. You told me nothing.
Power you have given me. What can my power give you?
No.
OK. Mister Stansfield, Norman STANSFIELD.
Yeah... How do you know it?
Yes.
Dirty work, and I kill no women and no kids.
Listen, think about what you want to do, but don't worry, your money is there and it's safer than in a bank... Banks are robbed every five minutes!
Huh... 500 meters?
Oh really?  But can you miss the car?
Yeah, but I didn't get him, I got his case and now he's behind the tree. What can I do?
OK.
You were scared, weren't you?
I killed him... and cut him and ate all of him... I left nothing for you!
No, you can't go out.
...This is what I don't like, you see: you don't refrain me, but at the same time I can't get out!
I never rent my gear.
Mathilda?!
...17.
I don't grow up any more. I just get older.
Well... I proposed them to play roulette...  Like we played...  ...And I lost.
Of course! I'm fine!  I put on your beautiful dress, I slightly made up...  I tried to get beautiful!  Don't you like it?
...Yes. The day he got out of jail. I allowed him to make ten steps... No more. And bang. Two hundred meters. By telescope. That night, I left my country and came here, to join my father, who worked for Tony.  ...I was 17. Then, I never left the city...  And never had another girlfriend...
Nothing, for the moment.
It's not me, it's dark here... and I can't find the switch.
Yeah... And still in Messina.  He's my uncle.
You're right, son. You must care the links with your family, always.  It's the only important thing in the world.
Adelle... Maurice is in the paper.
I received my B.S. from the University of Pennsylvania, my P.H.D. from Bryn Mawr College.  I worked three years at the Boston University School of Medicine, during which time I had articles printed in the "Journal of Educational Psychology", "American Journal of Psychology", "Psychology Review" and "Science"... So I think it's safe to say my opinion is valid.
Maybe one day -- after you've been married twenty years you'll understand.
I have to walk -- by myself -- all the way -- every inch.
I'll make it.
No it's not.
If you can't redo these six hundred miles when you're rested and ready, how are you possible going to walk another two thousand-five hundred miles in your present condition?
What?
I'm completing the walk.  I'm almost there.
A couple days to a few months if untreated.
Thank you.
No, I just don't want anybody dying because I didn't say something when I had the chance.
Okay.
What do you want from me?  Would I swim across an ocean for you?... Would I walk across the United States for you?  Yes... Yes I would.  You know that.
Exactly.  No reason.  No occasion. It just makes you feel good to do something for it, to express your pride and affection for it some how...  How come you'd do that for a piece of metal and not for me?
You like to take walks?
You can change.
Don't bring it in here -- it probably has all kinds of diseases.
He's plastered.
Yes.
Pacifica, California.
I don't want my wife's soul having any doubts.
About my love for her.
Not our problem.
This guy's not a murderer.
Maurice and Ellen Parker... it was issued in Philly... Mr. Maurice Parker has come a long way from home.  Why?
Making the grand total?
Mammoth.
Umm, no.  It's just that --
You're amazing.
No.  No... I won't be here for a while.  The store will be closed in the interim.
... The Grapes of Wrath.
I missed you to Mr. Parker.
What, come on?
It's mine to risk.
Which hospital?  Did you take me back?
Oh, that's not mine.
You should.  Children are a blessing from God.  I have four.
Yes.
What?  Who are you?
What are my choices?
No alcohol?
No.
Water?
Water.
No -- S.E.R.A.
Right, I'll get your door. I tend to fade in and out lately.
How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death?
Why should I? I know you're not a cop, so what is it tonight? Another two-fifty to watch you sleep?
No, I can't have dinner with you.
I have to change and take a shower first. If you want to come home and wait.
Is that really what you want to ask me?
Why don't you go in and sit down. I have some gifts for you.
I threw them into the garbage, which was perhaps immoral, but I wanted to come to you clean, so to speak. I thought we could go shopping and pick up a pair of jeans and forty- five pairs of underwear and just throw them out each day.
Do you want to go gambling tonight? We could go out and play for a few hours.
Well, then... I hope we don't run into any tonight.
I expect some kind of loyalty here. Just because I fuck for money doesn't give you cause to start picking up women and leaving me looking silly.
We?
I warned you...  ...but I'm sorry.
Can we just ignore it?
Do you want me not to go tonight?
They wouldn't know.
Yeah... I'd like that.
Fifth and Mayflower. You know it?
I didn't know I'd ever need it again.
And do what... rot away in a room?  We're not going to talk about that. Fuck you! I will not talk about that. You're staying here. You are not moving to a hotel.
Yes... I guess I knew that.
Alone. Alone. I'm here alone.
A date. What, are you a hooker?  What do you mean a date?  I've got a wife back home. I just came over to talk for a few minutes.
I am lonely, Yuri.
Where have you been staying?
I have a 4.0.
I can't give you that. And if you put me on the stand, I'll lie.
Get up.
He's the top defense attorney in the state. Of course he's an ass.
He's an ass that's gonna try.
You took my class in LA. You had the best high kick I've ever seen. Are you one of my lawyers?
I'm glad it's you and not Donovan.
Who could better understand than me?
Did she have a weapon in her hand?
Was there any evidence that Mrs. Windham shot him?
Not that I saw. But like I said, I went straight upstairs to take a shower.
Two a year since I was twelve. You do the math.
Because they got wet.
She's younger than I am. Did she tell you that? How would you feel if your father married someone younger than you?
Yes. But I can't tell you what it is.
Thank you.
You're a beautiful girl, Elle.
I saw Mrs. Windham standing over the body of Mr. Windham.
Oh, yes. Mrs. Windham is the most sweet, wonderful woman I know. I have loved her since the day she hired me. She could never do something this awful. I know this because we are very close.
I don't know.
Definitely! I love him!
That's because men are big, fat retards who don't -- Oh, my God...
No. Sometimes I say "Okay" instead of "Fine".
Trust me. You've got the equipment, you just need to read the manual.
Licensed attorney or family member?
Relation?
Although Mr. Huntington makes an excellent point, I have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of each sperm emission made throughout his life?
Too bad you and I are the only ones.
You guys are so sweet!
Not yet.
Neat.
Thanks again for your help!
And D) Brooke is obviously hiding something.
Maybe not to your face...
You're going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment? She's ly-ing.
Exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty-year-old man can take?
Well, you should -- If you look good, you feel good and if you feel good, you project joy into the world.
Gay men know designers. Straight men don't.
Law school was a mistake. Getting this internship was a mistake.
Are you asking me on a date?
You should. Do you have a resume?
And engraved... Gives it that extra little something, doesn't it?  See you tomorrow!
She was a Delta Gamma! Not in my pledge class or anything -- she graduated five years ahead of me. But I used to take her class at the LA Sports Club. She's amazing!
I mean, we're having a lot of fun now -- but things are gonna be different when I'm at Harvard. Law school is a completely different world. I need to be serious.
That's why I think it's time for us to --
You're breaking up with me because I'm too -- blonde?
Really?
A restaurant in Oakland. Where no one would recognize us.
Why do you say that?
Where's the Rock?
Helloo... you let him have anal sex with you.  Helloo... you let him videotape you diddling yourself.
I mean, I know you're upset and all, but can't you just take a sedative?
Precisely.  Faith has persuaded them a pygmie with a sling can kill an armed giant.
Always.
Not from me, surely...
I can keep a victim alive for weeks... months, if I desire it... it's an art.  They beg for death... I keep it just out of their reach.  The pain remains constant.
I see...
I don't expect you'd understand.
It's nothing.  My men take great delight in routing the enemy.  Don't trouble yourself, beauty.
Pleasure is for those who seize it! Do you think those insipid, pale- skinned mortals will ever know such rapture?
Or looked so beautiful...
Precisely, my darling.  Your animal strength, your primitive power has surfaced... you are what you desire.
I didn't know... I --
I said, I mean no harm... I thought this as empty tomb.
We be honored, friend Ogg.
Why, Jack, then tis your death song I'll be strumming.
Jenny Greenteeth?  Who's she?
Aye.  Black Baron's mischief.
What's left of me... How do I recognize the armor of Achilles?
Better we eat him than the other way round.
We've no time for tricks this day, Honeythorn Gump.
Drop a mountain on him and we won't need our troops.
Aye.  And hang his foul hide up like dirty laundry for the drying.
Foul fellow, this Couer de Noir.
Something the matter?
Very secretive, they are.  Keep their feet covered up.  Best if you don't mention it.
Stoutly spoke, lad.  These dwarves be sore grouches... Pay no heed to their spiteful grumbling.
We're not in a tournament, Gump.  Ah, but a sword twice tempered in the blood of living dragons...
Willful creature, that one...
No, thank the Lord, but she be sore envenomed by the spider's bite.
No... but what choice have we?
It's your own fear troubles you... We're here, aren't we?  For all the dark magic protecting it.
We'll need more siege machinery and longer scaling ladders.
Defend ourselves.  We've bested far worse already.
Never mind.  Just do it!  Retrieve the arrows somehow.
And frog don't fly and bite like tomcats.  It be magic, Jack... powerful ogre's magic.
Faerie magic's no match for a sorcerer's power... We have Ogg's gifts, the key and the --
Did you bring me here to sup?
Plan on carrying some away in a kettle?
Tis not the wound, that's sure.  Not a scar remains... we're talking about a spell; harder to repair than sword-work.
Might not need a gesture quite so grand.  What were you doing the very moment the Baron's curse fell on the world?
No, no, no... this is different!
These chaps'll need a woodpecker to pick their teeth.
Gonna make ogre-stew!
Or perchance...
Stop complaining.
Your command is my wish, Princess Lili.
In these woods you are a commoner. Now be quiet.  True royalty approaches.
They rival the angels of paradise.
Are you honest?
To fetch your napkin.
I don't know.  They've hurt the unicorn.
I didn't know... I didn't...  It was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... I...
Oh, yes, and the mare with him.
Oh, la...
And I... love you...
Ouch!  Something's biting me.
His feet shall never cross my lips.
Couer de Noir!  A demon if the Devil ever made one.
You'll need the fastest steed alive, for Couer de Noir's castle rests at the very edge of the earth.  Only the sharpest sword and the golden armor of Achilles will protect you from his fury.
Follow the raven in her flight, Follow old black wing to the edge of night...
Princess?  I know of no princess.
She's dead!
Dead, dead, dead.
Far as you're concerned she's dead, believe it or not.
Then I'd kiss you without turning my garments inside-out and sewing bells all over.
Then why do you speak sweeter words to Jenny Greenteeth?
Jest with me then.
Small miracles better than no miracles...
Up ahead!
Achilles wore it before the gates of Troy.
Castle Couer de Noir built with magic... simple as death... strong as hate...
You follow.
I thought I might stop by.
I wanna be with you today.
Sam!
I guess it depends on what you give up on.
I don't think Dad wants you home.
I couldn't sleep last night.
I'll survive.
He wouldn't use around me.  I don't like any of it.
I want you to try something with me, okay?
Maybe your tongue...I don't know, my mouth is numb.  Why did you do that?
He jumped into the ocean.
I can use your mom's.
His parents took his car.  They're making him ride a bicycle the rest of the summer.
Why are you so stupid?
You're off, you know?  You're way, way off.
If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.
He's got a standing invitation.
Just, I mean, well, you're here every single day.
It could have been a squirt gun.
He builds models for architects.  His dad, on the other hand, was the real deal.  Designed and built the coolest houses I've ever seen.
He wants the entire roof taken off and lowered.
I'm not.
We were probably in school together.  You went to Berkley?
It may sound that way, but I react out of fear.  My life has nothing to do with what I like or don't like.  You haven't been listening, have you?
For everything.
Good.  I was hoping for that.
Yes, it is.
Thank you.
We're getting out of the ground today.
He escaped.  He's going back in.
I'll ask.
I know what the deal is.  Josh is a pimp. I'm not stupid.
Why would you be there?
You live in Cory's parents' cabin?
I'll get your bag.
I almost saw Catalina.
Why?
You're so predictable.
And I don't take a shower in the middle of the yard.
I don't know.
The game was to make me smaller than he was.  No matter what.  He could be almost invisible as a human being, but I had to be smaller.  So if I got good grades, I was a pussy for not playing football.  If I cut my hair for him, it wasn't short enough.  If I shaved it, I looked like a psycho.  I never won the game.  Not once. And if he couldn't make me smaller with words...
To hide a black eye.
I think she was terrified of living with him...but maybe even more terrified of life without him.
Everything would have been better if you had.  You'd have liked your grandmother. And there'd be a girl out there that'd have her mother.  I remember reading about her in the paper.  They couldn't find her father and her mother was dead. I still feel guilty about that.
That's so weird...
Absolutely.  Have him put it on a separate line.  At Christmas, we'll pact it so full of lights, we'll make God wear sunglasses.
What's wrong with your back?
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
Well, congratulations!  You fucking pulled it off!
We just weren't very much alike, I guess. I don't know.  I liked your dad more than I liked you.
Left you this place.
Thanks for telling me.
I need you to do me a favor.
I want you to find someone for me.
I don't let him.  He just loves to.
Ring the bell before you try the door.
Thanks for waking me up.  Picking me up. You're loud today.
You're the most beautiful woman I have ever known in my life.
I want him with me.
He's not spending the summer in Tahoe.
He's not spending the entire summer with another kid in Tahoe.  If he leaves, I will follow him up there and I will drag him home by his nose ring.  He can hate me.  You can hate me.  He can try to kill me while I sleep.  You can call the police.  You can call your husband or your attorney, but Sam is spending the summer with me.  He's my son.  He's sixteen.  That's it.
What?
Which?
We have it on video!  Was that when?  My parents were down for his sixth birthday! I remember that.
The antibiotics weren't working.  It's what I believe, George.
He won't use my shower.  I don't get it.
I think so.
I smiled at him.
No.  Why?  I like to be with Sam.
How much time do they get to spend with their dad?
What did I say?
No.  Mostly me.
Left you?
What did he say?
You got any weed?
Who?
The payoff.
We should take a vacation.
Sooner than the Fall.
So am I, Robin.  I'm working at something, too.  I'm even talking.  Do you want to be around for it?
You live a fabulous life, Robin.
No.
Okay.
I don't know what I'm doing.
I just thought it would be nice.
Can we really help build a house?
Someone stop her!
Better make it a week.
Is Mae Rose okay?
Thought you'd never ask. Biscuit needs some gravy.
Cost you a pair of nylons.
Not for me, it ain't.
We played down in Jackson yesterday. Heard a rumor you've got a boy up here who can hit the ball a ton.
Can't Get Right? That's the kid's name? Can I talk to him?
Crawford's are always looking for new talent.
There are ways around that. Right sergeant?
But you can't.
Then what's the problem?
Well, alright then. What do you think about this new tie?
Take care of me?
I'm too old for you. Besides, I'm not much in the mood.
Yes, boss.
He's right, Gibson. Put down the gun and we'll work this out.
He don't sound like he's from 'round here.
Of course I did. He said he'd file an appeal right away. You didn't tell me he was so good looking.
He seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me. His offices take up an entire floor of that big, new building on 125th Street, and he was using all these words I never heard before. He even offered me a job.
Ray Gibson?  No, no. He's the reason I'm in here, Daisy. For all I know, he's got a record a mile long. I got a better shot of getting out of here on my own. You tell Maynard to think about me, concentrate on me. Understand?
I really shouldn't. I gotta keep an eye on my friend.
Why would you want to go home? It's so early.
Look, man, I don't want friendly conversation. I don't want to be your friend. I've seen your friends and I don't like them. I just want to do this thing and get back to New York in time to start my job.
Damn straight, it is. I got my own set of keys because I'm supposed to open up. So if I ain't there 8 a.m. Monday morning, there's gonna be hell to pay.
Nothing.
Hey, you'd be surprised what you find in other people's pockets. Just gotta avoid them deadbeat bank tellers. Get you every time.
A loan officer?
Yeah? Who'd he steal it from?
Don't Uncle Claude me. You get a load of those crackers? Couldn't be a mouthful of teeth among the bunch of 'em. Why you want to pick a fight with people like that for?
What'd you say?
What are you complaining about? It worked out. Everything's cool. Now, come on, let's head down there and see what's shaking. We deserve a little reward.
There are people down there having fun. I want to be one of them. I want you to be one of them. On Monday you can be a bank teller if you want, but tonight you're a bootlegger with a truck full of Puerto Rican rum and a fistful of cash.
So you made a generous contribution.
That was mighty charitable of you, Claude. Looks like we both got fucked tonight.
We've still got 36 cases of rum. That's better than money.
Life?! What's life mean? There's no way I can do life. I got a job starts Monday morning!
Somebody just told me he wins the three-legged race every year.
What about you, Radio?
Pack of lies. Don't listen to him. We didn't kill nobody. We were railroaded. And we gonna prove that.
Getting a map from a chubby chef named Cookie? Dragging our asses through the swamps in search of some worm-eaten boat? That ain't a plan, that's a vacation for two in the hole. When you've got a map to New York City, you get back to me.
Yeah.
We? Did I hear you say we? As I recall, you're the one who said there is no we. Guess we got some bad news in that letter, huh?
Well, let's just think about that for a moment. He's a successful lawyer up in New York City and you're down here with a bright future in the cotton picking business. Eeny, meeny, miney, Maynard.
At least you're honest for once. So now you want to be my friend? Well, let me tell you something, Claude-my- shit-don't-stink-Banks. You got a lot to learn about friendship.
I don't think so, Claude. You'd just slow me down. We'd have to stop every five minutes so you could polish your silverware. There's no way around it, you're soft.
I said you're soft.
I'm stuck!
He'd be doing me a favor. I'm getting outta here one way or the other! Goddamn rats and shit! Fuck!
Hey, man, is Babe Ruth in the lineup today?
I'm sick of watching Camp 12 win the championship. Every year they get to roast the victory pig and we get dick. This year I want that pig.
Let me see that.
They're called pilots! I'm serious, Ray. I'm not in the mood for one of your stupid, fucked-up plans right now.
Maybe you're fooling yourself, Ray. Maybe you're just a chip off the old block.
I'm not working on a plan.
That's because you're soft. Gimme the gun.
I said you're soft.
He knows nobody wants to hear the truth.
An erection, huh? Haven't had one of those in a while.
'Course I was right. About what?
Shh! Is that so hard to believe?
Never thought I'd hear Ray Gibson say that. Hell with you then. You'd only slow me down anyway.
Why the hell not?
'Preciate it. Claude.
Those are for trusties, unless you got thirty cents or two packs of cigs.
You killed Santa Claus?
Well, not yet. It's still in the planning stages.
Made just for you, Cookie.
State of Mississippi wants this ditch cleared by sundown. You got that?!
You heard what the man said! Move it!
Just because it's in my mind, Goldmouth, don't mean it ain't real. Everything worth anything starts with a dream.
Hey, Ray...
I'm going in for him. He'd do the same for me.
What difference does it make? Natchez was better off without Winston Hancock! Who cares if a couple of no- account bootleggers went to jail for his killing? At least the state of Mississippi got 40 years of cheap labor out of the deal!
Excuse me, sheriff. As we explained to your associate here, there's been a mistake. We didn't kill anybody. Now, as for the bootlegging, we happen to work for a very important man in New York.
Sure don't. Mind if I ask where you got it?
You all been here a long time. Doesn't anybody ever escape from this place?
I'm talking about old Satchmo nearly blew the roof off the joint.
All I need is the front money and a truck. I could be back in two, three days tops if I had somebody to share the driving.
He's sick?
What do you think about... Earth?
...their damned souls will be ours.
You mother...
Don't do it!
Or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity.
Well tell her I said "hi" back.
You're already there...
He'll be here. Just keep your cool, kid.
It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.
Got ya.  Is it okay if I do the sleep thing?
But those are my roommate's sodas...
I think you're looking at him.
Please, pop, just go back to your room.
Sure, pop. Whatever you want.
C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one Superbowl ring.
You did it for Namath.
This is bullshit, man.  I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year, with or without you!
Oh, and don't forget, you're shoving a pineapple up Hitler's ass at four o'clock.
Metallica, Dad. Come on.
Coulda been much worse.
That's a pretty brassiere.
Beast.
I got hit by a big light that was attached to a lot of metal.
By she, do you mean he?
Little nervous. Wanna puke.
We know where to find Nicky.
Yes, great movie...
Dude, it's us. Let us in.
You smell like coconuts.
Basically, yeah.
Nicky? Oh my God. Stay right there.
Why would you be floating?
...to decompose. And I love my Dad very much. So I came to Earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and I met you and... well, my dog tells me I just might be in love with you.
"Mister Crowley, what's inside of your head..."
From my dad's side of the family.
Eight-hundred, split down the middle. Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits.
See something you like, my man?
Anything to eat?
Let me sculpt you and I will show you where the others have gone.
Regular storage procedure... the same as the other food... The other food stopped coming and they started.
Thanks.  I thought you'd be older. I expected a Red.
Open your eyes once, idiot.  It's not every day that a Sandman son is born. I'm telling you, Francis -- that's him!
You? Why? You're already beautiful.
Nobody. I felt sad... I put myself on the circuit.
No.
Why is it wrong to run?
K.
But I wasn't sure you'd come.
I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?
Both... running's what I'm interested in.
I let him go... believe me.
Maybe you'll think of something...
Maybe they're angry because they're grown in meccano-breeders.
Some people say children need human mothering.
But what is this -- why?
How will they know we're coming?
I doubt it.
Of course.
"Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife". What can all that mean?
It could be...
Things won't change... you know that! We can live here together, Logan... have a life as long as his... together!
Beloved wife...
It's part of the hydrogalvanic system. The ocean tides are changed into energy somehow.
At least it's over...
Oh, my...
It's all right with me. Is he here?
Just a place, I suppose... who knows?
Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father?
Not yet.
You don't seem quite sure, Jessica.  Can you do it? Will you?
Where to? Hey, Lanie, I heard you were out of it for a while, too.
Sheila'll be at "Tops".
You gotta be kiddin'... This is the boulevard... You can't hear yourself think.
Yeah.
Sure, I'm okay.
It kept going off for some reason. False alarms.
Maid? Relative?
Yeah.
Yeah, I remember.
Over there.
I think he suspects something... We have to be careful... I miss you.
Me, too.
Andy?
Okay.
Alice?
Alice?
Yes, I believe so.
Sure.
You really don't remember the other night, do you?
Yeah? what did they want?
Did you tell the police this?
His physical condition.
Are you hungry, honey? I'll fix you something.
No... Here he comes.
He... He can't talk. it appears as if he can't talk, anyway.
No, sir, it's not.
I couldn't say, sir... Captain Henderson?
Captain... this is some spooky shit we got here.
You say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday?
Pete, what happened to you?
Nothin'.
I... I didn't say anything...
No... There is, I mean, I use it as a practice room... it's soundproofed.
The first night... Not the last two.
The pain is getting worse. I need more aspirin.
But my head...
No, no I don't. Are you sure?
What do you mean? You're where right now?
I must have fallen asleep. I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I?
Yeah?
Yes, I just found it on the step.
How could I miss it? The TV won't quit with that stuff.
Andy's from Utah. He says there you have a choice... You can die by hanging or by firing squad.
I wouldn't... The brain would know what's going on. Your heart would be ripped open trying to pump blood, blood pouring into the chest cavity. Savage pain, Marian.
No, no... It's okay, Mr. Eddy.
All right!
Fifteen car lengths. About two hundred and seventy feet.
Hey, Pete... How ya doin'?
You're doin, okay?  That's good, Pete.
I'm really glad you're doin' okay, Pete.
I don't remember... What happened that night?
I don't want to talk about it...
YOU'RE SORRY!!
Oh, read it!
Yes. Might as well - all of it.
Yes. Those are our own people. They never venture beyond the point where you were met this morning. It is much too hazardous.
Knighted! You don't say. Do you mind if I take a look at it?
This is the only thing I was able to save when those heathens surrounded me.
It was the vertebrae of a Megatherium - found in Asia.
Sir Henry Derwent was knighted, and he never got beyond the mesozoic era.
Okay, sister.  No offense. No offense!
Good morning—
Well, it's a good morning, anyway.
Why, of course. Yes.
That's ridiculous.
Yes!
You never looked better in your life. As soon as our clothes are cleaned, they're going to give them back to us, Lovey.
I'm thinking.
Uh-huh.  Did you ever hear of Chalmers Bryant?
Just call me Barney.
Horns? What kind of horns?
I'm going to sleep in my bed. Come on, Lovey!
I'll say.
Please! Please! Do not wait for me! I eat so very little.
Mr. Chang - High Lamas or Low Lamas, do we get the porters?
Say, what about that gold deal?
Say, listen - will you go and annoy the rest of your playmates? Let me alone!
How do you do?
How do you deal with incorrigibles? Criminals?
Centuries.
Our Valley is very rich in a metal called gold, which fortunately for us is valued very highly in the outside world. So we merely . . .
A Belgian priest by the name of Father Perrault, the first European to find this place, and a very great man indeed. He is responsible for everything you see here. He built Shangri-La, taught our natives, and began our collection of art. In fact, Shangri-La is Father Perrault.
Yes. Oddly enough, later, when he had learned to understand their language, the natives told him he could have saved his leg. It would have healed without amputation.
Why, Mr. Conway, you surprise me!
I don't need any advice from you! Get me a doctor!
No doctors?  That's fine. That's just fine.
Well, we've been expecting this particular shipment for the past two years.
Why, no.
Then it's done.
Pardon me—
Are you so certain you are away from it?
Don't believe him, Bob. He's just trying to get out.
Now, my dear boy. You shouldn't—
Oh, the girl at the piano?
But to be candid, Father, a prolonged future doesn't excite me. It would have to have a point. I've sometimes doubted whether life itself has any. And if that is so, then long life must be even more pointless. No, I'd need a much more definite reason for going on and on.
Come on! Quick! This way.
Aha - very good, Freshie.[3] Very good. You'd better put his name on the list and make out a report later.
The bloke up there looks a Chinese, or a Mongolian, or something.
What do you mean if we should get out?
What's on your mind, Bob? You talk as though we're going to have trouble getting out of here.
Porters?
I don't know what you're talking about. You're carrying around a secret that seems to be eating you up. If you'll only tell me about it.
I don't need any proof.
I don't believe it! I don't believe a word of it!
Yes.
Hiding? Oh, no. Hunting - I was in the interior - hunting fossils. This morning I looked up suddenly—
Of course. We never left the air. I know - I didn't sleep the whole night long.
What's he doing? Where's he taking us? He may be a maniac for all we know.
What if he refuses?
Brilliant!  Can anyone here fly a plane?
In for what?
A little boy whistling in the dark!? Do you realize that there is a British cruiser waiting at Shanghai, smoke pouring out of its funnels, tugging at its moorings, waiting to take Mr. Conway back to London? Do you know that at this minute there are headlines shrieking all over the world the news that Conway is missing? Does that look like a man whose life is empty?
I wonder.
Then it wouldn't be a garden spot for long.
Yes.  Barney!
I guess I lost:
For instance...  It says here you lost your parents at 15, and, since then...
No. But You'll get used to it.    Welcome to the Men in Black.
Further... what are you talking about, air?  That makes no sense-- I hold three cadet class records--
I'd go with number three.
Oh yeah?  The hell you weren't. Little pither just out of school...
Dee, you've been useful for 50 years.  We're clueless, you're tired. Why don't you go home and get some rest.
We wear black.
I understand.  Hey, it works for the Hasids, right?  No one recognizes them.
Right.
So what's the problem?
It's the way we do it.  The way we've always done it.
Why?
History's proven that where there's a nitrogenizer, there's a 12-legged signazoid.  They use it to make our food digestible for their systems.
Then wouldn't we also know if he's here?
We're rising.
The Pentagon.
Well... if you think about it, then it would mean that maybe everything he's saying is true.
I know you don't trust him.  You don't trust anybody--
Well, if the bugs have hatched, and they're not here... then where are they?
All of it?
Not her. Me.    They're beautiful, aren't they? The stars. I never just look anymore and they're beautiful.
With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
Do have any idea what I just said?
But it's definitely a nest, isn't it?
Actually... I don't know.
Are you sure you don't?
Well I'm going to give them something to be afraid of.
Come on now.  People are smart.
We've got about eight or nine prospects	I want you look--
Nothing.
Noon exactly.
How'd you know that?  Kay?
Will it lower the curve?
Scientific American?  Really?
Come again?
Highway 119, just west of Smith. Why?
Keep an eye on things there.  We'll see what we can find out at Ernie Goosels.
They went right to the President.
Did it leave?
Anderton --
I can't leave.  You said so yourself, there is no Minority Report.  I don't have an alternative future.
Someplace safe.
She died?
What --
Then who was he?
I know... I do, too...
That's comforting.
Yeah --
It's all I could safely move.
Baltimore.  Eastside.  Solomon P. Eddie M.D.  I was a plastic surgeon.
This about the Justice Department?  They laid on a tour for tomorrow a.m.  Told me to wear a tie.  You like this one?
... Graveyard shift.
Uh-huh...
Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what --
He's not.  He's looking for a flaw in us, John.
Stop.  Just wait.  Who's the victim?
Then come to my house.  We'll talk --
I just wanted to congratulate you. You did it.  You've created a world without murder.  So what if you had to kill someone to do it.
Armor up -- sick-sticks and concussion guns -- this is gonna be close.
Red Ball -- double homicide: one male, one female.  Killer's male, white, 40's.
Run the subscription list...
Georgetown.
Sir?
Check NCIC, maybe he's got a record.  Then send a protection team as soon as we lock the location.
Yes.
You ever get any false positives? Someone intends to kill his boss or his wife, but they never go through with it.  How do the precogs tell the difference?
Speaking of interfacing, I'd love to say hello.
There's no way of knowing for sure. She could've forgotten whatever it is you're looking for...
I need help with her.
No.  No way.  I wouldn't even know where to begin!  Those thoughts about my cousin Elena -- they were just thoughts. I would never --
They don't belong to anybody.
That's great.
What a big boy.  How old are you?
I lived for a year with a man who was pretending to be my father.  He took me all over the world.
I'm your son.  I'm you.
Hold your breath, Dad...
NO!
Crow.  I'm not gonna kill you.
You're not gonna kill me...
I'm not.  I was trying to heal them, not turn them into... something else.
The innocents we now use to stop the guilty.
Most of the time, all three Precognitives will see an event in the same way.  But once in a while, one of them will see things differently than the other two.
Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.
But you will bring it down if you kill Leo Crow.  Why, that will be the most spectacular public display of how Precrime... didn't work.
I said the record is destroyed. The original report exists for all time.  I designed the system so that whenever a report occurred, it would be stored in a safe place -- but not declared.
Actually, I think you'll have to run out, but yes, that's what you have to do.
Sometimes in order to see the light, you have to risk the dark.
It's always in the more gifted of the three.
Lamar --
Anne Lively... But I never said she drowned.
Not.  Now.
I don't want John Anderton hurt.
Danny, tell me what you're thinking.
We teach the tech's to identify them and disregard...
I wanna kill my boss.
No, I wanna kill my boss!
I'm sure you've all grasped the legalistic drawback to precrime methodology.
Somehow, I don't think that was Walt Whitman.
Cause all of a sudden you got no one you can fucking brown nose anymore.
I'd love to, but I've got an open house today at the Ressler place.
Thank you.  He hasn't tried to contact you?
You mean after he lost your son.
I left him because every time I looked at him, I saw my son.  Every time I got close to him, I smelled my little boy.  That's why I left him.  And now you can leave.
They were grabbing her fucking ass --
No thank you.
Just give me the key. I'm gonna stay here.
Is it a good room?
Here. Take it. Bring me back eighty.
Yeah. Take it.
Is it the good room?
Come on. Just tell me. It'll save all the trouble of you showing me all the rooms.
No. That's cool. Bring me back eighty.
We're in Fashion.
No more.
Will you paint the damn thing. Why do you gotta be such a baby.
Hi, baby. What are you doing awake? Where's mommy?
Mommy's not home?
They're not too classy to have tits rubbed in their face.
Fine. You want to help Ricky, talk to Maxie yourself.
Shhh. He'll hear you.
Look at the bills. I can't. I'm not gonna put my daughter through what I went through.
Yeah, well Max offers a lot of things. And I got news for you. He's not the sweet old man you think he is.
Don't get my hopes up. If I quit, what then? I can't go through this again.
What'd you say?
Yeah, sure.
You driving her?
Yeah. Where is he?
Was gonna be tomorrow morning. Now, who knows?
No.
Yeah?
That's it.
Where's Ricky.
She was fast, huh?
Yeah.
What about Ricky? He'd jump at the opportunity.
He'll work it off.
You're ready to move up. Christ, the way you busted up the place, you're doing worse already. May as well get paid instead of punished.
Do me a favor. Think about it. Is that too much too ask?
I didn't tell him shit. He worries too much. I love that old Jew, but he's gonna kill himself worrying. We started this shit, and we're gonna finish it.
Hi. I'm Jimmy.
Well, this is the corner.
Thanks a lot. Don't worry about it.
What are you saying?
Yeah, I'm 5-5 and 1.
Yeah. I know the number.
Then why do you try to get in?
No. You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
What happened to boxing? I thought we made a vow.
We'll kill Fairfax this year.
Nah, don't bother --
You sure?
Relax. You got one-fifty. You heard the guy.
We just got moved up in the world. You gotta let go of that blue collar mentality that was drummed into your head. You gotta start owning it man, or they'll smell you a mile away like a cheap suit.
As a matter of fact I was. You got a problem with that?
What the fuck do you...
Don't even start.
I mean, that's what I heard --
Missing what? He didn't say shit.
Like I said, I don't know.
You would think.
Fuck this.
Fine.
Do not put this on Ruiz's tab. Start a new one.
We're getting whacked.
I got a bad feeling, man. I don't want to go in naked.
I'm your soldier.
They only cover one fifty in incidentals. You've been ordering fucking... Motherfucker...
What do you mean 'kinda?'
I'm just warning you, I can't swim.
Maybe you wanna try the China Club.
Yeah, sure. How much are they?
Drinks are free, right?
Where do you live?
Jimmy knows. 13th Street. We'll meet you there.
Maxie knows I don't go near drugs. I did a minute in Quentin for possession with intent. And it ain't now cause he woulda told me.
I know what 'strapped' means, motherfucker. What the fuck you think this shit is? '21 Jump Street?'  Cool out, they're coming back. Just throw up your screw face and don't speak unless spoken to.
Why? What I say bad?
Like you were doing any better shucking and jiving like you were waiting for wings outside the Quick and Split.
Watch it...
I don't fuck with those crazy, off- the-boat fuckin Irish. You heard of the Westies?.
I've heard you've got the best coke in the States. The shit back home is pants.
Here...
You think this shit's funny, Ho?
Soho Grand, right?
I handle most of Cardiff Giant's stuff.
The 'job?' Alls I know is I'm taking you to the Soho Grand.
Not usually. Mostly Trustafarians.
We're square.
We're going to New York?
You will not carry any other pagers with you. You will not carry anything, for that matter, that I have not just given you.
Tell me.
Will you tell Peter Jennings to shut up and fucking listen. The shit's as routine as you get. I coulda turned it over offshore in a week, but Maxie likes to do it all his way. Safe. I coulda dropped the bag alone. It's only two hundred G's. But he sent you all. So I can either send you home and tell Maxie, or we can flush the toilet one more time and hope it all goes down.
What?
Red, and I ain't no punk.
'Cause I want in. And it don't take a lot to know you there, daddy.
I done told the man what he could do with his train.
Solid, daddy.
You _took_ me, you bastard, and now I'm taking you.
Yeah.
Don't push it. You way ahead. You back on top. That boy loves you, man.
You need something. It's not a reefer, but it'll help some.
That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
Man, you been locked up too long, everybody conks. All the cats.
Let it burn. Maybe you'll hear me then.
Man, I don't want to hear all that.
Tell you this: you ain't no fool.
But everything the white man taught you, you learned. He told you you were a black heathen and you believed him. He told you how he took you out of darkness and brought you to the light. And you believed him. He taught you to worship a blond, blue-eyed God with white skin -- and you believed him. He told you black was a curse, you believed him. Did you ever look up the word black in the dictionary?
Go on, fool; the marble shooters are waiting for you.
You got to learn everything the white man says and use it against him. The truth is laying there if you smart and read behind their words. It's buried there. You got to dig it out.
Read it and keep on reading.
-- the hardest and the greatest.
Mr. X, I was out there tonight. I saw what you did. I want to be a Muslim. I ain't never seen a Negro stand up to the police like that.
And now, without further remarks, I present to you one who is willing to put himself on the line for you --
Shall I tell my sisters that we oppose marriage?
How do you like it?
Oh? Purely scientific interest I'm sure.
Are you?
Hush your mouth.
We've never had a fight. Not a real one. But we're going to have one right now if you don't talk about it.
Dear heart, I love you.
Betty it's me. It's me.
Don't answer the phone. It's all right. It's all right. Nothing is gonna happen to anybody.
At the Hilton. The girls asleep?
Malcolm, where are you? We've been calling all over the city.
Is my family here yet?
That's right.
I told you we don't know for certain.
But we do know that the people of that region of Asia Minor, from the Tigris-Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean, are dark-skinned people. I've studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels. I have never seen a native of that area who was not black.
Allah Akbar.
I say a lot of things.
Do your job, Get me a bourbon on the rocks and a pack of Lucky's.
Burglary, count one -- 8 to 10 years; count two, 8 to 10 years; count three, 8 to 10 years...
What for? I ain't white and I don't put out.
All them books you read and you still don't know nuthin.
These are my children. Mine. And they ain't no question. None.
500.
And don't come back.
You better believe it.
Baby, I got to let this old man win. Keep the faith, and tell Billie I'll see her later.
Make it too easy and it ain't no fun.
Naw, you missed me, copper. Try this on for size.
The hell you are.
Jesus ain't got nothin' to do with this.
Jesus Christ, Homey, you are nuts.
I've been clean for twelve years, Shorty.
Allah will provide.
Believe it or not, you're safe here. The Judicial police will kill you. If they can.  This page?
It's not worth it. Be with them instead.
My deal is with Rosanna. I knew you guys were up to something. Are you two fucking?
I'm not... easy.
[I'm on to Juarez.]
[I have a friend there.]
[It's a permit to carry a gun in Columbia. The gun you're about to find in that suitcase.]
So what do I get in return?
[What is his name?]
[Aurillio Rosas Sanchez.]
[Everything on the cellphone. We wait for calls. We have no number to call.]
[We have an ATM bank card. We draw out 300 dollars every two weeks.]
[The what?]
[No!]
[So am I, Sister.]
[Who are you?]
[I told you, non-negotiable.]
[Listen! I will give you a life for a life.]
[You're a liar. Pinta's dead.]
[And one of the founding members of La Hermanidad.]
Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226.
It's loaded.
Creasy??? Where the fuck are you?
Japanese are here in a big way. Cheap labor. Factory space. But they feel a lot safer living over the border in El Paso. I ferry 'em back and forth. They think I'm John-fucking- Wayne.
Fuck, I love Mexico. I live like a king down here.
Not for eight months. I was in Columbia looking around, but, nothing seemed interesting.
And what if, just say, there was a kidnap attempt?
I came to visit you.
You got tossed. Don't trust the cops, especially the Judicials.  Oh you know that?
I said the plan was right here.
I'll get you up to the border. Friend of mine'll take you in to San Diego. Drop you right at the hospital.
If they like me.
Who's Emilio?
You can drive and talk at the same time, can't you?
Why not?
Places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. But you don't have to understand. I do. So no talking.
Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking?
That's right.
No.
I go to school, don't I?
My ankle.
I'm too old for him. Don't tell my friends.
It was in a book at school. Concubine.
[Yeah. Can you imagine my mother multiplied by a thousand?]
No, that was in Columbia.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
Could I stop you?
Still not a question.
Frank. Frankie.
There's no such thing as tough, Creasy. Just trained and untrained.
Dyslexic?
So are you.
You're paying me to protect her, not amuse her. Right?
If something happened, my reaction would be to fight to protect her. I have skills in that respect. Pinta would benefit by the fact that... I'm a soldier.
Stay here. If you do something stupid, we won't get her back.
What was her name?
Do you know what she told me last night?
Yeah? And if she was ugly?
I have a policy, AIG. It covers me and my family and when it runs out in sixty days, without a bodyguard, I will not be able to renew it.
I know! I just had to let one go because I couldn't afford him!
[Yes.]
Well, think about going to sleep. Good night, baby.
You're going to miss Mexican Halloween. The Day of the Dead.
Lisa Martin Ramos, Mr. Creasy.
Hmm?
That's ridiculous.
[It's a moral issue. On one hand you're cleaning up the bad guys, but in another way we are feeding the problem that produces bad guys.]
[No. Not by the rules of polite society at least.]
That's what friends do.
I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
I feel fine.
You know what they say. They say things are no good in this house. Catherine, your son is married. Leave him in peace. He wantsa be alone with his wife. They don't want no old lady sitting inna balcony. Now I tell you what I think. I want you come live with me in my house with Marty and me. In my house, you have your own room. You don't have to sleep onna couch inna living room like here. We will cook inna kitchen and talk like when we were girls. You are dear to me, and you are dear to Marty. We are pleased for you to come.
Were the lights on?
I don't sell this house, I tell you that. This is my husband's house. I had six children in this house.
I was up here twice before. Once with a friend of mine and once I came up alone. The last time... do you see that girl in the gray dress sitting over there?
Well, the last time I was up here, that's where I sat. I sat there for an hour and a half, without moving a muscle. Now and then, some fellow would sort of walk up to me and then change his mind. I'll never forget just sitting there for an hour and a half with my hands in my lap. Then I began to cry, and I had to get up and go home.
I'm having a very good time, too.
I'm thirty-four.
Benjamin Franklin High School.
Thank you.
I don't.
I'm afraid of being lonely.
Actually, I don't make friends easily.
I just wanna kiss, that's all.
Please...
Nothing.
We just live one flight up.
Hobby! What can she do? She cooks and she cleans. You gotta have a house to clean. You gotta have children to cook for. These are the terrible years for a woman, the terrible years.
Well, I don't know the people, of course, but as a rule, I don't think a mother-in-law should live with a young couple.
I don't think a mother should depend so much upon her children for her rewards in life.
It's silly of me to argue about it. I don't know the people involved.
Well, I bumped into her on the street, and she was as big as a barrel.
That's the one.
Sure, great if you ain't married.
What girl, what does she know?  Why don't you let her hold the baby once in a while?! Your mother, boy, she wantsa take the kid for a day, that's fine!
Marty, Thomas and Virginia are here. They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine. So they ask me, would it be all right if Catherine come to live with us. So I said, all right with me, but we have to ask you. Marty, she's a lonely old lady. Nobody wants her. Everybody's throwing her outta their house...
You gonna die without a son.
Oh, it's a sad business.  My sister, Catherine, she don't get along with her daughter-in-law, so she's gonna come live with us.
I offered her, Ma, she don't want nothing.
What, Ma?
What didn't you like about her?
Hey, Lou, gimme two bottles-a beer...
That's right, Missus Fusari. It was a very nice affair.
No, that's my other brother, Freddie. My other brother Freddie, he's been married four years already. He lives down on Webb Avenue. The one who got married Sunday, that was my little brother, Nickie.
You just sit here, I gotta turn the fire on under the cooking. 
I just can't stand it any more! Every minute of the day! Do this! Do that! I don't have ten minutes privacy with my husband! We can't even have a fight! We don't have no privacy! Everybody's miserable in our house!
Sure, sure.
Waddaya talking about?!!
You talked to Walt?
Just use common sense. Your job is preventing sin, and the way to do that is give him your best Cross Action.
Just one for a start.
I have been in this Army a long time. I know just what you guys are up to. But there are limits...
Well...  I was going to name you Chief Surgeon...  To consult on both shifts, yours and Frank's.
There's only one way.
No, Ho-Jon, we're not going to open you up.
I don't drink intoxicants.
Same general idea.
When he sees a little running room, he likes to make a show... you know, stutter steps and cross-overs and all that jazz. Also he never learned to button up when he gets hit, so if you two can get a good shot at him once, you can hurt him.
Ayuh, only it's early, I need a drink to wake me up.
Except we forgot one other small thing.
A native is someone who is born in a particular place.
All three of us played for our schools. And there are at least four other guys...
Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker' Jones.
I worked with Spearchucker my first month over here, at the 72nd Evac in Taegu. Most of the colored guys know who he is but they're not talking because he asked them not to.
We got to start rehabilitating, Duke, if we want to be halfway human by the time we get back to our wives.
Screw it. We been earning our keep as respectable knife artists. Why should we do work any pill-rolling punk could handle?
Like the Spearchucker said, that's possible. Anyway, it's been an interesting association.
We're a good team.
Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...
Don't stop now! Please...
I can't... couldn't.
What?
Right.
I'm impressed, Pierce. Naturally, the kind of job I have, I don't get much chance to keep up with what goes on in the OR.
C-A-M-E-M...?
If you don't know what you've seen, why should I?
I like an olive.
The Painless Pole plans to cross the Great Divide tonight and we need your help to straighten him out.
An eternal damnation.
No, no, that one.
But weren't you supposed to meet the surgeons who are going to slice up the Congressman's son?
Beautiful. What do you think? Should we stop and play nine holes now and operate on the kid later? If he's still alive.
Hiya, Ho-Jon. You got a piece of a shell in your chest, but we'll take it out as soon as you've had more blood. Hey, Radar!
How about squeezing him through into Dartmouth? If all he wants to do is catch lobsters, he can learn that here.
On account he got caught in the doctor draft. He was a surgical resident playing semi-pro ball weekends when the Eagles signed him.
He can move in here with us.
I'm glad you feel that way, Major, because you see it's a team effort... doctors, nurses, enlisted men... and I feel responsible for my whole team, and I want you to know I'm satisfied with them.
That's right. We work well together.
It's my name. Maybe that sounds silly to you but...
We may be in trouble, I can't catch my breath. I've got the occupational disease of oversized ex-athletes.
'The Last of the Mohicans.' Only book my father ever read.
You have a certain modest charm yourself.
Ayuh.
Then why not, as long as it wouldn't hurt anybody...?
You're leaving tomorrow?
I'm sorry to hear that. You think he's unfit for military service?
Why would he do that?
Yeah!
Thanks.
The one and only.
That's about the only thing I don't do – that I'm built for. I inspect the girls and take care of some of the kids in the hospital. Sometimes I tend bar and act as bouncer.
Every time we feed him, it either comes right back up or he coughs and turns blue and has a hell of a time.
Just in dreams?
You guys got any black capsules?
You can cut the bow.
That. It's out of the act.
But we strongly suspect something will happen to screw up this splendid organization of yours if you don't get that sky pilot out of our tent.
Christ. All of a sudden it's West Point.
You mean who hit who?
I deeply regret this unfortunate incident. We try to remember we're a military organization.
Yes, sir?
I'm afraid so, Colonel.
Yes, sir, I'll see if I can reach General Hammond in Seoul for you. You think he'll finally break down and give us two more surgeons?
I used to throw the javelin.
Good morning.
Captain...  'This kid' is a prisoner of war.
Colonel Merrill is a veteran of twenty- five years in the Regular Army, a soldier first and a doctor second. A member of several patriotic organizations, he believes it's America's God-given mission to maintain a foothold for freedom on the Asian mainland.
No, we had a clear soup to start. This is a thick one and you ought to taste it. There's nothing like it back home.
Oh, I get the idea. Yeah, maybe.
He likes you well enough to stick around.
Um-hum.
Why can't you call right, you bone- headed, pig-eared, lop-eared, pot- bellied—
John Doe Clubs? What for?
Look, it started as a circulation stunt, didn't it?
About me?
You were? I thought you were chasing me?
I don't know. About three hundred thousand.
John, please let me go with you! Please, John!
How do you do.
All right, but present it to him as a great cause for the common man.
Oh, yes you will, Ann dear . . . you're very clever.
Your purse. I need ten dollars.
Do you mean the speech you're writing?
Darling, there are so many complaining political speeches. People are tired of hearing nothing but doom and despair on the radio. If you're going to have him say anything, why don't you let him say something simple and real, something with hope in it? If your father were alive, he'd know what to say.
You bet I will, Ma.
I remember, distinctly, being fired.
Oh!
John Doe.
Well, you're catching on.
He's perfect! A baseball player. What could be more American!
We'll clean him up and put him in a hotel room—under bodyguards. We'll make a mystery out of him.  Did you speak to Mr. Norton?
Oh, swell! Is that the contract? 
Thank you.
Trying to improve the world by jumping off buildings. You couldn't improve the world if the building jumped on you!
No.
Oh, let me go, will you!
Her old man was Doc Mitchell. You know, the doc that saved my mother's life and wouldn't take any money for it? You remember that? Okay, boss, I'll go and look for her.
What?
Take charge of him. Get him a suite at the Imperial and hire some bodyguards.
. . . Tubby?
And let me tell you, Long John. When you become a guy with a bank account, they got you.  Yes sir, they got you!
Hey. Who'd you say was gonna get him?
A gag. A gag!
You ain't gonna get me to stay here.
Sure. I remember . . . Say, did your ears pop coming up in the elevator? Mine did.
You betcha.
Yeah?  Say, you're sold on the John Doe idea, aren't you?
Nobody's gonna do that, Mr. Connell. They can't use the John Doe Clubs for politics. That's the main idea.
How?
Willoughby. John Willoughby, Long John Willoughby they called me in baseball.
No you won't! You're through deciding anything!
Let go of me!  This man had no intention of jumping off of the top of a building! He was paid to say so!  Do you deny that?
And what about the suicide note? You didn't write that, either!
There! You see? He admits it! You're a fake, John Doe! And for what you've done to all these good people—they ought to run you out of the country—and I hope they do it!
You mean you'd like me to do it, huh?
Yeah.
Oh, n-no, sir. The sea-gull is a lovely bird.
He's never offed anybody. His rap doesn't show any violence.
We don't know how much time we have. If I can get in to talk to him -- maybe we won't lose anyone.
You worried about me, too? The chief's worried about me. Solis is worried about me. Maybe you guys should start some kind of organization.
You want me to go up with you?
What happened, Mike.
I got a couple thousand bucks. You could leave town.
Nobody knows who you are. Make it look like a robbery.
They want Walter dead!
Tell him what, what do you want me to tell him?
Is that where you're family lives?
Absolutely. Bank robbers are generally your smartest criminals.
Johnny Hawkins. Bail Bonds. I gotta be over at county in fifteen minutes, alright?
Is there a problem?
I what?
...a car.
...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes...
Yep.
What if you and me got into a struggle... and my gun went off?
Sorry... Habit.
A little exercise in lateral thinking. The obvious solution isn't always the only solution... See you tomorrow.
Why? You like my ass?
I don't gamble.
You living together?
Around. Barnett's tough competition.
So what do I say to this guy?
Yes.
So why would you hesitate to lie to save lives?
Okay, stop.
A dirtbag behind the counter holding a sawed-off. A Berretta nine millimeter in his belt. A female hostage, red dress, on the floor in front of the cereal display. Male hostage, jeans and blue checked shirt, three feet to her right. Another male hostage, white pants, green shirt, Nikes, laying in front of the magazine rack. A female dirtbag with a gun under her shirt, sitting against the beer cooler, trying to pass herself off as a hostage, and there's a special on toilet-paper, four for a buck twenty-nine.
I don't know why she'd pick him over you.
Still needs work.
Police corruption. It's everywhere.
I don't know, but I've got to get on there.
Pull up alongside.
I thought I could do it. I was so damn sure of myself. But I didn't know what to say. The words wouldn't come. My mouth turned to mush. You make it look so easy, Roper. But it is not. It's not easy.  It's a different job than looking through the rifle scope.
I look at it as how many I've saved. That's the way you've got to look at it.
You've got to decide that for yourself.
Husband came home. Found that guy and his wife "in flagrante". Now he's holding her at knife point.
Doing what? Cleaning toilets?
Really?! He's a wonderful guy. He makes two million a year, and he worships me.
You worship yourself.
Oh, I've got to get a shot of this.
Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy.
You heard.
Don't try to make me feel guilty. The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. I can't do it. I can't be more than your friend. Because I know what will happen. In a few weeks you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me out just as soon as you don't need me again.
It's very nice.
And you think he'll...
Hmm?
Things have been going pretty well between us, haven't they?
You've changed you know. I don't think there's anything you can't do once you put your mind to it.
Cozy Girl in front by a neck... Now a head...
Depends. What's up?
Your concern is heartwarming.
Hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise. Get a car of your own.
Impound isn't a rent-a-car company.
We've only seen and talked to one suspect. He calls himself "Joe". There's two jewelers, two salespeople, the manager, a security guard, and an elderly woman. This particular store is where they do a lot of jewelry making and repair. They have anywhere from 8 to 10 million in raw stones on any given day, so they sure as shit didn't just wander in. They knew what they were coming for.
Halden, how nice to hear your voice.
I have found in life that what one wants isn't nearly as important as what one needs.
No, she said she had a son.  In a dream she once called life.
There you are, sitting next to the creator, what do you say?
I'm serious, how did you know my name?
Guests?
Nothing, go back to sleep.
Yes.
-- He will.
New York.
Take care?  Where the hell are you going --
Someone sends the kid a copy of the access program, then runs the maze at the same time the kid does, using the same codes.
You've got the keys, send someone in --
Listen to yourself.  Digitization.  You know that officially that's a pure fantasy --
The truth.
Then where is she?
Where?
If she's alive, you get it back.
-- You told me.
Who are you?!
Her?
Once they digitized you, they added it.
I know.
Of course you do.  And the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
Just like that?
Resurrection.
Male.
What?!
They're called squirbs.
Now tell me... what do you see?
Activating Power Beam!
The chamber has been accidently UNCOVERED!  You must return it to the depths. or  anyone should open it and Ivan is released!
Use extreme caution, Rangers. You are dealing with an evil here that is beyond ALL comprehension.
Where did it originate?
Close.  Billy, you are the Wolf, cunning and swift.
We can take these guys!
Release the power with the power.
GIVE IT EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT!
THERE'S THE COMET!
Ultra Ninja Megazord complete!
LET'S FLY!
WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!!
A stellar idea, Skull.
A real shame.
BULK!!
The legend goes that you release the power with the power.
How about Major Moron?
Ah, the old and doddering.  I'm going to SCOURGE their puny minds, reducing them to ZOMBIE'S. And then I'll put them to work rebuilding my empire.
GO IVAN!!
So they've been destroyed?
Feast your eyes upon the exoskeleton of the barbaric HORNITOR!  KEEP DIGGING.  THE DREADFUL SCORPITRON SHOULD BE CLOSE BY.  ONCE I HAVE MY ECTO-MORPHICON MACHINES UP AND RUNNING, I SHALL ANNIHILATE ANGEL GROVE... AND THEN... THE WORLD
I ain't no fuckin' kike!
And I ain't no nigger either!
You've got the public upset, Al.
Maybe. But he'd still be the Boss.
Got the same problem with my pop -- garlic. Nothin' you can do.
Scared.
Could we step outside?
You havin' any luck findin' out who did him?
Who hired the bastard?
Long as Charlie says.
That ain't what your mama said.
Why ya always gotta go lookin' for a gift in the mouth of the horse?
I'm already late.
It always is.
I don't care what anybody calls me, Joe. Long as it ain't to dirty. And if you fellas get together every year and say, "Charlie, we still want you to run things for us", I ain't gonna insult ya by sayin' no.
And maybe that's why he ended up dead in the streets of Rome.
So what is the problem?
I'm supposed to be at my old man's for Christmas dinner at eight.
No. We ain't even...
And if we don't invite Maranzano, we can't invite Masseria. Guys don't wanna be choosin' sides.
So we end up with everybody but the two Bosses, at our meet. We ain't sayin' we're the leaders, but we're leadin'.
It's not myself I'm worried about.
I told you twenty!
Yeah. Yeah. I bet ya feed Maranzano that same line.
Whatta ya mean, Boss?
You tryin' ta tell me something? I don't come to a meet with a weapon unless it's with an enemy.
Never threaten me, Boss.
Calculated risks. But Boss, this one don't calculate.
So he can talk to all the families behind your back? Maybe have his own meet at 3:00 AM under the goddamn boardwalk? No. You're too smart for a sucker play.
I got partners.
And the Jews?
I'll take care of the Boss.
You're fuckin' crazy. You're all fuckin' crazy!
You and me both. Sal-va-to-re.
The guy doin' the job names the price. If you don't like it, you can kill Masseria yourself.
I turned him down flat.
That's just what I'm sick of. Everybody lookin' ta knock somebody off! Greedy for what you got. A bunch of fuckin' hogs at the trough.
We can't sell out to those guys. They ain't businessmen!
Kill them! Kill them!
That a Jew compliment?
Awww... deep down I'm a bastard, but when ya got eight kids ya can't make enemies.
Left-handed, he was <u>funny</u>. He'd been doing all this scary, intense work...then he found out he could draw this stuff, and make me laugh, and he liked that. <i></i> And then the nightmares just...stopped.
Stu Miley.
Sad commentary, huh?
It's irregular, but...I just love that strip of yours. I figure I'll take the "Family Circus" guy instead.
Thank me next time you see me.
Do you know what kind of opportunity you have here? You gotta <u>strike</u>. I'm talking mansions. Lamborghinis. Champagne for mouthwash when you brush your teeth!
My life was totally crappy, Herb, and she... fixed it. She made me happy. Which I'd never been. She loves me the way I am - <u>right now</u>. <i></i> I don't want everything to change. I don't want her saying yes to some big success. I just want her saying yes to me.
Farewell? You mean - you mean I'm -
Oh, right. Cheating Death. There's <u>one thing</u> you might try. Only one guy in <u>history</u> ever pulled it off. Well, actually two. Actually, no, there was that other guy who...well, <u>very few people</u> have done it.
Home sweet home, huh? Actually, I was expecting something a little swankier. How much loot does old Stu rake in, anyway?
Baby? Why don't you just...rest on the sofa for a minute. I'll be right back.
Stu, are you...feeling okay?
It looks so...<u>new</u>.
That was <u>especially</u> Monkeybone. Come on, Doc, I don't want to be stuck here with this bunch of media creeps. I just want to be <u>us</u>. Home. Alone! <i></i> I have something I have to give you.
It was great, baby. Let's get you to the ER.
I'm fine, Kimmy. Fine.
This is hard for me, Julie...very hard...but it's been three months now, and... <i></i> I gave the order.
Listen to me! Is there any way I can <u>warn</u> her what Monkeybone is up to??
You can't do this! You'll get in trouble!
Aw, come on. You know you love me. You're a masochistic pain freak. You <u>gotta</u> love me.
<u>What</u> union?
Sorry, Kitty! I'll be right back after I choke my monkey.
Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.
Like you'd know. You started out on the back of a napkin, you little...<u>doodle</u>.
All right. You can come.
What happened?  Did you lose your keys?
Yeah, sure, no problem, you're welcome.
I've never had any problem with them. People say it's the safest block in the East Village.  I just hope their motorcycles don't keep you up at night.
Oh, it's so nice to meet you.
I'm sorry.
I can make my own decisions.
What does he do?
Are you sure you got my bag in?
Moscow.
Oh, yeah ... yeah ... it's a hellhole.
This way?
Uh-huh. And where's the Press Galery?
Oh, yes--they're fine people--regular people.
Those busts up there--all around the wall--who are they, sonny?
Here--let me give you a Boy Ranger button.
Looks like it, but--
I'll brain that guy! Well--call Paine-- call Saunders--
Shut up, Diz.
Yeah.
Tonight?
Tunnel?
Well, let's get going.
We're gonna get married.
What?
Okay--I mean--
You said it!
You don't think he'd want *me* within fifty miles, do you?--after the exhibition he saw me give! Did you see his *face*--?
I'll bear that in mind... What? Oh. Dinner. Pet--my stomach couldn't hold a bird seed.
Well, your children are very bright-- and *they* say Jefferson Smith.
Jim--if I fling a party man like Horace in the face of those angry committees--
Listen--the simpleton of all time--a big-eyed patriot--knows Washington and Lincoln by heart--stood at attention in the Governor's presence-- collects stray boys and cats--
Henry Hill.
I *won't* let you stand there callously and perhaps wreck my whole political future!
Me! Jim--how--?
Aw--
What stuff?
Than what?
Excellent! Excellent! My boy, I'm convinced our State has a great debt of gratitude to you--
Yeah, for the fifth time, Senator-- Washington.
The porter's got them. They're coming.
Well, that ends that crisis. This way, Senator.
I am about to ask for a roll call on the passage of the Resolution--without further delay. The Senator can have nothing to say at this time that would not be either in bad grace or--
Even to the hat. Same old dreamer, too. One look at you and I can see him, back of his old roll top desk, hat and all, getting out his paper. Always kept his hat on his head so as to be ready to do battle. Clayton Smith, editor and publisher, and champion of lost causes.
His last fight was his best, Jeff. He and his little four-page paper against that mining syndicate and all to defend the right of one small miner who stuck to his claim. You know, they tried everything, bribery, intimidation, then--well--
That's all right, my boy--don't bother--
Jeff! You're trying to understand in a moment everything about a project that took two years to set up--the reasons--the benefits--
Will he *yield*?
I will not yield, sir! This same man-- Mister Taylor--came here to offer me a place in this Senate for twenty years, if I would vote for a dam that he knew and *I* knew was a *fraud*! But if I opened my mouth against it, he promised to break me in two! And I stood here one day and tried--I *started* to open my mouth-- and it all came to pass. The long, powerful arm of Mister James Taylor reached right into this sacred chamber and took me by the scruff of the neck--
I *did* see Taylor! And I was in that room!
Well--I'll go to Halifax!
Excuse me for interrupting, Governor, but--  --that plaster's gonna harden any second, son.
How's Amos, Ma?
Well--he's got nothing on me.
You--uh--you better relax, Senator. You'll be plumb wore out.
Well, then, I--I *thank* you, Miss Saunders! Nothing better could have happened--. Yes *sir*, Miss Saunders, we're going right ahead with it!
I said--shall we get started *now* or--
Yes, Senator--*twice*.
Terrible, thank you.
No!
And a beautiful woman, too--don't you think?
No--
Great.
The truth! Well, the man wants the truth! "What *is* truth?" asked so-and-so, and turned away!
If you thought as much of being honest-- as you do of being smart--!
How are the pigeons?
Well! You don't say!
The Senator has no voice in this chamber until the oath of office has been administered!
"So help me God."
You were about to recognize me, sir--
How's that, buddy?
Well--I haven't needed much law so far--what I'd like to get first is a little common sense--
A pet idea--you know--pension bill-- save the buffalo--you've got *one* notion you think would be good for this country, haven't you?
My, my--you sho' are pahwerfully upset, Mister McGann--but you' awfully cute.
A Bill! Not *him*!
Fine thing Jim Taylor wished on me-- show him the monuments--I need this job like I need ten pounds.
Here, I'll take a dozen of those things. Miss Paine.
Yes--a camp bill that will never get beyond a first reading. So calm down, Chick--and--goodnight.
Tomorrow! Joe--he'll hear the section on Willet Dam. He can't be there!
Listen--tomorrow I take him to see monuments--if I have to hit him over the head with a couple!
Susan!
Well, then--this is too much for *my* lame brain. I'm calling Jim Taylor.
Go away, Nosey.
By the way, Mr. McGann just phoned-- in a high fever. Smith's gone again. Have you any idea where?
Well--that's very fine.  Saunders, some person in your office says you've quit--
You're more than that. I've had example of the fact that wild horses couldn't pull confidential matter in these two offices out of you. That's why I tell you what I do--about Smith and this situation. So, you see--
He's lost complete faith in me--
But--you love him, don't you, Saunders?
Jim--if what you say about the future is remotely possible--why not do as I say--drop things like this dam?
Well, then appoint Miller--if you're sure he'll take orders.
Oh, Jim, that's beside the point. This boy's different. He's honest and beside he thinks the world of me. We can't do this to him.
Jim, I won't stand for it.
Jim, you don't have to--
I don't care to meet anybody until I get paid--come on--come on. One dollar each, please, for the Milk Fund.
All right, we'll take Jeff with us--
Listen, Father! "Young Lochinvar smitten with Susan Paine"!
Senator Paine.
It was *I* who rose in this Chamber to accuse him. He is saying that I was carrying out criminal orders on falsified evidence--
Order!
Finally, there was only one answer to a man like him--the truth--which I rose and gave to this body!  Mr. President--he has told lie upon lie--every lie a desperate attempt to conceal his own guilt. And now, he is trying to blackmail this Senate-- as he tried to blackmail me! To prevent his expulsion, he would probably even try to hold up this Deficiency Bill--vital to the whole country--which must be passed immediately--*today*! *Anything*--to force you to clear his bad name and save his hide!  Gentlemen--I--I have no more patience with this--this *rascally* character. I apologize to this body for his appointment--I regret I had ever known him. I--I'm sick and tired of this contemptible young man and I refuse to listen to him any longer! I hope every member of this body feels as I do!
Will Senator Smith yield to his colleague?
Deeds?
Never can tell what he's going to do.
Yes, you own it.
Yes, sir.
Thank you very much.
No! I resigned last week!
Yes!
Yes!
Your Honor, what she is saying has no bearing on the case. I object.
Look, this is my house. I'd like to—
It's wonderful.
You must have met a lot of swell society girls since you've been here. Don't you like them?
I'm from a small town too, you know.
Probably as small as Mandrake Falls.
You have?
I don't blame you.
No. It's nothing.
I can't write it, Mabel! I don't know what's the matter with me.
I'm crucifying him.
Listen, Babe - get me some stuff on this guy, and you can have—
It took some high-powered acting, believe me.
I'm going to tell him the truth.
Oh, as bad as that, huh?
Babe ought to get him drunk again.
Yes, sir.
Miss Dawson on the phone, sir.
Yes, sir.
Perfect! Perfect!
Mr. Cedar!
Sorry, Mac, I can't. Yeah, Mac. Sure, but I ain't the attorney—
See you later, kid.
You can't?
What?
All right.
Why, no.
Buffer?
No, thanks.
That's very kind of you. Are you related to him?
Some other time, Cobb. Some other time.
Arthur wants to quit!
Oh, they insisted on following me.
They'd call you anything if you gave them half a chance. They've got you down as a sap.
No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything.
Listen. Listen, Longfellow. You've got brains, kid. You'll get along swell if you'll only curb your homicidal instincts - and keep your trap shut. Don't talk to anybody! These newshounds are out gunning for you.
Shut up!
They can have the Estate.
Oh Yes, of course - you've just been elected.
I guess it is. But I personally wouldn't care to be head of a business that kept losing money. That wouldn't be common sense. Incidentally, where is the $180,000 coming from?
Me?!
A farmer, eh! You're a moocher, that's what you are! I wouldn't believe you or anybody else on a stack of bibles! You're a moocher like all the rest of them around here, so get out of here!
A child? My uncle's?
That's awful. The poor woman should be taken care of immediately.
Huh?
Well, I play the tuba.
Yes?
Well, I don't know where to begin. There's been so many things said about me that I—
Oh yes, I was getting to that, Your Honor.
I don't know.
Don't pay any attention to her.
I don't care how much it is. You sit right there and eat your lunch. You haven't touched a thing.
Christian Svenson.
Yes, ma'am.
South Dakota north.
Sure. They got on my nerves, so I threw 'em out.
Thank you so much. Good night.
What - tails?  Why, that's a monkey suit![5] Do you want people to laugh at me?  I never wore one of those things in my life.
Excuse me. What did you say?
Every man to his taste, sir.
Well, sir, he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time.
What's that?
Oh, I do too, sir.
Better bring me some coffee, Walter.
What do you mean by coming in here when I'm playing?
Get out.  The evil finger's on you. Get out!
You try it.
No!  What do you want!!
Me more than most.
One hundred books?
What happened?
You must have been concerned.
Take your time.
"There's no shame in getting a little therapy", right, Doc?
Mr. Cook.
What's that?
Sure. Why don't you bring her up to my office at 3 tomorrow afternoon.
Generally that doesn't work out so well. It sends the wrong message to people who need to make a change.
Were you supposed to have a session?
You never got back to me.  ...I called to say we'd like to take you out for a meal?... Kind of a professional welcome.
I don't think you know Dr. Sheeler. She's the other therapist here in town.
I think I've heard of him... a disciple of Rothberg, wasn't he?
As you can imagine, my own feelings about this are mixed... Unlike, I must say, those of my wife.
You came because it's taking over. You're in its grip.
It's a thought I had.
-- Which I don't necessarily agree.
And the experiment is in here?
There's absolutely no reason to think this is going to have any impact on you. I'm embarrassed to have --
Do you want to come in?
I'm not at liberty to say. Sometimes it's just routine, sometimes there's been a complaint. We'll be in touch.
What do you do?
We've been talking about her, mostly.
What do you think's wrong with her?
I do.
I'm sorry you're frustrated.
No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry.
Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.
My patient had to leave early.
Oh, I don't know...
Sure.
You're good.
No, I really don't.
Take a hike, Dr. Quack!
Good evening, Mrs. Cook.
Could I see Sofie, please?
Well, I gotta say, Mrs. Cook, you're right about that.
I don't know what's real and what isn't. That's never been my strong suit. But if you're tired all the time and you've had to give up the life you were having and come back home when you didn't want to... that's worth trying to fix. Maybe I can help you do that.
People usually have to get to know me before they hate me.
Be specific.
Uh-huh.
Did you get headaches before this?  But you get more now? Or more severe?
So the headaches may not even be a part of this?
Yes.
Disgusting.
In the capitol for Boy's Nation. Five days. Why?
That's what I like.
That's... good?
Of course.
Is something wrong, Sofie?
You're upset.
Part of it. We were watching "ER" until someone called.
You're not the only one...
What do you mean, "in no time"?
Weekly or monthly?
Uh-huh.
First off, he tells me to stop smoking cigarettes. I told him abso-fuckin'- lutely no. As you can see --
No again?
He agreed?
Nah... scotch.
Well, you know... that's the thing. Like I said, just about everybody in town works for me. And it's just not the same asking someone to throw a ball when they work for you. It's like an order or something... And no one -- no one -- asks me.
Don't you like this?
Good-looking woman.
Really? I'm the only person I know that likes Danny Ainge, outside of Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix.
Uh-huh.
You are Panda, monarch of modems.
Jerking off?
I can tell you anything else.
That'd be Lily.
Skip, you're a visionary. That can be a burden.
Skip, you know that it's improper -- completely unethical -- for a licensed psychologist to carry on a romantic relationship with one of his patients?
I don't have one really. Most of the time I'm faking it. See, I think there's not much that can be done about most problems... they're too complicated, too deep-rooted by the time I hear about them. The most I can do, usually, is look and listen real closely, try to catch some glimpse of the secret life everybody's got. If I can get a sense of that, well then, maybe... just maybe, I can help them out a little.
Are we talkin, about the same creature? The walking corpse? Really big mouth? Really bad breath?
None of the above, thank you.
So you're the one leading the Americans, I shoulda figured. So what's the scam? You get 'em out in the middle of the desert then leave 'em to rot?
I've had worse.
Why do you like to fight so much?
You left me! You left me in the desert to rot.
Yeah, well, we all got our little problems today don't we?
What does he want the book for?
Intestines.
What is he doing here?
Correct, And that's when --
I did not know, so when I heard you were coming, I asked him that myself.
I would pay one hundred pounds just to see him hang.
What are you doing here?
I just decked your brother
What did you find? What did you see?
If you call that a kiss.
Ahmar is Ossirion. "Passageway to the underworld", actually.
I know my treasure.
Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling?
Not unless you call me Rick.
Gee, yeah, you told me it was the best time you ever had.
The ten plagues?... You mean all ten plagues.
There goes that belief again. Not me, I am outta here!
The creature!? Are you sure!?
What?... Oh yeah, that was just um, you know, figure a speech.
Jealous? You kiddin' me? Did you see that guy's face?
Picked his pocket, actually.
Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he may be a cowboy, but his word is his word.
You have got to be joking?
Of course.
I guess you know just about everything, don't you, Lance?
Except for one little thing.
That I've hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk.
The Inscrutable Six?
Me, too.
They'll think we're just a bunch of weirdoes.
Sure.
It doesn't matter what we call ourselves. We know who we are.
He's dead.
Get on to yourself!
Captain who?
Why not?
Me.
I saw him walk you home.
Date?
Why?
It is?
I wouldn't mind being famous.
Are you nuts? Get out of there!
What are you talking about?
Good or evil, what's the difference?
The wise snake coils before he strikes.
When are you going to take off that mask?
We had an off night, that's all.
How could I see him if he's invisible?
He's got the fact that he's Superman!
But I just don't feel it.
Okay, you win. I'm pissed off. I'm seriously peeved.
What a jerk -- and like nobody knows who he really is!
There's a vague similarity.
But look at him... and look at us.
Come on.
Yes.
No.
Not yet.
And these are my associates, the Shoveler.
Ow.
Of course. I'm such a fool... Thanks, Mummy.
Mother... it's not what you think!
Jeffrey... this is wonderful.
This looks like a job for Superman --
Or both.
And this has been a pretty nice place to live ever since.
But, Your Majesty, the very substance of the Tilsit treaty was that you should join the Continental Blockade, boycott English goods, suspend all commercial dealings with her, and be France's ally.  Nothing more is being asked than to comply with the treaty.
I am in no position to debate this with you, Your Majesty, but can you imagine what a blow it will be to the Emperor if you should now desert his cause?  It would mean nothing less than victory for England.
I have no doubt that he has, Your Majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose?
General Kutusov, I would like to call a meeting of my cabinet tomorrow morning and have you present this idea to them.  I think it has merit and is worthy of consideration.
And, what a delightful idea!
I think it's absolutely charming.
Ah, my dear Napoleon, sometimes I feel that I am not really an Emperor as you are.
I did, sir.
Any cannon?
You could have them here by daybreak.
I'm not insulted.
They are at the gates of Paris, sire.
But who made this treaty?
What cowardice!  What treason! Joseph has ruined everything.  How could they all lose their heads. They knew I was coming up fast. Victory was just within grasp. Come, come, turn your troops around, General Belliard.
That is incredible.
Yes, sire?
Yes, sir.
No, sir, none at all.
That's a nice city.  This is your first time here, isn't it?
Four o'clock.
At first, it hardly seemed more than a routine fire.
Our troops have no part in this.  It has been started by the Russians!
We have already captured a dozen incendiaries, convicts, released just two days ago.  They said they were acting under orders of the secret police.
But, my dear Duroc, how can I act without guidance from Vienna?  I haven't the slightest idea of how the Emperor Francis might feel about this.
I believe you issued an order that all citizens of Paris must hand over any weapons that they have in their possession.
This morning, a Lieutenant and three soldiers came to our house and asked if we had weapons.  I explained we had only my late father's sword, which, in fact, was not a weapon but only a keepsake of memory.
Yes -- an excellent idea.
I very much doubt that he will.
Oh, I'm sorry about that.
Lisette.
Lisette La Croix.
Please, sir, come into bed or I shall die of a chill.
To Citizen General Bonaparte from one who does not wish to see him dishonored by his wife.  You should know, Citizen General, that your wife has taken a lover, one Captain Hippolyte Charles... undated and unsigned.
No...
And you, Junot?
I have no idea.  Her maid said she left two days ago, to meet me -- I can imagine where she is.  But when she finally does come home, she will find her things in the street and my door locked.
No.
Open the door.  It's me.
Yes, yes, please sit down.  I will be with you in a moment.
I gave it to Berthier... this afternoon.
Now, just a minute.  You have just very clearly implied that there is a reason why Joseph should not give my wife the money which I left for her. I can't possibly allow a remark like that to go without explanation.
You know that... letter you showed me in Milan -- the one about Hippolyte Charles?
Yes, I wrote it.
About Hippolyte Charles.
Yes?
Yes.
No.
Does she deserve anything better?
Yes, he has.
Alexander and I are friends.  We have reached an understanding.
You may save your philosophy for the magistrate, Monsieur Varlac.  I am only a simple officer in the army, and to me what you have done is called murder, and his always been called murder by honest men.
A message from Citizen Fouche.
It will scarcely be considered credible, perhaps, but our whole business consisted in eating cherries together.
Duroc, I have a bill here for 600,000 francs from Tirot, for building the Imperial throne and six decorated arm-chairs.  The amount is absurd -- and, at least twice too much.
If the French army had been commanded at Jena and Auerstadt by a tailor, the King of Prussia would certainly have gained the day.
That's it?
Naw, it ain't like that.
Uncle Elroy, who's that girl by Day-Day's car?
What happen?
You.  Hi, Uncle Willie.
I know, that's when Uncle Elroy cussed out everybody, and threw up in Aunt Faye's backseat.
Joker, he just got out of the pen.  Li'l Joker, he just got out of Youth Authority.  And Baby Joker, he just got out of Juvenile Hall.
Yeah, that's me.  Just a little somethin' somethin' I picked up.
D'Wana brought Baby'D up here.
Out the door and to the left.
Nothing.
Me too.
Wait for what?
I don't know.  Probably next Friday.
Craig and Karla, damn that sound pretty good together.  Where you going?
Better sooner than later.
What are you doing here?
Why didn't she put'em out?
Yeah, I'm cool.  See you later.
Nice house. Didn't expect you to answer. You must be one of those entertainers. What team you play for?
I fell in some mud.  Now hurry up!
Ya'll making me look like a punk.
Yeah, pops!
Nice to meet you?
Okay, sir...but where's the cover?
Bullshit!  I'll go postal in this mothafucka!
Don't worry about it, man.  Get the phone.
You don't wanna know.
Damn nigga, don't Jack the joint.  I didn't even pass it.
This is a knock.
I don't know.
Shhhh!  Roach, shut the fuck up.
He moved out to Rancho Cucamonga with his cousin Day-Day.
Man, we can't ride to Rancho Cucamonga on that.
I don't know the number.
Keep pushing.
Me neither.  How far is Rancho Cucamonga?
Good, let's get out.
Nothing.  What you want?
I don't know.  Suga, go ask Miss Ho Kym if she seen them.
What you doing to my nephew?
Naw, baby, no lovin' tonight.
That's my girl.
I...
One loud scream will bring them in here instantly. You won't get very far. Think it over.
Ah.
It was because I had this...in my pocket
I love it when pistolero's talk of trust.
Don't worry. She's good with kids.
Yes, you will, Mr. Watson.
At one thirty my little girl is dead.
Of course you're invited. You're a big donor to the campaign. They love you.
Do you now, Mr. Watson?
Well, you can trust Eleanor Samara Grant.
You've got to trust me. I'm putting my daughter's life in your hands. She's only six. She's just a little girl. Please, please, trust me.
Nods.
I'm tired. I want to.go now.
What's that? You have to speak up.  I'm a little deaf in this ear. Between that and my wooden leg I'm a mess. Compliments of the United States Army Artillery Corps.
It's my kid. I've got to...to somehow...do right by my little girl.
Yeah, all right, listen...
I'm sorry. You understand I don't mind dying if I could save my daughter. I mean that.
It looks real. I don't know anything about guns.
My daddy is going to be a hero? Like Power Rangers?
You're a big girl, huh?
You' oughta learn to relax. I told you I've got it under control.
Where?
I kill her anyway.
Only you.
What gives?
No.
What'd I say?  What? What? What? What?
Hm!
I'll bet.
When'll the skiff be ready?
Yes! Yes!
Yeah, and ornerier than the rest.
Say what, Walt Spoon!
Sshhh! He's in there.
All to pieces!
You and your gypsies! They been gone a week!
And he killed every last one of 'em!
Icey, I don't want a husband.
There's something else.
Oh, Icey, I'm a sight!
It's a shame!
You ain't leavin' in no hurry if we can help it!
It's for the pick-nick. And you won't get a smidgen of my fudge unless you stay for the pick-nick!
'Cause you're too little.
Once upon a time there was a rich king...  ...and he had him a son and a daughter and they all lived in a castle over in Africa. Well, one day this King got taken away by bad men and before he got took off he told his son to kill anyone that tried to steal their gold, and before long these bad men come back and --
John, don't be mad! Don't be mad! I was just playing with it! I didn't tell no one!
Somewheres. I don't know yet.
We'll steal somethin' to eat.
Ssh...
Up river.
He ain't my Dad.
You ain't my Dad! You won't never be my Dad!
No. No.
You could save him, little bird.
Tell me another secret about my Dad.
All right.
But I swore. I promised John I wouldn't tell.
It is my shame -- my crown of thorns. And I must wear it bravely.
No, Harry! I thought --
Harry, what --
Where's she at?
Them kids!
None of your business, Madam.
The Drugstore?
Now who was this?
Pearl and John.
It's just made her think... her dreams are real...
Oh -- jeez -- Glen! Rod's gone ape!
One two, Freddie's coming for you? No. Rod killed Tina. He's a fruitcake and you know it.
And if you can't do that, you sleep.
No.
Hi.
You got a sane explanation for what he did?
Dad, I want to see Rod Lane.
Just want to talk to him a second.
You don't know he did it.
You know he's dead though, right?
Something like a razor was the weapon, but nothing found on the scene.
Keep your head -- this is a fucking flesh and blood killer we're talking about.
It wasn't that serious...
I'll sleep in study hall, promise. I'd rather keep busy, you know?
Nancy?
I don't think you're going crazy -- and stop drinking that damn coffee!
I threw that filthy thing away -- I don't know what you're trying to prove with it, but --
S'curity.
Go on...
They say you've bottomed out when you can't remember the night before.  No more drinking, Baby, suddenly I just don't feel like it any more.
I mean, it was as if there were four razors cutting her at the same time. But invisible razors. She just... opened up...
From Leon!... How is he?... Come, tell us... open it... tell us... how is he?
Well, I've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we'll manage.
Evening gown?
What do you wear in the morning?
Just for the honeymoon.
Right now it's on the balcony.
But what can we do?... We have to accept.
We like you, Leon -- don't we like Leon?
And that's something we owe to Ninotchka.
How many families live here with you?
No, no.
You might get me an accurate map of Paris. I want to use my spare time to inspect the public utilities and make a study of all outstanding technical achievements in the city.
Don't worry... there will be enough.
Well, gentlemen, how about my proposition?
That's all right.
Blue? Let's offset his mood. Find a striped one, and brighten it with a great blaze of tie.
I don't feel like any breakfast.
If you will forgive me, ever since you met that Bolshevik lady I've noticed a distinct change in you, sir.
Emphatically not, sir. The prospect terrifies me. Now, don't misunderstand me, sir, I don't resent your not paying me for the past two months, but the thought that I should split my bank account with you... that you should take half of my life's savings... that is really too much for me.
Yes, General Savitzky?
Good evening, Louis. You seem to be very crowded tonight. Can you manage a table near the floor?
Thank you, Louis.
We avoided luxury and extravagance and today... well, if you were to offer us a glass of champagne, we wouldn't say no.
Razinin.
No, no.
Two thousand francs.
Just looking around.
She doesn't leave her room! She has been locked in for the last two days with lawyers and law books!
We can't... but you are so ingenious, Leon...
And it's great! Think what it was a few years ago and what it is now.
That kind of propaganda is bad anywhere, but inciting the attendants of a powder room to go on strike.... Well, if she succeeds the consequences will be disastrous.
Count Leon d'Algout... a count!... a nobleman!
You're going to force us... huh?
It's not the structure but the spirit which dwells within. There are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality.
No, though the mere thought makes my mouth water.
Ninotchka, do you like me just a little bit?
What can I possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you?
You're the most improbable creature I've ever met in my life, Ninotchka, Ninotchka...
It's twelve o'clock.
That's the way a clock works. There's nothing wonderful about it. You merely feel you must put yourself in a romantic mood to add to your exhilaration.
It's false sentimentality.
The telephone is ringing.
Ninotchka, or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova...
Your tactics are useless. My name is neither Buljanoff, Iranoff, nor Kopalski.
Why?
Then you should go back to your table.
Yes.
Foolish? If this dress were to walk down the boulevard all by itself I would follow it from one end of Paris to the other, and when I caught up with it I would say, "Just a moment, you charming little dress, I want you to meet Ninotchka... you two were meant for each other." Ninotchka feels more comfortable.
A wonderful idea! Radio or records?
And General Savitzky.
You just made that trip from goats to grapes a little too fast.
Darling, darling... please!
Comrades! Good people of France!
No speech?
I love you, my little Leonitchka!
All right, we'll make it red.
It's a little box that you buy on the installment plan and before you tune it in they tell you they have a new model.
No, no music.
...but big.
Who cried that one?
You'd be surprised how many nice people dine with the Guizots.
Now listen, Swana... I sold Monsieur Guizot the idea of publishing your memoirs in the Gazette Parisienne. "The Life and Loves of the Grand Duchess Swana of Russia"!
I understand how you feel, but there is a limit to everything, particularly pride and dignity. They are willing to pay any price! They have a circulation of two million!
Yes, I'm your little Volga boatman.
Oh, yes.
What does he say?
Huh?
No.
Timeless. When she comes into a room you'd think that the Bolsheviks had taken over Paris. She wears her cheap miserable blouse as though it were the latest model by Schiaparelli. What a woman! What a woman! There is a Russian snowstorm in each of her eyes.
No thanks, Swana.
I know you hate the obvious but do you mind if, at this moment, I'm not in the least subtle?
It must be serious, Swana. Not long ago I'd have considered such a statement rather juvenile and rather middle class. Now I can say it without stammering, without a blush. I'm in love, Swana.
Do you expect me to believe that?
Just in case they don't give you your visa to Russia I want you to know that I have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little château in the Touraine, and if you feel the need of a change...
Please come to the point. What is it you want?
In that case I can only say good-by.
That's not the way to win him back... not Leon.
What do you want?
That's no business... that's a social injustice.
Yes.
May I ask why?
That also is a question of food, madame. I'll bring you a nice little lunch à la Père Mathieu. 
But sir, we'll have to start over from the beginning.  We don't have the staff to ...
That's Helms.  He's "sang froid," a world-class poker player.
Uh huh ...
I mean, who the hell cares about this penny-ante shit.  Goldwater put it right.  He said: "Well for Christ's sake, everybody bugs everybody else; we know that." ... It's the cover-up, not the deed that's really bad here.  If only Mitchell could step up and take the brunt of it; give them the hors d'oeuvre and maybe they won't come back for the main course.  That's the tragedy of all this.  Mitchell's going to get it in the neck anyway. It's time he assumed some responsibility.
Good.  You know how I feel about loyalty.  I'm not going to let any of my people go to jail.  That I promise you.  The important thing is to keep this away from Haldeman and Ehrlichman. I'm trusting you to do that, John.  I have complete confidence in you.
That's not the question, John.  The question is: Why is he paying?
John, sooner or later -- sooner, I think -- you are going to learn the lesson that has been learned by everyone who has ever gotten close to Richard Nixon.  That he's the darkness reaching out for the darkness.  And eventually, it's either you or him. Look at the landscape of his life and you'll see a boneyard.
I figured that out.
Well, he's photogenic.  Let's try dog bones?
Is it legal?  I mean has anyone ever done it before?
He wants money.
Uh, we've never done this before, sir ... How do we pay?  In ... hundreds?  Do you fill a black bag full of unmarked bills?
Forget it.  Ehrenberg's paid three times that much ...
Mr. Hoover was a realist.
'Night, Al.
That's what they're doing.
A dozen?  I got half of 'em elected. I still got the South and Goldwater and his boys.  I'll take my chances with the Senate.
It's totally out of context.  I was protecting the national security.  I never intended --
Lincoln used it.
It was just a fishing expedition. Apparently it was their fourth attempt at the DNC.
It's possible they were looking for evidence of an illegal Howard Hughes donation to the Democrats, so the Democrats couldn't make an issue of your Hughes money.
What's Liddy got?
No, keep Trini out of this. Chotiner's too old.  And for God's sake, keep Colson out.  It's time to baptize our young counsel.  That means Dean can never talk about it.  Attorney-client privilege.  Get to it.  And Dean -- you stay close on this.
You approved that before the fact, because I went over it with you.  But ...
That's right, and it's more a problem for Ehrlichman.  He fixed Hunt up with the phony CIA ID's, but ... what else does Hunt have on us?
Sir?
He's treading water.  Don't mention Khrushchev.
So?  You wanted Castro dead. Everybody wanted Castro dead.  If Hunt and the others are CIA, why don't we just throw this back in the CIA's lap? Let Richard Helms take the fall?
Because he didn't even know about it. The CIA never told him, they just kept it going.  It was like ... it had a life of its own.  Like ... a kind of "beast" that doesn't even know it exists.  It just eats people when it doesn't need 'em anymore.  Two days after the Bay of Pigs, Kennedy called me in.  He reamed my ass ...
They had us bugged.  Christ, he had everybody bugged.  Yeah, he was gonna support me in '68, but he was also threatening me.  That was Hoover: he'd give you the carrot, but he'd make damn sure the stick went right up your ass.
Money.  Follow the money.
I tell you, the soldiers were provoked.  Now stop this pussyfooting around.  Dead kids!  How the hell did we ever give the Democrats a weapon like this?  I mean, if Cambodia doesn't work, we'll bomb Hanoi if we have to.
Probably flunking, nothing to do except come down here and meet girls. Henry's out there with them.
Right.  They don't trust!  They don't trust America!
It's Helms -- it's got to be.
For God's sake, when does this end?!
Sir ... six bodies.
No, no!  Please, don't.  Don't tell him.  I'll never do it again.  I promise.  I promise ...  Please, mama ...
Is it my turn?
My friends call me "Mister President."
I didn't choose him as my deputy, Mr. President.  You did.
You're correct.  I'm concerned these students are being funded by foreign interests, whether they know it or not.  The FBI is worthless in this area.  I want your full concentration on this matter ...
Then find something.  And I want these leaks stopped.  Jack fucking Anderson, the New York Times, the State Department -- I want to know who's talking to them.
Well, we'll lodge a formal protest.
My job, unpleasant sometimes, is to know what others don't want me to know.
It is not my practice to spy on the president.  Doctor Kissinger manages to convey his innermost secrets to the world at large on his own.
... But it has never been the policy of this government to accept that. And it is certainly not CIA policy.
Is that why you and Kissinger are negotiating with the Chinese?
Cuba would be a small price to pay.
You asked if you could count on my support ... As long as I can count on yours.
He's obsessed with his own image.  He wants his Nobel Peace Prize a little too much.  As the late "Doctor" King proved -- even an ape can win a prize with good press.
No one.  Your property.  It would prove your case.  Why do you think Kissinger's taping your calls?  For history.  His word against yours -- and right now he's got the records.
We're gonna be plumbers, Frank.  We're gonna plug a leak.
Dick, these boys want you to run.  They're serious.  They can deliver the South and they can put Texas in your column.  That would've done it in '60.
That sonofabitch Kennedy is coming back down here tomorrow.  Dick, we're willing to put up a shitpot fulla money to get rid of him -- more money'n you ever dreamed of.
It's me or Wallace, Jack.  Wallace's third party is only going to help McGovern.  I need your support.
There's no other choice.
Jews and Negros don't win elections, Henry.  Better to hang them around the Democrats' necks.
But it must be done; your government is paralyzed.
Fung pi!   I've only managed to change a few things around the city of Beijing.  I want to know your secret.
Yes, Mr. President.
How did he do that?  All those kids ... Why do they hate me so much?
Civil war is always the cruelest kind of war.
Goes to show you all the moolah in the world can't buy you a brain.
Make some money, Dick, prove yourself to the Wall Street crowd and let Goldwater and Rockefeller take the fall against Kennedy.
How do you know that, John?  Did we try?  Are we just giving up like the rest of 'em?  What's Hoover found, for God's sake?
... but it was all we had.
... Any information you have, Edgar. The sonofabitch is not gonna steal from me again!  Can you back me up on this?  Can I count on your support?
Ernie Davis.
Oh, I like satin, I like pink ...
I like jazz ...
She must be very attractive.  Would she like an autograph?  She might remember me ... Where's Trini?
Yes, I understand that.
There's a lot more at stake here than what you want.  Or even what I want ...
And we got the "big mo"!  We're back!
No, sir ...
I suppose Castro staged the whole thing just to beat you.
You're ruining us.  If we stay with you, you'll take us down with you.  This isn't political, Dick.  This is our life.
No, I'm not!  I'm finished.
Buddy, look at me ... just look at me. Do you really want me to quit?
Is that the truth?
I don't want them to love me.
Then I'll be there for you.
But they never will, Dick.  No matter how many elections you win, they never will.
Is that adjusted for inflation?  Think of the life Mao's led.  In '52 I called him a monster.  Now he could be our most important ally.  Only Nixon could've done that.
It's not the press that matters. Nixon's wife is proud of him.
I wish I knew.  You're hiding.
Don't be ridiculous!
No ... it's just going to start now ...  If I could just ... If I could just ... sleep.
Lost.
To what?
Hiya, fellow ... What were they?
You lookin' at it. I got to say you look older.
'Predate it.
Most don't.
I'm... discouraged.
Couple hundred on his person. Those hombres would've taken the stash.
I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
Yes, he has some hard bark on him.
Strolls right back into a crime scene. Who would do such a thing? How do you defend against it?
Would you tell me if you had?
These people will kill him, Carla Jean. They won't quit.
Yeah, right. Sheriff, can you give me your word on somethin'?
Yessir. We should a brought wieners.
It could be.
Yessir. But then there's this other. He nods up the ridge away from the highway.
Mm.
I'm hidin' behind you.
I'm ahead of you there.
Wasn't no bullet.
Yessir. Wasn't none.
Sir, I don't want to picture that.
No, that's the only thing I would've looked for. And it sounds like these boys died of natural causes.
Natural to the line of work they was in.
Yes Sheriff.
I can't plan your day.
...I need to sit down.
At the gettin' place.
Well I got  a good one. So they ought to even out. Quit worrying about everthing.
Uh-huh.
Why would I let you do that?
I do know to a certainty. And you know what's going to happen now. You should admit your situation. There would be more dignity in it.
I need you to step out of the car, sir.
Not a bleep.
No me mate.
Just lightin' out for the territories, huh. Brother, I been there... Well...
I don't need to talk to you.
Sixty-nine cent.
Y'all getting any rain up your way?
I was just passin' the time.
Well...
You said that.
You live in that house behind the store?
Everything.
Uh-huh.
The kind with the most poles.
I'm just one person. Don't matter the size of the bed.
You can have the one next to yours if you want. One twenty.  It ain't took.
I got beers in my room.
I know how he found me.
Not any way.
I been immobile.
What did I say?
If I was cuttin' deals, why wouldn't I go deal with this guy Chigurh?
No sir.
No sir.
I was saying that it seems probable that she witnessed the murder, but her memory of it is gone, at least for the time being. I also think you ought to have her stay with someone tonight.  Any idea who Chloe or Lonnie are?
Well, you should find out. She keeps talking about them...
You know, Elden, some people actually read more than just the Classifieds...
I can't... they prefer a more formal presentation. I don't usually go so close to the surface, but I was...
You think a woman did that?!
They no longer live in tepees, Mr. College Graduate.
She said she was in Arizona, did she?
Little place called "Williams," why?
I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police...
I've got a pretty good idea. You're here to kill me, so kill me. You want me to be afraid, but I'm not. I don't care who you are, or why you two killed my husband...
"Thirty-two?"
I don't feel that, no. I just... I'm not really who you think I am.
I can't ask her again -- Nathan, stop it! Jesse, don't take that, hit back! -- I feel terrible, hon.
You sure? Maybe next week we could...
I gotta go make dinner.
Betty! Listen to me! Del is ...
No, Del.
He never told me anything about... that's unbelievable!
I know. Listen, we need to take a time out here. Can we talk seriously for a minute?
Why am I doing this to you? Isn't this what you wanted?
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on a second there, baby. Why do you need one of the new Buicks?
Nothing... it's, ahh, busy here. Look, you don't need a LeSabre to go out with Sue Ann. Take the blue Corsica. I'll see you when I get home.
All right, then. Actually, I'm glad you're going out. I got something going on tonight. Some serious clients, with real potential.
Just knock it off, 'kay? Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new.
Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar, but sweet. I liked your editorial this morning...
It's not really a good time, guys...
Los Angeles, California.
That's horrible!
You mean... George McCord, the actor?
I'm massaging his heart. I saw it done once.
I'm not. I just drove in from Kansas.
I came for love. My fiancé is here.
'David.' That's your guy. So, you staying with him?
Man, that is love.
Oh, I dunno... but just once I wish I'd run into a guy who noticed the Koi before my tits.
Huh? Sure, look in my closet, take any dress you want!  We're still on for tonight, right?
What are you talking about? This bar is packed with professional people!  Everybody says if you're going to get married, this is the spot to meet someone... Luckily, I'm currently off men, so I've got the luxury of not giving a shit.
God, that's awful!
Who?
If you didn't want to do it, you should have said so! Is this about gas money?
This is crazy. I come home, you go to your room. You go in the kitchen, I go to my room. It's stupid.
Oh, it's a charity dinner. The money goes to a good cause, but I don't have anybody to go with...
No, almost never.
You think I'm crazy, Rosa, but you don't know the half of it. My husband was, ahh...
I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't...
There was blood everywhere, Rosa. I saw it, I think I watched the whole thing happen... Oh my God...
I don't think so.  Rosa, I didn't kill Del... they did.
No, you're not. You're a good doctor, Lonnie, but you're not David Ravell. I've made my decision. Now, if you'll excuse me...
You know, it's interesting. The South lost the Civil War, but they still seem to get all the glory.
You're a hundred percent right. They rely on what's-his-name's arm too much...
Oh, yes, with the coffee...
I don't follow...
Are we gonna do business here, or not?
Driving their cars into trees... puking on the sidewalk... stupid shit!
My socks?
Wesley...  Your wife's a very lovely woman. Have I seen her before?
I'm just curious. Can't you give me an example?
That's what I thought.  You better give me another example.
Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are, by their very nature, untrustworthy.
Hell of a way to die.
What 'look'?
Should I kill him now?
They paid us half. They still owe us half...
What the hell's the matter with you?
I dunno... something.  Why is she doing this to me? Why?...
You know, blonde, thin, whatever...
We don't have time to look at a hole in the ground. We can make Vegas in four hours. This one's got to be her.
...but she's, no, Betty's smarter than that. She wouldn't be here for a...
It's to follow my instincts. And my instincts say get the fuck out of Dodge.
Mrs. Blaine? I can tell you right now, without a doubt, that your granddaughter is alive, and did not kill Del Sizemore.
You better believe it.
No, wait... what happened next, Betty?
I'll think about it.
Actually, she was my discovery... just like you.
What are you talking about? Killing's totally natural. It's dying that isn't natural...
David Ravell.
I'm not sure now. She said he used to be over at Loma Vista. I never heard of it.
Oh, yeah... Man, I'd love to find that actor just to see the look on her face, watch her bubble burst in mid-air.
Our pleasure, Big Dan.
Didn't know you'd be bringin' a friend.  Well, he'll have to wait his turn -
How ya been, Wash? Been what, twelve, thirteen year'n?
What about you, Everett? What'd you have in mind when you stoled it in the first place?
Awful sorry I betrayed you fellas; must be my Hogwallop blood.
Fire! I hate fire!
Gopher, Everett?
I thought you said you were innocent a those charges.
Everett, I never figured you for a paterfamilias.
Oh my God!
Honey, it's just - Shutup, Delmar - it's just -
Ain't gonna paddle it; he's gonna kick it real hard.
Well, I believe it's mawva kickin' sichation.
Cain't beat 'em, join 'em.
Enticements a power, wealth, settera.
Vernon T. Waldrip.
That's good, honey.
You said it was in the rolltop desk!
Well, we need that ring.
I don't care if it's ninety thousand.
Pete, the personal rancor reflected in that remark I don't intend to dignify with comment, but I would like to address your general attitude of hopeless negativism. Consider the lilies a the goddamn field, or-hell!- take a look at Delmar here as your paradigm a hope.
...I believe, unless I'm very much mistaken - see, we've been away for several years, uh...
Quitcha babblin' Pete - time to skedaddle.
But... but...
No, this is gonna work! I just gotta get close enough to talk to her. Takin' off with us is got a lot more future in it than marrying a guy named Waldrip.  I'm goddamn bona fide. I've got the answers!
Well that all depends. You boys do Negro songs?
Well, I don't record Negro songs. I'm lookin' for some ol'-timey material.  Why, people just can't get enough of it since we started broadcastin' the 'Pappy O'Daniel Flour Hour', so thanks for stoppin' by, but-
They cut a record in here, few days ago, old-timey harmony thing with a guitar Accump-accump-uh-
But Pappy, they's inter-grated.
Blooey!
Yes, Sir.
Great.
You were out at sea! Hey, guess what? I graduated. I got my degree.
Wha-chu-say, palequero? Short time, long time, only ten dolla.
To fly jets. To be the fastest motherfucker in the world. You gotta come and visit me. I'm only a couple hours away.
From you, pard? Never. Thanks for the graduation present.
Yeah, I know.
I never said any of that!
Maybe we'll be roommates, Seeger, and you'll find out how funny I really am...
Don't lose any sleep over it. I wouldn't mind being the first woman to fly a jet fighter in combat.
The whole world's a jungle, huh, Mayo? Dog eat dog down to the last one, right?
Come over here where I can see you.
A long time ago.
No, sir!
Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private.
Yes, sir!
What are you tired from?
Well, as long as you live in this house, young lady, you live by my rules! You should be dating local boys.
Then you're dumber than I thought! All you'll get from their kind is pregnant!
What do you care? Suppose I was pregnant. Just suppose it. You don't think I'd try to make you do anything you don't want to, do you?
What?
Well, I'll be goddamned.
Don't worry. It grows out about an inch by them.
Great.
Big Sid came in about two and a half seconds, then had the nerve to ask, 'Did you make it, too, sweetheart?'
I haven't made up my mind.
That there isn't one, as of today. I had my period.  I couldn't believe it. He still wanted to marry me.
Of course. I don't want no Okie from Muscogee. I can get that right here in Port Angeles.
Polish. What kind of name is Mayo?
Where are you from, Mayo the Wop?
No, and I'm not looking for one either.
Not me.
To meet interesting people, improve myself. You wouldn't believe the losers we got over in Port Angeles.
Who knows? Guys a lot smarter than me are dropping out like flies.
You're a very pretty girl, Paula.
Where'd you learn to fight like that?
You're better than candy.
I'll get it if you want.
I'll try, but this week we go into survival training, so I can't make any promises.  Well, thanks again for dinner. Thank your mom again for me, will you?
Why'd he do it?
I can't risk it.
Sorry, pard. Wouldn't want you to get an honor violation.
Hey, Sid, thanks.
Not if you make it worth my while. How about free boonies for the duration?
I'm not your folks, man. You love this... Susan?
No, but she's gotta be at least a month late.
But she expects you to marry her?
But it would still be my kid. That's the point.
I don't get it! He's the best candidate in our class! Ask anyone! The best student! The best leader! The best friend to everybody! Couldn't you bend your goddamn standards just a little?
Not with me.  Not with people.
Make her come out.  And when she does, that's when we gotta be careful.  She can't get out of this house.  She can't even think she can get out of this house.  We just keep them here and keep them quiet for forty-five minutes.  And I don't want  Joe Pesci here standing over them with his fat sweaty finger on the trigger.  That's a sure way for us to end up with two dead bodies and little puffs of smoke burning out of our heads up in Greenhaven.  So we're gonna seal the place up.  They wanna hole up in here?  Fine, we'll help 'em.  Make it impossible for them to leave.  Once they come out of that room.
The fuck did you do that for?!
Who's the clown now?  Huh?!  Who's the fucking clown now?!
What do you think?  Get us into that room.
Hurry up, for Christ's sake!
I don't know, she keeps screamin' the same thing over and over.
That's their problem.
You're here with me, you're already on the hook for one.  Buy one, you get the rest for the same price. You know that.
You know how this gotta end.
This was your department, Junior.
That's why the key didn't work, they changed the locks.
She'll call the cops, they'll be here before I get unpacked.
What about us?  What if she has a gun?
A guy shows you a gun, Burnham, and you insult him?  Hey, who's the idiot?  Huh?
I met him at the tables, same as you.  And frankly, I'm grateful we have a little muscle right about now.
Shut up and let me think.
Okay, fuckball, you think.  What are we gonna do?
She lied.  Cops woulda been here by now if she called 'em.  Besides, Junior cut the phones.
Shit!
Everything okay?
I don't get it.
We'd like to come in.
Stop asking me that.  I'm fine.  Who called you?
No ball, kid.
Stop calling it the property, you sound ridiculous.
Reinforced steel core walls.  Buried phone line, completely separate, not connected to the house's main line and never exposed throughout the house's infrastructure or outside the house -- you can call the police; nobody can cut you off. Your own ventilation system, complete with oxygen scrubber, so you've got plenty of fresh air for as long as you like.  And a bank of video monitors --
No fucking way.
How many more do we have after this?
Why?
I don't think so, but I love her album.
The crowd goes wild.
0150.
Little bit.  Yeah.
I don't know, why?
Dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot dot.
"Titanic."
Come on, come on...
On it!
Uh uh.
I'm dizzy and thirsty.
Hey, quit apologizing, you're starting to sound like Grandma. You're not gonna have an attack. Okay?
And they sure ain't from the neighborhood. Figure Sabu's in there?
I have confirmed to you my address, that's all I'm required to by law to do. We have broken no law.
Damn straight...  Let's go check out these Paper Panthers.
Brimmer! Could you come in here please?
Just hold on a god damn minute. I...
I don't know you and I got nothing to say to you.
Shit man. It was... you know spontaneous.
What's with you?
Who fucking cares? You cops killed Cy. And before you bastards kill anyone else, I'll give you your fucking set up. That make you happy??!!
What? So you can shoot me? Call it resisting arrest?
Who's they?
Who? I mean besides the FBI?
Man... fuck you. Why you always bustin' my balls? All that high and mighty militant shit. I ain't doing nothing.
Man, fuck you!!!
Look this is bull...
Yeah, and I'm gonna start by getting on my feet. Working on things from inside the system.
Cy... I ain't even sure.
It's a bit more like how can we help you. Bay Area's become quite a hornet's nest in terms of subversive activities. And... well Mr. Hoover wants to reiterate that the FBI will be happy to assist local authorities in any way we can. On a strictly advisory basis... of course.
Are you finished?
Cut the crap, you've been taking the man's money for years. Now it's time you earned it.
Neither your stomach or your opinion matters here Dorsett... What matters is that Mr. Trafficante and the Bureau have come up with a solution to our Panther Problem. One might say...The Final Solution.
Yeah... then shouldn't this be all of us together.
From what you saw, did Huey Newton start the shooting?
Black people getting uppity, feeding their children breakfast, taking their destiny into their own hands. What's this world coming to?
Get the brothers a beer. Me too while you're at it.  Men? Well we can spare six for security...
Yeah.
I'd hoped I was finished with all that. But... 
But nothing... you do live here don't you?
Maybe...
If you got something to say, say it.
S'alright. I'm sorry too. Shit, I gotta take a leak... Pull over at that gas station.
What are you saying?
Later for that. I'm done either way...
Just come for the food, man. Ain't quite sure what their bag is but...
Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabu's got juice now.
Lord, never thought I'd live to see my boy in prison.
Mom, black folks been praying to God for four hundred years. Maybe it's time we tried something else...
Thank you.
His journals, letters, maps, books...
His victories at Charleston and Camden were perfect, strategically, tactically, logistically.  But he has a weakness.
As do you.
Very well, then.
Let us.  Unless you object, I would like to deem this meeting a formal negotiation and, as such, there are certain customary practices. Perhaps I could explain them to you...
And what are inappropriate levels of hostile attention?
Restrain them from the targeting of civilians, including women and children?
Are you going to meet with him?
Thank you.  How's the spotted one's milk?
Yes.  He seeks a levy of troops and money.
When you have children, I hope you'll understand.
If you're here only for revenge, you're doing a disservice to him as well as yourself.
Flanking riders?
Father?
We're low on salt.  I should go to Pembroke and get some.
She'd say it to me when I picked on Thomas or Nathan.
Where?
I stand corrected.
Thirteen years...
No, thank the Lord.  He's more like his mother.
I begged him to stay in the cover of the trees but he insisted the only way to break Cornwallis was muzzle- to-muzzle.  He spent too many years in the British army.
So now Cornwallis will head north, link up with Clinton and finish off Washington.
Long time.
They're nothing but farmers and you're asking them to try to keep a tiger in their backyard.  They'd be better off letting it move on.
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
Goodbye, Harry.
I heard about your son.  I'm sorry.
Thank you.  Did you finish the upper field?
Quiet.
I'm Ellen Creed and I live at 642 Alden Lane, Dearborn, Michigan.  At least, I used to.
Am I really gonna have my own room?
Yaay!
I will. Come and kiss me.
Well, I thought it was safe--
Fine...except when Mom was airing Gage's diaper rash, he walked away and got into Grampa's study and pooped in Grampa's favorite chair.
I know.
Sure, carnation. Like in that movie you rented, Audrey Rose.
Well, here we are, sitting in my chair. Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow?
I'm sure you're not.
And I'm going to eat his breakfast cereal, too, even though it tastes like boogers. And...and...
Jud, do you remember the name of the student that died on Louis's first day at work? The one that was hit by a car?
The Eat A Peach album. God, they were good before drugs and bad luck caught up with them. Listen to this, Louis.
Nope. The Micmac Indians. What's up ahead is all that's left of their tribal lands.
Aw, you'll be okay. Less than a mile.
Yes.
Is there quicksand?
Why? For God's sake, why?
Your cairn.
Don't worry about that.
What did we do, Jud?
Wouldn't wash?
Wendigo?
Well...a touch of the flu...
Remember.
Did you see his shirt?
Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you?
And Church will be fine.
Safe!  At Port Royal.  With the Royal Navy.
Aye, aye, sir!
And Jack.  And the crew.  Free and unharmed.  If you agree ... then ... I will remain with you.
He didn't waste it.
Say the name, or I slit your throat.
That fool woman took it.  You be careful around her, Jack -- she's pretty enough, she'll steal your heart -- but pure evil inside.
I can't help wondering, Jack, why you're being so helpful and all? Last time you did that, it didn't end well for you.
Aye, for us there is.
By the powers, you're right!  Where's Jack's pistol?  Who's got it?  Bring it forward!
No.  But him I believe.  He us genuinely angry.
Captain Barbossa ... I have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against Port Royal.
I want you to leave.  And never come back.
Elizabeth --  Turner.  I'm a maid in the governor's household. 
Commodore, you can't do that!
And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth, we will be landing in Port Royal soon, and beginning our new lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station?
I'm told that dress is the very latest fashion in London.
To keep it away from them?  No pirate would sail to London, for fear of Execution Dock.
Elizabeth, I think it doesn't matter that we are of a different class --
Me!
The trees are taller.
Not when you can drink instead, at least.
I know a lot of songs about pirates, but none I'd teach a child.  Let's hear it.
To the Black Pearl.
I have a plan.  If it succeeds, then any battle will be decidedly brief ... and one-sided.
Now where, I wonder, would they have gotten that idea?
How did he get off the island?
We're not going to just surrender!
Better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate.
As likely as not.  Will, short up the anchor, we've got ourselves a ship!
No ... somone has to make sure this dock stays off-limits to civilians.
Captain Jack Sparrow.  If you please.
By remembering that I serve others, not only myself.
They left me stranded.  Twice. What have you got to lose?
So's breaking a man out of jail. Face it, Will: you may say you'll never be a pirate, but you're off to a rip-roaring start.  My advice -- smile and enjoy it.
My father -- was not -- a pirate!
Barbossa.
On whether the stories are all true.  If they are, that's a waterfall that spills over at high tide, with a short drop to an underground lagoon.  If not --
My name is Will Turner, the son of Bootstrap Bill Turner.  His blood runs in my veins.  You need my blood.  And on my word I will pull this trigger, and sink all the way down to Davy Jones' Locker!
The Black Pearl is a real ship.
Yes.
If he were telling truth he wouldn't have told us.
Dr. Argon, I demand an explanation.
A light mixture of oxygen, dioxide, and sodium pentothal.  He'll sleep, that's all.
You're lacking a few things too: ethics, morals, common decency and, oh yeah, deodorant.
Yeah, I'm going to finish what you started --
That's right.  And making me was the biggest mistake you ever made!
Icarus, please, if you want me to give you a bath just say so.
Nebbleman.
Why are there two ottomans?
Did I?  I've been waiting for that for years.
Shut up and do it!
You have no idea what this is doing to your body.
What did he want?
That's right.  C.D.C. found out and closed them down...
The replicators?
Who isn't?
I've only been invited to her house once, but I know there is a basement lab that she uses for private research.
And if we evacuate, what do you want to do with O'Brien?
Same old Daniel.
Is that so?
The big house?
Jesus, Daniel.  It wasn't Ryker's Island.  It was work camp for white collar criminals.
That's what I thought.
All I'm saying is that the companies that have money for the kind of research you're interested in, have money because that's what they're interested in!  Money!
Susan, this is the future of America here.
Mouse?  What mouse?
Got it.
What happens?
You're the doctor.
Just giving credit where credit is due.
This is what I deserve for trying to protect the world from a madman and his mercenary physicists?
And I don't see you sunbathing at Chernobyl!
What did you want my hair for?
Forget it, pissboy!  You tell Argon he can call my lawyer.
Oh yeah?
Can I help you, Mrs. Argon?
Yes, he might be.
Oh, thank you, I knew you'd understand.
Well, I tell you, yesterday when I was here, I had one of your books in my hand, and when I got outside, I realized I still had your book in my hand. So as long as I had your book in my hand, I thought I might as well take it home and read it. This morning, I got up and put your book in my hand, and here's your book in your hand.
I know but that was news. This is blackmail and I don't like blackmail.
Yeah, I haven't figured out the plot yet, but it's laid in a Siberian village.
It's all right. It's all right, Anne. I can take a hint. A bit subtle, but I get it. It's all right.
Yeah. Oh, it's great. Of course it doesn't compare with this coliseum of yours here, but 'twill serve m'lady, 'twill serve.  The architecture has a little feeling of Missouri Gothic - and the furniture sort of leans toward Oklahoma Renaissance - with a tiny touch of Grand Rapids.
But we don't need it, I'm sure.
Of course I am Stewart.
Wait a minute. I'll do anything you ask me, Anne, but I will not live—
Honey, I love you. I'll eat spinach for you. I'll go to the dentist twice a year for you. I'll wash behind my ears for you. But I will never wear garters!
Oh, no I won't my dear - oh, no I won't my dear - I'll wash behind my ears, but no I won't my dear!
Didn't I? That's funny. Isn't it funny?
Why, down at the office, we always look at Gallagher as - eh - just Gallagher, that's all.
I poisoned him.
What am I going downstairs and tell those people?
Stewart, would you mind telling me why you're not going?
Are you crazy?
But I don't want to meet your gang.
Good morning. What does this mean?
Why—
I was so worried for fear he'd knock over a vase or something. I must have acted like an idiot.  What does it say about the reception last night?
Mother!
All right, all right! It's your funeral, Anne Schuyler!
Pardon me, Mr. Smith is engaged. We are having a reception here this evening—
Is that so?
But right now I'm acting in the capacity of Mrs. Schuyler's attorney.
I know, I know. But there's no truth in the story whatsoever.
I certainly will.
Couldn't make the last edition. It'd take me four hours to translate your story into English.
Excuse me, Gallagher. I wouldn't miss this one for the world.
The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?
No? Well, where were you when that happened?
Baloney!  Joe! Bring me a special!
Quitting? I'm not thinking about quitting.
My play.
I'm your valet, sir. Dawson is the name, sir.
Oh no, sir!
Miss Schuyler - I mean, Mrs. Smith - she engaged me this morning, sir.
Quite so. Quite.
Now Mr. Smith, now please—
A bird! A bird in a gilded cage! Get that thing out of here!
Yes, of course. Miss Ramsey telephoned me. Well, what would you like to have?
Well!
Sure. I wish you all the luck in the world, pal.
Who - Anne? Sure, Anne would love that.
No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck.
Nothing.
Hello, Stew.
Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.
I don't know a thing about him, but isn't he the one you're always yelling about?
Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now...
And there's her mother - and what a character that old dame would make with her double-strength - and that lawyer friend of theirs - he'd make a great villain - and there's you!
Huh?  Oh, I'm not worrying about her - I'm worrying about that second act curtain, that's all.
Gallagher, that guy just dropped by to give us a great opening for the third act.
Why deny it? The more you deny, the more they print. Let them alone! The thing to do is to sit still and keep our traps shut.
No, I have no idea - unless some of the silver-ware is missing.
Hello, Joe.
The rest of the gang had to get out the morning edition - but they'll be down later.
Are the cars ready?
Why—
With pleasure, Madame!
To engage in a brawl! A cheap, common brawl, in my own home! "I wear the pants!" The pants ! Not even the trousers!
Anne Schuyler, are you going to sit there and watch this man insult us? Haven't you any decency left?
The name is Smythe.
Yes, sir.
How about me?  Do you think if I concentrated and put my whole soul into it, that some day I might be a putterer?
Thanks.
Actually--I'm not real ... hungry.
What?
It can't be possible.
No, I ... I was just ... worried about her.
What?
Sure.
I'm sorry ...
Thanks.
She's crying.
Yes she is.
I don't know.
Yeah. It does.
All night?
Well, sometimes talking's over-rated. Don't you think?
Oh, gosh no.
Oh you bet.  Will you excuse me for a sec?
I think ... I might be ill ...
What are you doing?
What's the matter?
Yeah ... How'd you know?
I don't know what I'd do if she wouldn't go out with me ...
That's not going to happen!
I really don't know.  Ben Miller's son just quit his job as a boxboy at the market.
Oh sure ... You bet.  Betty ...
Rain.
Yes I did.
Because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want.
Well--it was dark out ...
Very well ...
Um ... I don't know how to do that, Bob.
Oh. guess I could do that, then.
Um ... Outside of Pleasantville.
Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.
What's going to happen?
Peggy Jane, Lisa Anne and Betty Jean.
Jen please ...
Nothing.
David, nobody's happy in a Poodle skirt and a sweater set.  You like all this don't you?
Really? It seems so fattening.
It's fine.
Well--did she really like me or were you just making that up.
I told you. I'm like positive.
Oh. Thanks, Margaret.
Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey.
Oh ... Hi.
... Lover's Lane?
They just grow like that?
Sure ...
I like it too.
Right. And how did she dress him?
McGinty's.
My name's David.
Talk about it. Right now, I mean. I got to ... um ...
Re-runs?
Terrific. I'll talk to you then.
It was a gift Bud. It was so special. You liked these things as much as I did, remember: Warm smells in the family kitchen? A smile from a stranger? You know how rare that is?
I'm going to leave now.
Just gimme the damn remote!
I don't know ... Three, four weeks.
Well--I always wipe down the counter and then you set out the napkins and glasses and then I make the french fries ...
I'm so glad you're here.
Why?
Thanks.  But this morning I was thinking about it and I realized that I looked forward to it all year. And then I thought "Gee. That seems awfully silly. That seems like an awfully long time to be waiting for just one moment, don't you think?"
Yeah.
Hi.
I brought you something ... From the library.
I'll never be able to do that.
That's not the reason. I've got a date at six thirty.
Oh sure. Big fan like yourself. It's the least I could do.
Hey it's me, what are you doing?
Yeah but what are you doing?
You just fucking said "chat," that is so -- what are you now? "chat." I'm just calling to make sure you show up at this party tonight.
This is "Fly With Us?"
I think that's a type-o then, that would be a mistake.
That's it.
Ok. Thank you.
I'm just stopping by to say hello.
So you're coming tonight, right?
There's this girl, this friend of mine from work that I think is really cute and really cool and I want you to meet her so I was thinking about bringing her to the party tonight.
I'm not really asking you, I'm telling you.
I'm not being scared, you're just going to rag me if I do this --
I didn't ask him that. He's lying.
OH MY GOD. Look at that.
Call me later.
....she didn't, I didn't ask her out?
......she forgot her purse at my work and I wanted to get it back to her.
There is no reason for you to treat me like you do -- you're killing me, you are killing me with the way that you are towards me --
Hi, is this Jack?
So what are you doing tonight, Jack?
Are your pants off?
What do you mean it doesn't matter?
You have a girlfriend?
Where is she?
I have my own business....I work. I work hard at doing my business.
I do pretty good, I think. I wish I was making more, doing a little bit better. I can,t get over a certain hump. I will...I will crack something soon I think and really do better...I'd like to diversify...but I'm doing great, I think, as a start.
No.
Uhhh...I am sooo tired...I stayed up too late last night, what about you, when did you go to sleep?
Can I ask you a question?
....what....?
This is....illegal....I'll call the police.
This is not cool.
Thank you.
No. Not at all. It's nice.
That's not mine it's one of the guys that works here. That pudding's not mine.
Are you guys hurt?
-- well, if you're gonna go --
-- oh that's too bad, it's so great over there and if you were there we could say hello to each other or something --
Yeah.
....Hi.....
Yeah.
About six months.
Yeah. Yeah we get along well.  You didn't get along with her very well?
I thought you said you bought all that pudding --
Ok.
Did something happen; are you alright?
Ok. Well call me when you get back, I mean, I'll call you when I get back. I'll be back for three weeks and then I go away for a month after that. So maybe in that time....
Yeah.
Thank you.
Lena?
It's Barry.
When was the last time you had a girlfriend?
What's that? What is that that you're doing?
I know what you mean, I know what you mean, I get this feeling --
This is nice.
Yeah.
Can I come home with you when we get there?
If they break or something. What is it, plastic?
Right. Alright, lemme call you first thing tomorrow, I'm gonna run the numbers, see what's what and I'll give you a call back --
It's fine. I can just get you at your office.
.....1274 Moorpark. Sherman Oaks, California. #4. 91403.
What's that for?
I just don't want anyone to know it's me.
No I just....I don't want to, I just want to be connected to talk to a girl.
You are bad. You are a bad person. you are a bad person and you have no right to take people's confidence in your service --
NO. NO. DON'T YOU SAY THAT.
Well I'm sorry. Before...
I don't like the way I am sometimes.  Can you help me? WALTER Barry, I'm a dentist, what kind of help do you think I can give you?
You want a number for a psychiatrist, I can get you one, that's not a problem. but what exactly is wrong?
I'm sorry.
Hey...Lance....can I.....
Yes I'm fine.
I don't know. I think it's a piano....a small piano.
Hi, Lance.
WHICH?
I think I got in trouble. A little bit of trouble....
Ok.
Hi.
Please don't do this.
Is this where you live?
Alright, alright.
You know, please, I just wanna say that I didn't say I would help her out; I was very clear about it....I don't think that this is fair.....wait, wait, wait, ouch, ouch.....
What are you doing?
Are you going to the party tonight?
Right now, you're doing nothing?
What time are you gonna be there?
Seriously.
Yes you do. We were calling you Gay Boy and you got so mad....
Ok.
I'm only paying two of you guys.
Ok.
Once or twice.
I think she's sweet on him, that's what I think.
"...a poker... he took a poker from the fire..."
I've you to look after me, haven't I?
We treat you well enough here, don't we Marquis? Your very own featherbed, in lieu of a straw mat. Your antique writing desk, all the way from LaCoste. Enough quills to feather an ostrich --
Enough to discern its tenor.
But isn't that the duty of art? To elevate us above the beast?
Do I have your word?
How can one man possibly be so selfish?
If you won't be true to your word, then you've left me no choice.
You always do.
Good day, Marquis.
A man after my own heart...
A night spent with the partner of my choice.
Your wig. Remove your wig.
I know, because I felt it myself --
I'm here.
I hope you'll judge him by his progress here, and not his past reputation.
And his writing?
All France is aghast at this book, yet you've not heard of it?
Oh indeed?
That's not our intent --
Enough!
Maybe someday you'll tell me your name.
What of my lips, will you soil them too? When you've broken every other taboo?
You? Frighten me? That's a good one! I'm twice as fast as you are. Who'd have thought such a spent body can still boast such a fertile mind?
Is it awfully violent?
Tortures so arcane, so medieval, even I haven't the words to describe them. If you've an ounce of pity in your heart, you'll throw caution aside, and unlock my door...
It's only been described to me. In your books.
You're far crueler than I, my sweet.
Yes! You shall. Of course you shall --
Something to make the angels weep, and the Saints to gasp for air...
Tell him I'm no fool. A prison's still a prison, even with Chinese silk and chandeliers.
Desperation has driven me past etiquette, all the way to frenzy.
It's tainted money, Doctor.
I'm on the brink of bankruptcy; my husband's resources are all but exhausted. And to what end, I ask you?
Am I a cursed woman, Doctor? Must I be betrayed by every man I meet --
It's libelous; you wouldn't dare.
Very much.
I'd rather read, thank-you.
No, when I was but a tender lad--
Oh, but haven't you heard? I'm the Boy Wonder. I've been a genius since the moment I was born.
Houdini mice.
Mr. Welles certainly is a caution
He needs me here.
My name is Orson Welles
One . . . buys things.
Nailed us, hub? The crazy old man and his whore.
You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need the Tribune to--
I wanted it
Tough shit. We need to t-t-talk about this--
I will not have this in my home.
He looked into my face and told me it wasn't about you.
I can't remember the lines!
Orson, hold on. Look into my eyes. Tell me you are not doing Hearst.
No -- no -- I mean--
Uh-huh
Can I talk to Hearst?
Nonsense
Then you better get ready to be the youngest never- was in Hollywood history.
Sure. Dropped her out of his Lockheed over Utah
The whole joint is half the size of Rhode Island.
Yeah, it's the place God would have built, if he'd had the money.
Okay, boy wonder, what?
Orson. Stop. Just stop
And when he looks up? What does he dream about?
No, AMERICAN is a blessed title directly sent from God's soul to your mind. We shall never change that! I mean the name of the publisher. Charles Foster Craig doesn't have the knives-out poetry I need. I was thinking about "Kane" -- you like that?
K-A-N-E. One strong syllable. Kane I
To my invaluable comrade Drink up!
I don't give a shit about-
Aw, cheer up, George'll probably be running Fox by the morning. Let's get a drink.
Herman.
I, um, need an estimate on some jewelry I might wish to sell. But d-d-discretion is very important to me b-b-because I don't want anyone t-t-to, um, know that--
Yes
Again
Listen, get off your horse with me. You know I've stuck by you since the beginning of time it seems like, while the stockholders in New York were ready to cut and run and everyone else in Hollywood was set to toss me in a rubber room. But your contract stipulates a max budget of 500 thousand. This one's gonna come in at 750 thousand. What do we do about that?
Jesus
They've all seen a rough cut
You're with them, aren't you? You're going to bury my movie. They bought you!
It was a -joke, George
The Palace in New York. But Orson there's something else.
Happy birthday.
Yeah, they're good. They're good, Tommy.
You were a big favorite in this fight. Then two days ago the odds start jumping all over the place until you're a 12-5 underdog.
It's not done.
Hit me in the face.
You heard me, I said hit me.
See that, I don't feel it. I can take it. I know I can take anybody.
You wasn't with her?
I don't like all those other clowns around. That's all I know.
No, but Jake... how much abuse can you take.
You want the title shot?
This Janiro's an up-and-coming fighter, this kid you gotta knock out. Knockout this fuckin' kid! I'm telling you, this is your step towards getting a shot at the title. Listen to me: I'm telling you. You been killin' yourself for three years. There's nobody left -- they're afraid to fight you. This Janiro's up-and- coming. He don't know. Fuckin' tear him apart, wipe him out! What are you worried about? Your weight? Look, even if you lose they're gonna think you're weak; they're gonna think you're not the fighter you used to be. They'll match you with guys they were afraid to match you with before, and then you'll kill them and you'll get your title shot. And if you beat this kid Janiro, they gotta give you a shot at the title because there's nobody else. Either way you win and you do it on your own -- just like you want it. All right?
Didn't you just see her lookin' at him? She told me no, but I don't believe her.
What do you mean?
What did Tommy say?
Ain't a cheek ever good enough for you? I never even kissed Mama on the mouth.
Well, that's what I mean.
No, I just told you what happened.
Don't bullshit me, Joey. You ain't tellin' me the truth.
So, go ahead. Kill everybody. Kill Salvy, kill Vickie, kill Tommy Como, kill me while you're at it. What do I care? You're killing yourself the way you're eating, the way you worry about things you don't have to worry about.
What time is it?
Should I hit it?
Jake, you made me promise not to get you excited.
Nobody. I love you, remember?
What's that kissing on the mouth shit?
I got bored so I went to the movies.
Oh, c'mon. For Christsake, do I have to tell you everything?
What're you talking about?
I am answering...
You're not only an animal, you're a stupid animal.  You're rotten.  Rotten.  Rotten.  You're a sick maniac. A maniac! You belong in a mental hospital.
What do I say to him? Call him up on the phone and say, "Joey, I'm sorry about that little trouble we had. How about havin' dinner?" Is that what I say?
I got a lawyer, Jake. We're getting a divorce. I'm getting custody of the kids.
He should.
Hey but Joey, you're thinking nickels and dimes. The money's with your brother.
Get lost.  Hey kids, "A cop is a rat." Remember that, "A rat."
All right, I'll try. See you later.
Too bad. The Thorwalds were just leaving the apartment house at that time.
Who left -- where?
Doyle -- are you interested in solving a case, or making me look foolish?
What's the matter? Does he have a courtesy card from the police department?
What do you need before you can search -- bloody footsteps leading up to the door?
That depends on who "they" were.
Your Lisa?
A possibility.
You think perhaps it was "old hambone?"
If that ring checks out, we'll give him an escort. So long.
You're too valuable to the magazine for us to play around with. I'll send Morgan or Lambert.
I've been taking pictures so long I don't know how to read anymore.
Can you see me -- rushing home to a hot apartment every night to listen to the automatic laundry, the electric dishwasher, the garbage disposal and a nagging wife.
The word is "everything." Now what time does my plane leave Tuesday?
Who are you?
Then if the police get me -- you won't be around to laugh!
I'm not ready for marriage.
She's all right.
Stella!
Probably. But when I do, it'll be to someone who thinks of life as more than a new dress, a lobster dinner, and the latest scandal. I need a woman who'll go anywhere, do anything, and love it.
There's an intelligent way to approach marriage.
Ask for trouble and you get it. Why there's a good boy in my neighborhood who went with a nice girl across the street for three years. Then he refused to marry her. Why? -- Because she only scored sixty-one on a Look Magazine marriage quiz!
Well, the salesman could be available soon.
No. The shades are still drawn in their apartment.
You called the police?
Uh-uh. The dog. I think I know now why Thorwald killed it.
Then I wouldn't worry too much. But let's keep an eye on her.
There's no point in taking unnecessary chances.  Give me the phone book, Lisa.
When those cops get a look at Miss Fremont -- they'll even contribute.
He knows.  Don't worry, Tess. It's a man.
Yeah -- I want to get this thing off and get moving.
I wish there was one I wanted.
You mean leave the magazine?
Miss Lonely Hearts. At least that's something you'll never have to worry about.
She's not in love with him -- or any of them.
There's nothing I'm hiding. It's just that --
All right. That's your opinion. You're entitled to it, but --
Three.
Jeff, you don't have to be deliberately repulsive just to impress me I'm wrong.
I have one now.
Nothing, thank heaven.
Where's the doctor -- the undertakers?
Maybe he's leaving his wife. I don't know, and I don't care. Lots of people have saws, knives and ropes around their houses. Lots of men don't speak to their wives all day. Lots of wives nag, and men hate them, and trouble starts -- but very, very, very few of them end up in murder -- if that's what you're thinking.
You could see that he did because he had the shades in his apartment up, and walked along the corridor, and the streets and the backyard?
To get on home.
Not yet!
Thinking about Thorwald?
Not a word. He was going to check on the railroad station, and the trunk. He must be still on it.
Do they hide it in their husband's clothes?
That's a suitcase?
You mean -- like the kitchen? And make us some coffee?
Jeff -- if anybody walked in here, I don't think they'd believe what they see.
I think I'll start reviving it tomorrow, with say -- Miss Torso for a start?
No, Lisa -- I don't think he did.
Well, -- if there was one less thread this way --  -- and two less that way --  -- I might give up bachelorhood.
Now hold on. I'm not a bit squeamish about what might be under those flowers -- but I don't care to watch two women end up like that dog --
How?
Think you've got enough for a search warrant now?
Your name?
What's eating you, Judy?  You want him alive?
Give me some dirt.
Good luck, Buzz.
How 'bout you?  Say the word and you're cold, Jack--you're dead.
Jim Stark.
Hang loose.  We got all night.
You make any sandwiches?
You know I never stop you from anything.  Believe me--you're at a wonderful age.  In ten years you'll look back on this and wish you were a kid again.
That's not what I mean.  I've never done anything right.  I've been going around with my head in a sling for years...I don't want to drag you into this but I can't help it.  I don't think I can prove anything by going around pretending I'm tough any more, so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like another.
He's a minor, Mr. Stark, and it looks to me like he had more than a little drink.
Just relax, please relax!
What's that pounding?
Do you hear from him, son?
Well maybe she better start.
Plato.
No.  I don't think so--
What?
I saw it.  Gee, look at that thing swing, will you?  Do you think it never stops?
What's a chickie-run?
Why don't you come home with me?  I mean nobody's home at my house--and I'm not tired, are you?  I don't have many--people I can talk to.
Yeah?
It's wonderful that you understand so well--and so young too!  You know the most wonderful feature about the nursery?
Come on!
When was that?
Who?
Plato!
No.  At dawn.
I promise nothing'll happen if you do.  You want my jacket?  It's warm.
Just tell a little white lie?
No.
I just get so--  Boy, sometimes the temperature goes way up. RAY  Okay.  Okay.  Let it out.
"Life is crushing in on me."
Dig the square wardrobe!
I'm not so bad.
Neither can I.
I felt like it.
See, we're very modern.
I don't know.
I don't know--you just are. Leaving a light for Plato.  That was nice.
Are you?
What?
It's not going to be lonely, Judy. Not for you and not for me.
It is for me too.
We have to go back!
Oh, we can manage that!  I'll scrimp and save and work my fingers to the bone...
Talk to them!  Heavens!
We used to sing it in school.  Don't look at me with such horror. They had schools in those days.
We were romantic then too--
What?
What are you doing here?!
Gabriel!
We're talking, aren't we?
We musta written what, twenty of 'em? And they were before this guy. One, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in Leavenworth --
I got fifty dollars to spend in your store, Jesus of Nazareth. Can you help me or not?
Yeah.
No, hey, I like your coat --
What.
I've been dreaming about that smile, Ashley Mercer. For a long time.
Can't survive on our bodies alone, Nick.  Hurry up!
Yeah, well you wrote me you were six- foot-four, baby.  So don't talk to me about little white lies.
Ash, you've gotten me enough --
Blackjack, Nick, blackjack I am good at. I mean, they'd give us some free games or something, wouldn't they? Since you worked there?
We could live it up and --
Nick...
You're not hearing me here --
Just tell him what you know, Nick! That's all they want! And we'll get out of this!
Is there any way you could get into his truck?
Yeah. That's love.
We still gonna spend Christmas together?
You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe you!
Oh, I know you, Nick. I know you real well.
What?
A station wagon in Canada.
Her brother.
Five million?
Christmas... Eve...
This isn't the Tomahawk.
This is the front entrance, right? You get through the slots, you hit craps here, not blackjack. Blackjack's here to here -- lined up. What's this, the cage? Cage is over there, hard to get to, you got it all mixed around --
And I worked there. For a year.
Might as well be.
You get recognized, convict, You get a country-western funeral.
...ttt..tt... two out of three?
What, we walking in there and delivering toys?
Hey! HEY! THERE IS A POWWOW SAFE!
How'd you know my name was Rudy.
OPEN IT!!!
We understand you, Mr. Bangs.
My guy would walk into a room, set off the goddamn sprinklers.
Fuckin' freezing.
Five years. Since it opened.
He didn't recognize me. Back off, willya? He didn't recognize me.
Fuckin, Zookerman --
What?
I'm just talking.
Thought you hated Sidnaw.
Standing right here, man!
Take it, man! You're all right! Hold it in! GUARD!
You're GONNA be there! We're getting outta here! TAKE IT!
She set them up. All of them.
You gave them me.
Well...sorry...
But... I had a five...
They changed the layout.
I got an idea on that one. Once you're up there, you gotta hold those guards down till some backup can get there. There's a security camera room that videotapes everything. You've gotta destroy every last one of those tapes.
You tried to fuck me in my father's office, you sick bastard. Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do in the privacy of your own home, go do it. But don't try to fuck me. I don't think of you that way. I mean, I like you a lot -
You're coming back to work for us, right?
You ain't dying, he is.
Who?
It makes perfect fuckin' sense to me. Eddie, you didn't see how he acted during the job, we did.
This isn't all that bad. We can give you a lot of legitimate jobs. Put you on the rotation at Long Beach as a dock worker.
Bullshit.
And what are your answers? Was it me? You think I set you up?
I gotta go along with Mr. Pink on this. I've seen it happen.
...What bar?
You ever seen this motherfucker before?
Yeah.
Yeah.
What about?
It's a scene. Memorize it.
You can do some crazy things with it.
Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's parked across the street till I give him the signal, then he pulls up in front of the store.
Sure.
Fuckin' asshole, won't let me leave the halfway house.
Chew? Toby Chew? No.
Whatever. Just throw in your dollar, and let's move.  See what I'm dealing with here. Infants. I'm fuckin' dealin' with infants.
Whaddaya mean, give it to me when we leave, give it back now.
What do you care?
Bad luck. What's the exposure like?
How many employees?
No, they're not.
Mr. Pink.
Freddy Newendyke.
And I'm dying. They don't know that. All they know is they're not to make a move until Joe Cabot shows up. I was sent undercover to get Cabot. You heard 'em, they said he's on his way. Don't pussy out on me now, Marvin. We're just gonna sit here and bleed until Joe Cabot sticks his fuckin' head through that door.
What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't catch it. Would you repeat it?
No, I'm not!
It's not good...
Blonde went crazy. He slashed the cop's face, cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive.
Yeah, it's fuckin' great isn't it?
Oh that's just fucking great! Where's Brown?
Oh this is bad, this is so bad.  Is it bad?
Why not?
I'm telling ya, it wasn't that soon. They didn't let their presence be known until after Mr. Blonde went off. I'm not sayin' they weren't there, I'm sayin' they were there. But they didn't move in till Mr. Blonde became a madman. That's how I know we were set up. You can see that, can't you, Mr. White?
Don't tell me your name, I don't want to know! I sure as hell ain't gonna tell ya mine.
Uh-uh, just cops.
What do you think?
Not even a chance they punched through? You found a hole.
Where? Are they out in the car?
Two jobs back, it was a four man job, we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop.
For all I know, you're the rat.
Go down the hall, turn left, up those stairs, then turn right.
He ain't dead.
Before you got here, Mr. Orange was askin' me to take him to a hospital. Now I don't like turning him over to the cops, but if we don't, he's dead. He begged me to do it. I told him to hold off till Joe got here.
Enough! You better start talkin' to us, asshole, cause we got shit we need to talk about. We're already freaked out, we need you actin freaky like we need a fuckin' bag on our hip.
We don't think this place is safe.
Yeah, those guys too.
Maybe he did.
I've got eleven horses to get over the mountains before snow catches me and covers the feed.
No. We came down the hill a little fast and...  ...the wheel broke.  Can you fix it for us?
You can stay here if you like.
It's a nice place owned by an old couple named Wyatt.
Steve and me, we use a saddle for a pillow and roll up in a tarp.
Mostly, we open a can of beans and boil some coffee.
I'm not in his shoes, so leave me out of it.
Yeah.
He's learning his letters.
I couldn't leave you sitting by the road.
The who?
I'll make the soap myself.
Not on this trail, I don't. I've been over it before. Anyway, you ought to be pretty sleepy. Why don't you climb in back.
I don't expect anything. A minute ago I hadn't cuite waked up.
There won't be any rest of the trip. Over the hill is a stage road and when we hit it you get dumped into the first stage that comes along. So keep your money. You'll need it for the fare. I'm fed up with you. I was fed up with you before we started.
Hurry up.
Thanks for loading me on the stage. I know now why you did it.
It wouldn't happen to be this...
Which ranch?
I don't want to run short.
You sure worry that bone. He killed a fellow.
All right. I'll tell you.
Good thing you didn't.
Maybe I should. But I was never much on killin'. Anyway, he moved too quick and I just got him through the shoulder.  Looks pretty peaceful up ahead.
I'll eat when I'm good and ready.
I don't care what she asked you.
Like I told you, half those horses are mine. I'm makin' sure they get to the ranch safe. So let's quit arguing and do whatever you figure on doin'.
Sure. What other reason would there be?
Nobody asked you to.
What's there to be fair about?
I don't care.
I said I didn't care.
He won't take us.  Don't you want us around?
That's right -- you go back to sleep. Tomorrow when you feel better things will look a whole lot different. Don't you worry about anything -- Mary's going to talk things over with your folks --
Then why stay in the hills.
Plenty more.  And somewhere up there's the lode, the rock rotten with it.
Thank you, Mr. Graham.
He certainly could. About a month.
How many ways can a man say no.
Sounds fine. Only that isn't how it's going to be.
That's it then.
Stop it --
I can't read, Ma'am. I just look at the pictures.
Don't you even know your letters?
That'd be swell.  You know, you're an awful lot different than I thought you'd be.
No. We're not stayin' --
That's the end of the line.
Unicorn -- a kind of animal --
Hmmm... sort of like a horse -- with a horn in the center of its forehead.
Oh, I wasn't worrying.  I saw him saddling up and thought he was ready to leave.
You were supposed to be reading words.
But you're his brother.
Alex, what are you doing?
Okay... maybe that would be best.
Oh my god. Madam Elsa, my psychic, told me I would meet somebody whose name starts with a letter of the alphabet today.
Brenda, are you okay? Come sit.
Hey, I have an idea...
Yes, I feel their spirits. Cora... Keaton... I am here to communicate...
Yeah, it's great, isn't it. I think it's so cool... have a girl as a friend.
Alright!
Great!!!
Can you feel that?
No, Buddy, I'm the one he wants.
That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.
I don't care. You pick.
I think so.
Listen, no need for you to worry. All that stuff that happened before is behind us. Let's just try to move on.
Now you'll be mine, Cindy.
Just wait, you'll see.
Alright, let's take a vote...
My child, you're alive!
Now you gotta learn the correct slang.
Theo, did you see the animal?
What are you getting at, Professor?
There's something going on in this house. I'm not crazy.
Yeah, bitch, give me my apple. What's gotten into you?
Let me see the files.
I don't need your help. I'm perfectly capable.
Any of them hot?
Look, whatever you say, kid, but the more they're hurtin', the more they need a squirtin', if you know what I mean.  Ooh, I like her.
That one.
Let's not forget, folks, this is a study on sleep disorders.
What is it, Dwight?
You do.
And sexy.
That's it. I'm gonna put my food in your ass. I should warn you, I'm a black belt in karate.
I'm not even wearing any drawers. Forget about a belt.
I came as fast as I could, but at my age the little soldier needs a lot more thumpin before it starts pumpin. If I tickle my ass before...
How is she?
Not unless you have a paternity test to prove it.
Yeah, I always wanted to watch you eat.
Shorty, why don't you say grace?
Aww. Cool. Dude.
"Fucked me."
Alright, but I ain't drinking. and you're gonna have to look after me.
Mother? 
You don't think...
No more violence... No more violence...
Carl can't believe how much I make at swap meets.
Do you have the musical, "Annie"?
Why?
Oh Mom...
But, Chip...
You mean for TV or print?
Hey, I'm late for work. Bye, honey. 
Ooh, honey, I'm ready! Now! Now!
Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?
Well, Dottie, how come they're not here then, Fuck-Face?
I beg your pardon?
Alright, I'll try...  "Cocksucker". That's what she calls me.
COCKSUCKER! 
I certainly was not!
I... I'm not sure...  ...I... oohhh... Excuse me...
I do, please.
Always something isn't it?  Can I help you?
But...  I didn't wish... I didn't want him DEAD!
I saw one, but it was ridiculously overpriced!
Yes, but I lent it...
Bon Appetit!
Well, you're doing something wrong, Mrs. Sutphin. I'd recommend therapy for your son.  Thank you for taking the time to come to PTA.
Now, here's a babe!
I didn't hear anything. Got any dessert?
Mr. August, I'm not at all sure -
No.
You come to me with some wild story about her being in danger - naturally I want to know what kind of danger. I want to know where she is.
I know. For the first time I'm beginning to be frightened. I almost feel as if I'd never known my sister.
I'll try there.
But I like teaching school.
I guess most people are.
Nothing.
She was just asking about you - Whether it was nice to work for you or not.
Because I loved Jacqueline I thought I knew her. Today I found out such strange things ——frightening things. I saw a hangman's noose that she had hanging -— waiting —— I feel as if I'd never known her.
I'm not a youngster. I can understand.
But you have treated me that way.
Maybe the Romaris might have a room. They seem nice.
Look, Mary, now that I know you better, I think I can be more frank with you. I don't believe you. I still can't understand the reason for such a wild tale. It's like some of Jacqueline's stories.
A poet. He's sitting right over there. That's his table —— the one at the feet of Dante.
I don't think that's a good subject for jokes, Mr. Hoag.
Don't be ridiculous. For months I've had the best private detective in New York looking for Miss Gibson.
I don't know.
I suppose so. I can pick him up somewhere.
Not from me.
Yes.
You will have to make all the jokes, because I'm going to be very serious.
Yes. And now that I've shown you that I know that much, and can guess more -- will you trust me to look for Jacqueline?
But you're always at the library.
Devil worshippers!
I want to see what they read so I'll know what kind of books to give my friends as presents. There's nothing nicer for a gift than a book.
My dear fellow, it's neither your business to ask, nor mine to tell.
Actually I want to ask two favors of you -- one as a poet ——	one as a detective.
I wanted to get things clear for Jacqueline. Let her know --
You're even sentimental about it. What made you change your mind?
That's too bad.
This is Mrs. Redi, Mary.
That won't be necessary. I haven't much to say.
Why?
I don't believe it.
Oh yes, yes. One day a beautiful car comes here. This beautiful lady in furs gets out. There is a handsome man with her, and the chauffeur  The lady rents one of our upstairs rooms. The chauffeur changes the lock on the door. Then the lady never comes back --not to live, anyhow. She came back three, four times, but always alone and just to eat.
Yes -- and pays the rent every month.
Sometimes she can be quite careless. Why don't you try Mrs. Redi?
Yes?
I don't know no Gibson. This is a restaurant. Many people come here.
Why
What about Judd -- he knows about us.
Yes?
False alarm.
Yes.  Oh, you mean to bring in! No. Yes, I have some other things, no, I don't need to bring them in. This is all I need to stay here.
Yeah, I guess it is. My mother is a complete Anglophile, anything British makes her drool like a baby. She probably heard the name in some movie. She's a prisoner of public television now.
Thank you.
Sister older or younger?
No.
It's up to you. But I warn you, if you tell me something personal, I might do the same.
I think so. I remember reading somewhere that men learn to love what they're attracted to, whereas women become more and more attracted to the person they love.
Yeah, actually, I do. But John doesn't. At least not right now.
Well, let me put it this way: I cannot achieve an erection while in the presence of another person. So, for all practical purposes, I am impotent.
You're in therapy?
I believe in it for some people. I mean, for me it was silly, I was confused going in. So I just formed my own personal theory that you should never take advice from someone of the opposite sex that doesn't know you intimately.
Oh, see, I meant someone you've had sex with. That's part of the theory.
Who's Donna?
It won't. Are you ready?
Ann Bishop Millaney.
When we're making love?
Yes.
I fantasized about you.
I thought I made that clear before, when I said I would go down on you.
Yes.
No.
You said you weren't always impotent.
What was the problem?
And now you can?
Don't you get lonely?
I don't know. It all gets back to that Cynthia thing. I don't like her... eagerness. There's nothing left to imagine, there's no...
Subtlety, yes. No subtlety. Plus, I've never really felt able to open up with anyone. I mean, that other person I told you about, I enjoyed making love with him a lot, but I still wasn't able to really let go. I always feel like I'm being watched and I shouldn't embarrass myself.
Kind of. I mean, John's like this kind of... craftsman. Like he's a carpenter, and he makes really good tables. But that's all he can make, and I don't need anymore tables.
I... I can't answer that precisely.
But I don't understand --
No.
No, Ann, I can't. I can't forget it. It's not something I can fix. It's difficult. There s something in my mind... the way my brain works...  God, Ann, when you're with another person, and you're... inside them, you're so vulnerable, you're revealing so much... there's no protection. And... somebody could say, or do something to you while you're in this... state of... nakedness. And they could hurt you without even knowing it. In a way that you couldn't even see.  And you would withdraw. To make sure it didn't happen again.
I'm okay. It's okay.
You did that?
Stay away from the Garden District. Serious crime. I don't know what kind of place you're looking for, but there are a lot of studio-type apartments available elsewhere.
Are you having an affair?
Why don't I believe you?
Yeah. Jeez, give me some credit.
Yes.
Not very often.
No. I don't know. I haven't told him about the garbage thing because I'm pissed off at him right now. He's letting some old college buddy stay at our house for a couple of days, and he didn't even ask me about it. I mean, I would've said yes, I just wish he would've asked.
Did you masturbate?
So it was recently that you tried this.
Radon leakage?
Did you find him attractive?
Let me rephrase. Were you attracted to him?
But you don't have hidden motives for feeling that way, right?
You know what. You say it just to irritate me.
Well, he doesn't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing, anyway.
But he won't.
Let me talk to him first.
That goddam diamond stud earring that cost me a fucking fortune.
I don't know, I'll get her a card or something.
What do you mean he doesn't want me to come over? Did you tell him about me?
Why not?
Then what's the story, what's this "strange" bullshit all of a sudden? Is he drowning puppies, or what?
Then why'd you call me?
Why did you do that?
Did he touch you?
You are in trouble.
You know what I mean, you don't even know him!
Okay.
Bye.
Did you take your clothes off?
Wait a minute. Do you mean... don't tell me you... in front of him.
You want me to leave?
Well, like I said, Ann is my sister. Sisters talk. You can imagine the rest.
I, uh, know a guy at the power company.
I think you're right. So come on, I came all the way over here to find out what got Ann so spooked, tell me what happened.
I just want to ask you questions.
Absolutely not. They are for my private use only.
No.
Whichever you prefer.
Just a moment.
If you wish.  You're not wearing any underwear.
Is that what he tells you?
Now who the hell is going to do that for me?
So make an exception.
Cynthia. John. Meet me at my house in exactly one hour.
In here!!
You know what I mean.
She's there? What's she doing there?
I like the way he dresses.
"The wrong hands"? We're not talking about military secrets, John. They're just tapes that he makes so he can sit around and get off.
I just... Ann is very...
You realize you have no recourse legally? This stuff could show up anywhere.
You trust him.
I can't believe I let him stay in my house. Right under my nose. That deviant fucker was right under my nose and I didn't see him.
Maybe I don't want to leave. Maybe I want to talk.
It'll just be me.
Or go someplace in a hurry.
Where are the tapes, Graham?
I need help? Whose sitting by himself in a room choking his chauncey to a bunch of videotapes, Graham? Not me, buddy. You're the fucking nut. Now show me those tapes.
I'm not kidding, Graham, you'd better do what I say. Give me those tapes.
I'm not going to give you my keys.
Brian Kirkland, please.
He hates doctors. Doctors and lawyers. He never goes to doctors.
Hi. Want a drink?
Make love to me, 'Nine? I want you to make love to me. Please, please make love to me.
No, nothing.
Far as I know, yeah, that was her.
Yeah, that's Dr. St. Luc. He's the head of our little medical clinic here.
Mm? OK. Be with you in a sec.
Uh, OK. Sure.
A man... I think I recognized him... a man who lives here. He just...  ...he just attacked me for no reason at all. I just opened the door... I was making supper for you, and he grabbed me, he tried to kiss me...
I won't be at the office except to sign in.  I've got a lot of claims to check out. All over the place. Garages and more garages.  I'll come home right after work.
Oh, Nick, Nick... I can't take this.
Didn't she ever have these lumps looked at by a doctor?
Was this girl from Starliner Towers?
You touch my spleen, Rollo.  And here all the time I was thinking -- if I ever bothered to think about the good old days -- well, at least there's Rollo. He's in VD and he's happy.
It's crazy.
Who was she?
OK. I'll think about it.
Yeah.  Ah, I don't want to panic you or anything, but, I mean, the way Hobbes designed them, they're supposed to get out of hand real quick, so you don't have much time to think about what's happening to you. Once they decide to start pumping all those dynamite juices into the old blood stream... I dunno. But if you see some people doing kind of compulsive, maybe even bizarre sexual things...
OK, Rog. See you at ten.
NIGHT NIGHT
BREAKING OUT
Of course.
What's cookin', Bert?
It's no use pussyfooting around, Janet -- we have to cut quick and deep.
On the contrary.  He wants to see your ratings soar.  He needs a woman of exceptional desirability.
Can I just 'peep in' on Brad before I go home?
WELL FIRST YOU GO RIP RIP RIP THEN YOU GO SNIP SNIP SNIP THEN YOU WHIP IN A ZIP ZIP ZIP AN' YOU SPLIT IT UP TO THE HIP HIP HIP AN' AS YOU STRIP STRIP STRIP YOU QUIVER AND SHIVER FOR THAT SOFT CARESS AS YOU SLIP SLIP SLIP...INTO THAT LITTLE BLACK DRESS
LITTLE BLACK DRESS
Farley is already a TV winner as we shall see.  Dentonvile will run forever now that his interest has embraced mental hygiene.
Yes.  Macabre, isn't it.  The blind leading the blind.
Indulge?
He was a President.
Really.  What'll I pin this on?
SOME PEOPLE DO IT ON THE PAVEMENT
I don't want to get up there.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE FASHION
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR MOVEMENT
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR EMPLOYMENT
He was adopted you know.
Absolutely correct.
Who?
Oh.  Mom.  It's Brad.
Why?
YOUNG BLOOD
Absolutely true.  Compared to all of them, you are perfection, flawless beauty.
Fast!
And you can 'peep in' on Brad in the morning.
YOU'RE NO GOOD
WHAT A JOKE...
Ah, Macy.  Why don't you help Janet freshen up before rehearsal.
We're not confused.
Then put him with the Feldmans. Whatever you and your Mom decide is fine with me.
Honey, I'm just saying you know I need a little space before the wedding. Isn't that the point of this? Isn't that what we talked about with Dr. Gertler?
What are you pouring tonight?
Absolutement.  They have their own label that's just outstanding.
Say, is Maya working?
Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash.
You should get back together with Victoria. She was good for you.
Excellent. My friend and I are up here doing the wine tour, and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a Syrah.
Sure I know Maya. Real well.
Good. How're you?
Not so bad yourself.
Me too.
Couple of wrong turns.  Thanks to Magellan, here.
That's on us.
No, I'm an actor.
I am one of those guys.
No, we're paying for the wine.
Okay, there was a tasting last night. But I wanted to get us some stuff for the ride up. Check out the box.
You said you had it all lined up.
Come on, we're celebrating. I say we pop it.
Yes. Absolutely. Despite your crass behavior, I'm really glad we're finally getting this time together.
100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard. They don't even make it anymore.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
I thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother.
Thanks, Jack. So do I.  Here we are.
I owe her a call anyway.
Now we're talking.
Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this one is rather atypically made from 100% Pinot Noir.
When do we get to drink it?
So you're going to stop acting?
It's going to be great. Here's to us.
And she likes Pinot.
Didn't seem to me like that's what was going on. You were all over her.
Shut up.
Miles.
About a month ago. Six weeks.
I want to go home now.
I'm a quick learner.
If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
Bathroom.
Let's just say I'm uncomfortable with the whole scenario.
Well, I'm glad you got it out of your system. Congratulations. Mission accomplished.
I will.  See ya!
What? Of course I like Christine.
That was three years ago after that first party!
Can you give me some room here?
Thanks, Jack.
Nope.
Shut up.
Why are you so hostile? I know you're frustrated with your life right now, but you can choose not to be so hostile.  Here.
You have to tell me --
Put me down, Jack.
No.
Who's being selfish now? I'm the one getting married. I thought this week was supposed to be about me.
I don't have to.
I don't know. Tastes okay to me.  Hey, they got a reserve pinot.
Don't need a lecture. You fucking told Maya, didn't you?
You're joking, right?  What are you doing? Un-fucking- believeable. Can we just go back to the hotel and hang out and get up early and play nine holes before we head home?
No way. No way.
Forget it. Your wallet was stolen at a bar. Happens every day.
Yeah.
No, I'm okay.
So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
Oh, no, actually. Busy night.
You know it. This is my friend Jack. Jack, Maya.
Hey.
Yeah, I know.
I don't know. Special occasion. With the right person. It was supposed to be for my tenth wedding anniversary.
I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
Who me? Nah, I'd just fuck them up. That was the one unpolluted part of my divorce -- no kids.
Yeah. Definitely.
Good. So did I.
Um... did you still want to read my novel?
Well, nice to see you now.
What rehearsal dinner?
Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind?
Miles, I don't care if you come to the wedding or not.
Miles, maybe it is better if you don't come to the wedding.
So what's happening with your book?
I'm pregnant.
Both.
He had to make a phone call.
Yeah, I reserved the tee time about a month ago.
You golf?
Huh. Jack loves golf. Crazy about it.
Where?
And I could have already put clean sheets on the other bed and the fold- out. You are staying. Wendy, Ron and the twins are picking us up at 11:30 to go to brunch at the Sheraton. They do a magnificent job there. Wendy is so excited you're coming.
Well, you boys do what you want. I just think it would be nice for us to be together as a family on my birthday.
She doesn't answer me either.
It tastes funny.
I heard them Morgan.
I'm here.
What?  Colleen?... Colleen?
You don't mean it. It's just for show.
Just make noises then.
Are you going to do this or what?
Yes, it was.
I don't want any one of you spending time with Tracey Abernathy alone. Is that understood?
Yes.
Yes.
What time is it?
While they were trying to fix her up, all she kept asking about was you.
What are you doing?
Got it!
From what?
I'm close.
It came on about two hours ago. Woke me up.  We won Graham.
Listen, there's things I can take and a couple things I can't and one of them I can't take, is when my older brother --  -- who is everything I want to be, starts losing faith in things. I saw your eyes last night.  I don't want to ever see your eyes like that again, okay? I'm serious.
Me too.
Don't.
I just asked his name.
What's two?
Sounds made up.
There are none.
What kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without cracking it?
He definitely wasn't a midget.
I would say so.
He wasn't drinking. Ray fell asleep at the wheel.
Why not?
Yeah.
Don't worry.
There's nobody coming?
Where were you?
Someplace safe. How you feeling?
I'm sorry.
You'll never make it.
Have you thought at all about your plans?
Ten A.M.
Looks like that's not all they admired.
Where's Turley?
I expect.
Bad luck for me. Now I gotta bust him out of there.
Anybody got any ideas?
They run me off. They burned me out. They made it so I couldn't do. Just like Georgia. If you won't sell, they take it anyway.
Why?
We didn't get that far.
What now?
What's the matter, Paden? You afraid I couldn't get those two behind me?
That ain't right.
What are you doing here? I thought you were done with our family.
I don't have any family any more.
I just got to town.
You didn't tell me you owned a saloon.
Well, thanks, but forget it.
We didn't talk about this.  They took the little boy, Cobb.
I saw how you're putting Mal Johnson straight.
I run the place. What can I get you?
You see that fellow over there in the gray coat?
He left me.
Nah!  What's he got? This is a nice saloon, but there are other nice saloons. It's not the money. Not for you. Why can't I get ahold of it?  Cobb says there's no telling what you're going to care about.
I like your attitude. But it can be risky.
I wouldn't worry about that.
Who?
Hmm... Mike and Ike's.
-- Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
Spare me.
You can have everything -- office, car, assistants -- all I want is the picture.
Out of the question.  A circus like that?
No problem.  Do you want to come in?
If it's on the page...
She'll do her own.  Theater training.
I'll send you her resume.
Which accounts for your percentage.  When do I get to meet this dream?
I'll walk you out.
Simone does not control my destiny.
Better late than never.
Soon.  Soon.
No, of course not!  Why?  Would you care if we were?
Lainey and I just wanted to congratulate...
Is it Wednesday?  It's Wednesday. How embarrassing.  I don't know what I was thinking.  With all the excitement lately...  Am I interrupting something?  Are you expecting company?
Impossible.
I want you back too, Viktor.
How much wine have you had?
It was a great show, Dad...
He also happens to be the most talented man I've ever known.
Why?
Please put your clothes on
I just think actors talk too much. Does the world really want to hear your life story just because you've got a movie opening Friday?
Let's talk about the work that you care so much about.
How about the nudity?
You never were together, Hal.
Really?  She didn't mention it.
But she's right there!  I must feel her!
How did the wall get there?
I'm fine, Hal.  How are you?
Come on, Hank.  A synthespian, virtual actor -- ?
-- a living, breathing actor -- I can't work with a fake.
That's the point, Hank.  No matter how good they are, they're still Mickey Mouse.  Everyone's tried. Everyone's failed.  It can't be done.
You do?
I can't believe you people!  No wonder she never comes to these things!
-- You finished the film on your own terms, that's what matters. Did you really do all the post yourself?
Night, Lainey.
I noticed.
Why not?  I can get you something else.  What do you want?
No, that was me.
Er,... good.
Maybe he's talking to himself.
Long live the First Amendment.
Is that why she left you?
I had three other offers.  I only signed on to this picture out of... loyalty.
But that's Simone's part.
You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me?
Good.
Buy it?  They're paying for it. And around here that's how you really know they buy it.
You are birth of... what?  A Phenomenon.  A miracle.  A new era in show business.  All I wanted to do was finish the film.
What? You don't see enough of me at the store?
Do you think I should stop by on my way back? Show you what I got? It's not a problem.
They're my dad's. The lenses hurt my eyes.
...De profundis clamo ad te domine.
Congratulations.
Not even little ones that aren't supposed to hurt?
That's good.
You saw that on T.V., Cole?
See, this is why I lose at poker. Yes, I do have a question.
Look over there.
You hate him?
What if she has to pee when she's working? You think she just holds it?
What?
Yes.
Your eyes told me.
Me too.
I don't know, Cole.
Don't fail me.
Yes, it did.
Do you know what 'Yo no quiero morir' is?
Where will you go, where no one has died?
Really?
Oh my God.
Standing next to my window.
...I don't know.
Cole, please stop.
Like what?
Who!
J. C. Penny's?
How'd he know I'd come?
Chicken blood on the crops.
Nope.
Slut.
Yeah. To get the hell off this farm.
Not lately.
The hell with this.  I'm coming back up!!!
You need someone who can protect you, Suzie.
Hell, no. But you missed a damn good sermon. "You can't hide a wicked heart from the eyes of the Lord."
Bus broke down.
All right. "Fratricide". Minor technical detail.
Cowshit? Are you sure the Aztecs even had cows?
Sprinkled a pinch of manure in there just before I rolled it.
Harvest moonshining!
Joseph Macdonald. Damn right, boy. And don't you forget it.
Broke her heart you never visited... But I always said you'd come back.
Pardon?
I'll be fine here.
"Blood?"
People say he was a murderer.
Amends...?
Who? Us?!
Yeah. Our own. I don't see why we got to go along for the ride.
Buzzzzzzzzzz. Sorry, wrong answer!
Yeah. Sure. I'm screwing up the song. You're the one who's been two beats behind since we kicked it off.
Which means we've got ONE week to start acting like a professional band.
Tell me you checked the bus before we left, Carl.
Nah. Just you.
I said that's enough!
I... heard something... came in here last night. Must have gone to sleep.
Mmmm -- so can I...
Billy Bob's dead. -- We were wrong -- he didn't do anything. I-It's the scarecrow --
It's you. You and your father.
You brought us here. And that morning I found you in the barn. You had scratches on your face --
No. Not without you --
Can't help it, Suze... family sticks together...
I was getting 'warmed' up.
Us? We been... moonlighting.
Bill, we need to talk!
Hell, Jack, your leisure activities ain't my business.
Sherry, you gonna create a hysteria?
That's not funny.
Whatcha' doin'?
I'll get Wally to show me sometime then.
Bill, I'll run out to your car, call for paramedics from there.
I know what people say, Bill. I... Remember, back in high school I worked at my father's gas station?
When you wanted to run away, I called your dad.
I'm sorry.
We can't make it. Just get away, when you get the chance.
Yeah. Good.
Okay.
A Martian is from Mars, Trevor.
Shelby!
The problem, Starla, is, the last person anyone saw her talking to was Grant.
What the fuck they gonna do with her in a hospital, Bill?
Shelby --
Shelby! We need people out here at Cosgrove and McCammon right away!
Shit. You're kidding me. Nope. BRENDA Brenda! GRANT Hell, you were --
Shut up.
How many you need?
I'm sorry. I don't just have some switch.
That's disrespectful.
My present?
Okay.
Heh. It ain't as bad as it looks, sugarplum. Dr. Carl was just here. I had a reaction to a bee sting. He gave me a prescription. Said I should be fine, in a couple days.
No! No. Heh. I'll be right back.
Margaret.
Not that I don't have any respect for the law, but what's your problem, man?
What's the matter? Legend has it Bandit LaRue's king of the road.
What do you think?
Absolutely not. In fact, I picked up a bride yesterday; except she was a singer.
Cute. No, 'cause no one's ever made it from Atlanta to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours.
I never looked at it that way.  You ask a lot of questions.
Having fun.
Driving?
You know, you're not a bad passenger.
I don't know. Maybe Jerry Jeff sent the heat after us.
Ciao.
He's after us again!
I've never seen him before in my life. I'm just trying to help you out.
You want to lose this putz or not?!?
How do you know?
You take the front, I'll take the back.
Yeah?
And?
Absolutely.
Yes.
No one's ever done it before. This'll put us on the map.
Yeah, I can tell he's gonna be a major asset.
If you ask me, I think we should make that run to Choo Choo Town and pick up that load of lumber. Nice. Easy. And within the law.
Go.
Twenty-one is nineteen.
Shouldn't we pay 'em for the damages?
What's your twenty?
If I knew, Cledus; I'd be on College Bowl.
On its way. Give me a coupla minutes, okay?
If you don't, we can kiss that Kenworth good-bye.
I'm at marker eight-five.
Just don't worry about it.  How we doin' timewise?
I'll keep streaking. Pick me up.
Ticking away, but it looks like a clear shot to Hot Town. Green lights and white lines all the way.
But they're waiting for me. They don't even know Cledus Snow exists.
Go head on, breaker.
Pick it up, Breaker.
Bandit, this is Mister B, and I'm gearjamming this rolling refinery. You got another Smokey on the rubber?
See, running Coors Beer east of Texas is what bothers me. It makes me a bootlegger.
About one to five years worth.
Some boy named Bandit's been givin' the Highway Patrol shit fits.
Believe me, that won't be a problem.
Who's Fred?
That's a Texas bubble gum machine on your back porch.
Yes, ma'am.
Then it must be a helluva idea.
-- Yeah, I heard. But they won't hold him for long. Anyway, he sure gave them sumbitches a run for their money.
And everybody, all the time. Yeah, it's a chore.
What kind of personnel?
Of course. Yes.
Yeah. Have you been able to get through to the Nomad's security?
Mortal.
-- Agent Carruthers. Do you know where is he now?
-- he was wearing one of our jackets.
Ww... uh...
You shot me and murdered my friends.
Thass' right.  I got other brother's though, so it ain't so bad.
Yeah, why.
That's not possible. I told you.
Won't work, we're just gonna have to chance it man. I'm sorry.
I sent Hugo, he should be there!
The Teamsters had a reform measure going to ballot that didn't sit too well with the local syndicate. Night of the polling, big black-tie to-do downtown and the Tremor Brothers crash the party. Literally.
Jack, if the rumors hold and Israel is really the great white whale of snitches, then the mob is looking to put all kinds of bullets into his ass and pour some serious psychotics into the mix to do just that. So what real incentive is there to track him on something as small-time as a skip trace, when it's putting you and yours in the path of severe pain and suffering and an almost certain prelude to doom.
Shit, if you're on a crazy jag, why stop there, why not take Fort Knox with a fucking slingshot or go into Hell after Hitler... I like your chances a lot more.
I left him a message.
...to what? Incinerate? 'Cuz I'm almost dead certain there's not a fucking laundry detergent or dry cleaning process known to man that can ever return that jacket to its former glory! Some shit, suffice it to say, just don't wash out.  Now, the money question... To whom does that stain belong?
That's Mecklen. The deal's closing. I can pick that phone up and I can work this out.  You'll walk with me.
Sparazza was the one who introduced Israel to the life, gave him his first big break, brought him through the ranks.
You think it's possible he could be involved in the Israel hit?
We have to transport Mr. Israel to Las Vegas, time is of the essence. The gulfstream is standing by on the jetway at Tahoe International. I'm sorry, I'm restricted from disclosing anymore information. Return to Washington. You'll be debriefed in the coming days.
-- You can and you will.
I don't see it like that at all.
I'm here.
-- he's doing it then, huh --
Fuckin' A, first survive, yes?
Yeah, I can front this.
A million flat.
Okay, well, y'know, then we just gotta get Israel.
-- good, then all you got to be is grateful.
You love her?
Well, if it's any comfort, I's goin' in to there to act a fool baby.  Straight rockin' heat and slayin' niggas --
I probably woulda busted on you too... and what a shame that woulda been.
'Cuz we don't need to draw any more shit down on our heads. We hit whoever's between us and Israel. I don't want to dead the whole floor and I don't want to be killing women no matter how they make a living.
...Girl, y'know I had to bring big mamma through.
The try t'wild out on my boo and it's on and crackin'! I'm layin' niggas out.
I ain't tryin' to break a sweat for that sorry ass nigga.
C'mon, I say we bounce now, kick it for a lil' bit, play some craps.  ...Maybe spend the night?
What?
...What are they doin' right now...?
Naw baby, they heard about that Triad hit, the work ya'll put in and they recognize the skills. And this ain't no tryout, tap-dance "show us your shit" thing neither -- if ya'll want this then I'mma go git it for 'ya.
Can it work?
Who, here, could possibly care what you want?  At best, you're Employee of the Month for the highest bidder in the Solaris auction.  They have no idea what's going on up here. They've never even been in space. And I'm supposed to listen to you?
In the lab.  With her, probably.
No, she won't.
What?
Where's Sartorius?
That depends.
What is it?
No.
She drank liquid oxygen.
Her oxygen would have run out.
Into what?
But I can't leave with you.  I won't make it.
Yes.
Book?
What do you mean?
Not exactly.  It exists in a continuum that wasn't proven until ten years ago, a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the Universe. An infinite number of them, in fact. It was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the Universe, Space, or Space-Time.  It was completely counter-intuitive.  We had to unlearn everything.
It's something.
I been thinking about how much I hate you.
I did too.
Snow thinks we shouldn't leave until we figure out a way to document it, to prove its existence to the planet Earth.  This is hilarious: He thinks it's God, but he wants it to sit still for a photograph so he can show the folks back home.
It's a violent response to something we haven't figured out.  Don't let the cowardly demeanor fool you: He is ruthless.  Unblinking in his prejudice.
You don't love me.
I'm just trying to understand what's going on.
No.  I love you.
Rheya.
Neither can I.  Not any of it. There's no reference point for what's going on; it's never happened before. It's a clean break in the fabric of the Universe; a gap.  There is nothing to do but experience it, moment-to- moment, and not let it destroy us.
Not this time.
I love you.
I'm disgusting.
Neither did I.
I can't stay here.
Then you won't make it.
I want you here.
Yes, you are --
I have consciousness, but I am not mortal.  Don't you see why I'm going crazy?
Am I really her?
You must have been dreaming.
Are the actions of Solaris premeditated?
You still writing the occasional magazine article?
Hard to find doors in this place.
I have to pick something up before Bergdorf's closes, then stop at a reception just a few blocks away.
No, Ma'am.
I came on at 8:00.
Yeah.
Listen, that was my fault.
Big talk... Desperate guy.
So it was "love".
And "is"...?
I saw you with a dog, in my mind.
Let go!
Oh, I'm fine.  They've replaced you with quite an entourage.  It's a regular "marching band".  You should see me on the street, you'd think I was the First Lady --
Tomorrow night.  Can you come?
Do you dance?
... Don't explain.
It's Venza.  He wants you.  You, for Ellie and Tommy.
Listen, I'll... see you again.
I don't know Tommy.
Absolutely.
Your what...?
Well, actually, she looks better than that.
Unbelievably handsome.  You look fantastic in a suit.
I don't know that Ellie.  He might get out.  Garber's not bein' straight with the witness, she could be in deep shit if she identifies him, and it's my job to convince her she won't be.
Why?
I might stop you.
Ellie, it was a formal party...
Did you hear what I said?!!
D'you have to say "fucking" every other word?
You heard me.
You talked to his wife?
Get away from me... get away!  She means that much to you, you stay with her.  But you come back, you come back for me.  Not for Tommy, not for your mother, or your fucking job, but for me.
I'm all right.
I just sat and listened.
That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs...
I brought the girl.  She's outside.
Koontz!  Let her come in!  Claire! It's pitch dark in here!  You're gonna have trouble seeing anything, so just come in, and straight down a long hall.  Then stand at the door so we can see you. We want to see your face and we won't be able to until you get to the kitchen door!
Don't you fuckin' give orders to me...
What the fuck you doin'?!
Okay, I guess.
We're gonna pass the street.
No. No, that's okay.
You stop him?
Remember Little League?
I know.
No, no, listen. They're tryin' to say he was in cahoots with this killer--
-- but they got it all wrong.  Any fool can figure it out.  Spider-Man nailed this guy!
I saw him too.  He was silly and obnoxious.
They'll never take me alive.
A little bunny I saved from dissection.
Well, I've missed a lot of classes myself...
Lemme down, bugface!
Parker-- you go here, right?  Got your camera?
Well, thanks.  You wouldn't believe what I went through to get those. Right after you took my camera, this ambulan--
Double-exposures? But they're not-- I was in--
You print pictures of Bigfoot!
Police, help!  Po-- mmph.
Uh-huh. Look, this should be skintight.  Bright colors.  Red, maybe a deep midnight blue.
Deal.  But don't tell anyone.  I want to keep a low profile.
Sorry. I'm still getting the hang of this.
Just call me Spidey.
Thank God.
You want to give them something, but they'll just buy more Ripple. And they smell so... bad.
I'd never admit that.
Sort of.  I'm returning the-- that outfit that you hated so much. Maybe I can get my money back.
Do you mind if I come too?
So you've found Thorkel?
And he'll need a cyclotron.  He can't use ours-- he's already destroyed it.  Guard every nuclear accelerator on the Eastern Seaboard.  New Haven, Long Island, two in Cambridge--
Any sign of our friend?
Precise equipment… such as waldos…
That's the understatement of the year.
Tofu.  Ben, I wish you wouldn't.
Let's talk in the hall.
I couldn't care less.  What I've done is--
I'll repeat the experiment.  I will hold the truth. That's the only thing that matters.
Hi, Professor.  What's up?
Not a lot.  I saw inside of the Science Center.  What exactly happened?
I don't think I'll be running into him.
Oh-- I don't know-- thanks, Mr. Reiss, but--
Good. We'll make it oral for now. Meet me at Rockefeller Center at six tonight.
Letterman show, NBC. We'll talk then.  Bye.
Yup.  Oh, here's your check, minus my commission.  Solid, solid novelty act.
I just gave-- yeah, sure.
I'm not so happy myself.
Sure, in the war.  Pull those cables--
No, no!  Not there!
I wouldn't talk about things like that.
Is you all little Adolfs?
Just pulled the old match gag, see!
Forget it. He'll be back here. They've got no proof.
Roger.
Easy! Walked right through the gate, past the guard. Like he was some Kraut Field Marshal.
Everybody but Joey, and you know who.
Such nice boys! It makes me sick to --
Which one of you is what?
It's on me.
That is correct.  Lieutenant Dunbar, I came to apologize for the accommodations. Ordinarily, of course, we never put officers up with enlisted men.
Quite a transportation jam we are having outside of Frankfurt! They are very angry in Berlin. They will be even angrier on the East Front, waiting for that ammunition train. Don't you think so, Lieutenant?
Of course you don't. Now, Lieutenant, how would you like to join me in my quarters? I have a nice fire going.
Abfuehren!
I didn't do it -- I didn't do it.
They also smell of moth balls.  When were they issued? This morning?
He is a prisoner of war until you can prove sabotage.
All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
Simply this. After the hostilities are ended, there will be such a thing as a War Crimes Commission. If this man should be convicted without proper proof, you will be held responsible, Colonel von Scherbach.
Sprechen Sie deutsch?
Droppen Sie dead!  Raus mit dem Ofen. Los! Los!
Comrade! Comrade! Otchi Tchorniya -- Otchi Tchorniya!
I don't care if they wear galoshes!
Let me go!
Yeah? How you going to fix me up with Betty Grable?
What's the award?
He don't have to worry. He'll trade the Krauts for a six-burner gas range. Maybe a deep freeze too.
This is a good one!  Shut up, everybody! Listen to this!  'The President of the United States to Harry Shapiro. Greeting: Having submitted yourself to a local board, you are hereby notified to report...' What do you know! So now I'm a draft evader!
There's a time in every man's life when he wants to be alone! So go away!
Yes, sir.
Curtains would do wonders for this barrack.  You will not get them.
Answer the question. How do you rate all those privileges?
You'd better cut out in back of the south latrine.
Lay off, Schulz. He's got a sickness. He's krank.
Go on, Sefton -- butt out!
You take it out. Only you're going to have a riot on your hands.
It adds up that you got yourselves the wrong guy. Because I'm telling you. The Krauts wouldn't plant two stoolies in one barrack. And whatever you do to me you're going to have to do all over again when you find the right guy.
Sure I heard it. I still got one good ear.
You starting that again?
That's right. Or would you rather see Dunbar lying out there in the mud tomorrow morning like Manfredi and Johnson?
Uh-huh. Fell right on my head.  Sprechen sie deutsch?
Don't you know? Because I got my own ideas.  Let's have that civilian stuff.
Shoot!
Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two, sharp.
You can tell Father Murray to --
Are you questioning me?
Where. Up Joey's ocarina. Didn't you know?
The Germans know where Dunbar is.
Go where? To the Kommandant's office and tell him where Dunbar is?
What time?
All right, gentlemen, I will find it myself. Now let's see.
Ganz einfach... Streichhoelzer... und eine Zigarette...
How would you like to give Frau Schulz a pair of silk stockings for Christmas?
Not particularly.
Russian women prisoners?
Look at them, Lieutenant. Everybody is a clown! How do you expect to win the war with an army of clowns?
HoS qorDu. 
Twelve years, sir.
I wanted to save Geordi. I tried. But I experienced something I did not expect.  I believe it was fear.
But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend.  Does that make me a coward?
That is true. However, I believe my growth as an artificial lifeform has reached an impasse. For thirty-four years I have endeavored to become more "human"- to grow beyond my original programming. And yet I am still unable to grasp such a simple concept as humor. This emotion chip is the only answer.
Agreed.
It appears to be a magnetically sealed.
The station complement was nineteen.
I am quite...preoccupied with concern about Geordi.
I'll go. You have the Bridge.
But why destroy a star?  Thank you, Guinan.
For you. This is where you wanted to be.
Wherever he wanted to be.
What makes you think things will be any different this time?
It's our pleasure.
No, no. Thank you.
I'm from what you would consider the future; the 24th-century.
That's right.
Did we do it? Did we make a difference?
I thought you might.
A photon torpedo?
I always do.
Captain, I don't know how much longer I can hold her together!
What do you want?
No. Thank you.
A quantum implosion has occurred within the Amargosa star. All nuclearfusion is breaking down.
Too big. How long until the ribbon arrives?
Very well. I suppose I could make out my weekly report to Starfleet Command without your input.  "Admiral Lusby, regarding the unusual behavior of Jean-Luc Picard: I find him increasingly irritable, remote and uncooperative. I recommend forced shore leave at a Starbase facility in order to-"
In a way, he was as close as I ever came to having a child of my own.
You see the top yardarm, now look to the-
Trilithium?
Right. And they'll be vulnerable for at least two seconds.  Data,lock onto that plasma coil.
All automates ready and functioning. Automatic moorings retracted. All speeds available through transwarp drive.
I can't get an answer. Starfleet is up to its brass in galactic conference. No one has time for those who only stand... and wait.
Message acknowledged. All units will be informed.
Mr. Scott, we need everything you've got now.
Aye, sir.
Could be Grissom.  Patch in the hailing frequency.  U.S.S. Grissom, this is Enterprise calling. Come in, please.
Wait a minute...! We don't know what we're talking about here...
Sector three... Sub-tropical vegetation... Temperature --  Temperature decreasing rapidly --
... Fascinating.
Underground deposit?
There's only one thing it could be... Short range scan.
Cross referenced and verified. An unidentifiable life form reading.
Grissom, your message acknowledged. Will advise... Out.
If I hadn't, it might have been years -- or never!
Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.
"... If the Captain decides that the mission is vital and reasonably free of danger." I know the book, Saavik.
I'll try to remember that, Captain.
I know, but -- let's do it by the book. Stand by on this channel.  Go.
Mr. Scott. Have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four?
Your reputation is secure, Scotty.  Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'll be in my quarters.
Thank you, Mr. Scott. I'll try not to take that personally.  My friends... I can't ask you to go any further. Dr. McCoy and I have to do this. The rest of you do not.
He gave his life to save us. That is all I know.
Only one thing, Sir... Get him off this planet... His aging is part of what's going on around us...
Goodbye, David.
Mr. Scott: as good as your word.
It's been a while, sir. Here we go... Retrothrusters!
That's the good news. He's home in bed, full of tranquilizers, and he promised me he'd <U>stay</U> there... They say it's exhaustion...  We'll see.
Welcome home, Jim.
Genesis?! Whatever for?
As surely as if it were my own!  Harry, give me back the Enterprise! With Scotty's help...
Then let me speak to the Council! Harry, <U>please</U>! I can <U>make</U> them understand!!
Of course... Now take my suggestion, enjoy your leave -- and let all this tension blow away.
Torpedoes coming in -- !
No tricks, Kirk. You have one minute.
But, why?
Because he asked you to! He entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body. He asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you: his Katra. His living spirit.
Yes... But -- how...?
Perhaps they wish to take you prisoner.
They outnumber us, my Lord --
Steady. Continue on impulse power.

Wait!... Wait...
Put him on screen!  Study him well.
Good for you, Lieutenant.
It would destroy such life in favor of its new matrix --
I don't dispute that in the wrong hands --
But, as you are so fond of observing, Doctor, I'm not human.
Thank you.
And who am I hiding from?
Ah.
I'm sorry you feel that way, Doctor. Admiral Kirk's orders are confirmed. Please prepare to deliver Genesis to us upon our arrival. Reliant out.
Taking Genesis? Who? Who is taking Genesis?
Stage One of our experiments was conducted in the labora- tory. Stage Two of the series will be attempted in a lifeless underground; Stage Three will involve the process on a plane- tary scale. What follows is a computer projected simulation of Stage Three. Please watch closely.
I don't think there's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks. Next time, we'll design a bigger one.
This is just to give us something to do, isn't it?  Come on.
You know what she'll say...
Captain, this is the garden spot of Ceti Alpha VI --
And I'll wager he never told you about his shipmate, the beautiful and courageous Lieutenant McGiver, who gave up everything to join me in exile. OUT OF LOVE. And see how <u>Admiral Kirk</u> requited her devotion -- She's dead as earth!
There is some pain at first, I am told, and then the effects are quite benign -- until the end. That was what I learned from watching my wife.
<u>We were still there</u>, you dumb bastard! We could hear the screams all the way to the transporter room --
Is that what you came here to say?
The Admiral's son.
Locking phasers on target.
Raise them --
We can't fire, sir; they've damaged the photon controls and the warp drive. We must withdraw!
Sir, we must!  We must repair the damage. Enterprise will wait; she's not going anywhere.
Inoperative.
I shall avenge you --
Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is on the phaser control --
Just the batteries, sir. I can have auxiliary power in a few minutes --
I'm trying, sir. Stand by...
Sensors, Captain?
Give the word, Admiral.
All right, we'll do the job with auxiliary power.
Admiral, this is Spock.
Right on schedule, Admiral. Just give us your coordinates and we'll beam you aboard.
Yes, SIR.
Oh do you? Have you any idea, Midshipman Preston, how many times I've had to listen to Mr. Scott on the Comm, telling me his troubles? Have you any idea the ribbing I've had to endure in the officers' mess to the effect that the Enterprise is a flying death trap?
Yours was not a solution which would have occurred to a Vulcan mentality.
She's half Romulan, Jim. The admixture makes her more volatile than -- me, for example.
The Enterprise. I must check in before your inspection. And you?
Raise shields! Energize phasers, stand by to --
At least we know he hasn't got it. Just keep nodding as though I'm giving orders. Saavik, punch up the data charts of Reliant's command console -- hurry...
Reliant could be hiding behind that rock.
Best speed, Scotty...
Steady as you go...
Or the one.
Sir -- we won't leave you behind...!
I don't believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities.
... No, sir. It has not.
As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me.
Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems.
There is no correct resolution. It is a test of character.
Phasers on stun. Move out.
If Stage Two was completed, it was underground -- she said it was going to be underground.
Come, come, Lieutenant, you of all people go by the book. Hello, Spock. You remember Dr. Marcus...
'... no uncoded messages on an open channel...'
Good, I believe you already know my, uh, son --
Stop engines.
<u>I did nothing</u> -- except get caught with my britches down. I must be senile. Mr. Saavik, you just keep right on quoting regulations. Meantime, let's find out what the hell is going on and see how bad we've been --
Try again.
Best guess, Mr. Sulu. Fire when ready.
Course heading, Captain?
You are half human. The Computer knows that.
You do this -- for friendship?
Bob... it's tearing me apart.
A moment alone, please.
It'll come back to him.
Spock, start your computations for time warp.  Come on, Bones. Let's pay Scotty a visit.
Let's hope so, Bones. Mr. Sulu, set us down in Golden Gate Park.
What do you think, Spock?
Come on, Pavel...
Uhura is busy. I am monitoring.
Pardon me, Doctor, I am hearing many calls of distress.
Really? You think this is its way of saying "Hi there" to the people of the Earth?
No, Spock. It means he feels safer about your "guesses" than most other peoples facts.
How do you explain slowing pulse, low respiratory rate and coma?
Captain, their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power!
Negative. It's impacting on all our systems!
Yes, under "U.S. Government." Now we need directions.
I have the coordinates of the reactor...
I was not.
How soon?
I assure you that won't be necessary. We were only trying to help...
I buy that. What about him?
LDS?? Are you dyslexic on top of everything else? Come on, Lemme give you a lift. I have a notorious weakness for hard luck cases -- that's why I work with whales.
Uh huh. What about you? Where you from?
A landlubber. Come on, what the hell were you boys really trying to do back there? Was it some kinda macho thing? If that's all, I'm gonna be real disappointed. I hate that macho type.
It's his way.
Just lucky, I guess.
They'll be flown in a special 747 to Alaska and released there.
See, yes. But we'll tag them with radio transmitters on a special frequency so we can keep tabs on them.
What's what?
You want the details?
Then tell me when the whales are leaving.
Right.
Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?
What do I care? I've got nobody but those whales...
All right. The frequency is 401 megahertz.
... You have a point...
You're going to your ship, I'm going to mine. Science Vessel. I've got 300 years of catch-up learning to do.
Don't worry. I'll find <u>you</u>.  See you around the galaxy...
Jim, Spock, Jim. Remember...?
That would be futile, Admiral. The probe would neutralize us easily.
What is our target in time?
Judging by the pollution content of the atmosphere, I believe we have arrived at the late 20th Century.
But you said toxic.
Simple logic will suffice. We need a map.  That one should do.
How do you know this...?
Ah... The giants.
Admiral, if we were to assume these. whales are ours to do with as we please, we would be as guilty as those who caused their extinction.
Yes?
The tank will be finished by morning...
Thank you, Spock.
Is that the logical thing to do, Spock...?
Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power.
Aye, sir!
On speakers.
Humpbacked - people.?
How long, Scotty?
Admiral, you'll be trapped!
Thank you, Lt. Saavik.
Don't concern yourself, Saavik. Your leave has been granted for good and proper cause.  How are you feeling?
You will be in good hands here.
Vulcans are well known as the intellectual puppets of the Federation!
We deny nothing! We have the right to preserve our race!
I demand to see the owners! I demand --
I will. Can my assistant come, too?
... Yes?
Hi. Huey 205, isn't it?
Old, yes. But interesting.  Do you mind if I ask a few questions...?
It is not an effort. You are my son.  Besides; I am most impressed with your performance in this -- crises.
Tell her I feel fine...
Capability, yes. But where can warp drive take us, except away from here...?
You'll stop reviewing what happened yesterday... stop planning for tomorrow... until you find...  Let me ask you a question -- have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time?
Yes. Exactly. Nothing more complicated than perception.  You explore the universe. We've discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself... full of powerful forces... most people aren't aware enough of the now... to ever notice them...
By now the Son'a have scanned the area and know that just as well as we do.
The "mighty" Federation could learn a few things from this village...
Really?
Sometimes I do.
I play the violin... and my chess routines are quite advanced...
For what purpose?
No.
The artificial lifeform was right?
How about a passive radiation scan?
What you're seeing is a computer driven image created by photons and forcefields...
I don't know.
In six hours, every living thing in this system will be dead or dying.
It is not over.
Someone probably said the same thing about the Romulans a century ago.
Delay the procedure. Let my people look at the technology.
Then the Son'a can establish a separate colony on this planet until we do...
Do you know how to disable the injector?
Scan for lifesigns.
No, sir. But it wasn't easy... being among them...
Sir, as the Enterprise left orbit, one of their support craft went down to the surface.  It appeared to be the Captain's Yacht. Five persons on board.
We'd have to tag every one of them... that would take time... and we don't have it. The Enterprise is only nineteen hours from communications range with the Federation...
May I talk to you alone?
The shields in that section won't protect them against the thermolytic reaction...
So, you're saying he still knew the difference between right and wrong.
I'll be in Engineering.
You got me, Commander.
... so they need us to put out one more brush fire.  Anyone remember when we used to be explorers?
We won't be able to go any faster than one-third impulse in that muck...
Yes... yes, I... can hear you...
It's good to have you back, Worf.  Slow to one-third. Take us in.
Transmit a wide band co-variant signal. That'll get his attention.
The metaphasic radiation in those rings is in a state of extreme flux. Steer clear of them, Mister Worf...
Picard to Crusher...
Accelerated hair growth is often experienced by Klingons during Jak'tahla...
Decloak the holo-ship and engage a tractor beam, Mister Worf.
Say the greeting again...
They have an incredible clarity of perception, Captain. I've never encountered a species with such mental discipline...
But it's comfortable.
Or you could try lying down.
And have you noticed how your boobs have started to firm up?
I look forward to reading your report.
I've stabilized him for now... but he's in a coma and he's going to need radiometric therapy. I want to take him to the ship.
Jean-Luc, this man needs medical attention, now.
Um... yeah.  Now he's going to need a respirator. Do you have one?
I'm a little worried about some of these bone fragments. If they move any closer to the brain, we could be looking at a hemorrhage.
Intelligence... ambition... desire... I bring order to chaos...
And I need to control this ship. Let me into your mind.
Bring us about. Target Borg ship alpha four, port side battery.
Ready quantum torpedo.
What?
Today is March second, 2063. The time in Montana is oh-eight-forty- five.
I am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before. As an android, I am in complete control of my neural net. The information contained there cannot be forcibly removed.
I am the Borg.
I will admit... there are times when I wish I had an emotion chip I could turn on and off.
Let's go.
There should be some kind of manual release...
It could be the radiation, Captain. Try from the surface.
Can you reconstruct the throttle valve?
We need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours...  There must be some design schematics... blueprints...
Then we'll just have to assume it's still there...
<U>Engage.</U>
It'll be tight, but we should make it.
Lieutenant, actually. Lieutenant Jonathan Scrimm. I'm the head of the Resurrection Protective Force.  And you are?
Great name. French?
It wasn't a trick. I used to be an electrical engineer.
These people you're calling "Vulcans"... who are they? Where do they come from? How many troops? What kind of weapons?
Wrong answer, Mister Picard. Try again.
Yes, he is.
Trade. Okay. The photographs... for a straight answer.  Who are you? And how do you know Zephram?
I'm sure it is. But it'll have to wait until tomorrow.
Myself... and a few other friends of Zephram's.
I have to...
That's impossible.
This may be hard for you to understand... but I'm duty-bound not to interfere with you, or anyone else here... any more than is absolutely necessary.
Aye, sir.
Fire.
Intercept course, full impulse.  Weapons status?
We're still in Earth orbit.
Life signs?
Normally, I would agree. But in this case, the mission requires a certain knowledge of 21st century history. You're many things, Number One, but you're not much of an historian.
They appear to be modifying the deflector dish.
Computer -- thermal enhancement.
They're converting the deflector dish into an antennae...
Nothing.
The Borg.  Some of them must've beamed over before we destroyed their ship.  Seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields.
Something is very wrong, Commander. We're falling back.
Captain, I've scanned the planet. The atmosphere contains a high concentration of methane, carbon monoxide and fluorine. The oceans have been chemically altered, as well.
Target...
There were no planetary defense systems in this era. Their weapons were designed to fight each other... not extraterrestrials.
Admiral Donald...Bill...
The longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be, Mr. President.
We DO sleep lying down.
No more neutral zone. I was USED to hating Klingons... that's why I failed in our assignment.  It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word. Spock was right.
That cunning little Vulcan...
If they're even looking for us...
And perhaps with a large step or two. Like a peace treaty.
In space, no one can hear you sweat.
Ah. I believe you also consumed Romulan ale at the officers' mess on the night of question, Doctor?
Barely.
The Chancellor herself will testify that the defendant's hands shook.
Very much.
You crippled our gravitational field with a direst torpedo hit, and two Starfleet crewmen beamed aboard in magnetic boots and did this! WE HAVE WITNESSES!
He just tried to save him!
Isn't it a fact that you served Romulan ale, a beverage illegal in the Federation because of its overwhelming potency?
Yes...
I cannot confirm or deny actions which I did not witness.
Full diplomatic courtesy, Mr. Chekov...
I know what you mean...
First rule of assassination: always kill the assassins.
Now we go to Starfleet?
Give a girl a chance, Captain.
They'll be here...
There's a reward for your death.
Candidate for what?
Energize...
Aye, sir.
Right -
Only don't try putting words in my mouth.
Sulu!
Bless you, Sulu.  Where's the peace conference? They're going to attempt another assassination.
I'm afraid we may need more than that. There's a Bird of Prey on the lookout for us. And she can fire while she's cloaked.
Jim, there is an historic opportunity here -
They're dying.
Congratulations, Lieutenant. That must make you very proud...
According to the data bank, we HAVE - twice...
I'M going. You are going to be responsible for getting me out of this. Meantime we're not going to be the instigators of a full-scale war on the eve of universal peace.
I too was blind. I knew about HER - and I did nothing. I trusted too much.
Make ourselves a target?
Probably trying to figure out why we're reversing, wondering if we detect her.
Nothing, Captain. If they're here, they're rigger for silent running.
In the meantime we must endeavor to piece together what happened here tonight. According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
I'm having the garbage searched. If my surmise is correct these boots will cling to the killers' necks like Tiberian bats. They couldn't make their escape without them; nor can they simply throw them out a window for all to see; no - they're here. Somewhere.
I don't want to.
You can't prove any of this...
We've been ordered to -
I do not think so. Enterprise has disobeyed orders and harbors two escaped convicts. Admiral Donald will make certain all your ship-to- shore transmissions are jammed.
Signal Starfleet that... we have no idea location of Enterprise.
Then someone forged a data bank entry.
Thank you, Mr. Scott. We were to return to spacedock, the killers would surely manage to dispose of their incriminating footwear.
I was taken from my homeworld by people called the "PakJeds." They are fat. They traded me to a ship belonging to the "Bolians." The "Bolians" are blue. They put me in a seat and asked me questions. Then they were attacked by another ship...
No.
Because you are dangerous.
I know.
No.
No. Can I move now?
I wish I could believe that, Doctor.
But the Romulans abandoned the plan.
Dying?
To happy endings.
Yes. And, frankly, I envy them as well. They've made important choices; they're going to have great challenges ahead of them. New worlds to conquer...
You never know what's over the horizon, Data. Before too long you'll be offered a command of your own.
New worlds. Yes Data, brave new worlds...
Well... it seems we're truly sailing into the unknown. Keep at it. Anything you can give me would be appreciated. Dismissed.
Port thrusters, sir. Would you like me to drive?
We're about to find out... Power up disruptors and fire on my mark.
I aspire, sir. To be better than I am. The B-9 does not. Nor does Shinzon.
You are not looking at your- self. You are looking at me.
This is not an appropriate time for a conversation.
Do you have a name, sir?
Emergency force fields are holding.
I would like to pick you up now. May I do that?
With pleasure, Captain.
How could I not?
Permission denied. If you can possibly endure any more of these assaults.  I need you at my side. Now more than ever I...
This isn't about me anymore.
You sick bastard!
What do we know about the planet?
What do we know about the population?
He wants to look me in the eye.
Sir?
Ready, sir!
On screen.
There's more... as always. He's Reman.
Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...
What are you doing to Counsellor Troi?
There'll be another after me. And another after that. You'll find we're a resilient species.
Captain!
On screen.
Can anything be done for him?
We can only hope so.
Unless we can disable his cloak we're just going to be firing in the dark.
Yes.
You'll acquire a taste for it.
And if you had lived my life you would understand that there is a great respons- ibility in representing the Federation. I can't let my personal feelings unduly influence my decisions.
New worlds.
In time.
Don't be so vain. After we found it, we made a few modifications. An extra memory port, a hidden transponder. Perhaps your eyes will be a bit less confident when you learn I've gained access to Starfleet's communications protocols. I now know the location of your entire fleet ...  You may go.
What's this all about?
I won't defend my life to you.
But you want to.
I am.
He's a very unusual android.
Should I raise shields?
Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon. Geordi, get those shields online.
We're being hailed.
Yes, Praetor.
He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor.
A matter of hours now.
She is here.
They're holding position.
And mine is wearing thin, young man! We supported you because you promised action. And yet you delay and you waste your time playing games with Picard while--
There is. They came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses.
Thank you.
I understand.
I make maps.
Eh... yes.
It is beautiful.
Thank you.
Elmo's...
We'll get those answers when you find the one you're looking for.
When can we expect containment?
George, listen to what you're saying. This thing's changed itself into a man. Disappearing may not be that big a deal.
Washington thinks it's too late for that.
We'll do that. But how are we going to hold him? He can change himself into a man. He can disappear.
This is George Fox...
Okay...
No. You'll want to ask a lot of questions I don't want to answer right now. I already have a ride.
I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home.
What.
Good.
What are you doing?
No gas.
I am...
Closed.
Attendant. He'll give us gas. Put the gun down. Under the seat. Under the seat...
No.
You better.
Yes.
Three nights... two days.
No.
Why?
That's easy. I'll explain that in a minute. This is your ticket. When you get on the bus here, the driver will take this part. You will ride to Omaha. When you get to Omaha, ask the driver. 'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
I do not speak English.
The car will stop?
Are you my friend?
That was beautiful.
You can stop. I will go on alone.
Nothing.
You don't make money gambling. You lose it.
No, thank you.
I will.
You could have killed us both!!
I wouldn't worry about it... There might not be any little league tomorrow.
I did.
We're ready.
Save us all a lot of trouble.
Was there visual contact?
Parlez vous Francais?... Habla Ingles?... Sprechen zie deutsch?
Huh?... Eh... no, there isn't
You saw that?
I wouldn't think so.
If I talk to you, I will miss my ship.
I saw you play, man.  You were good. Like a fucking freight train I remember saying.  So what happened, injuries or what?
What's all this squid shit?
Joey, make sure Mr. Nero gets safely to his car.
Leave him alone, Tran.
Maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in.  It was touching the way you stood by me in there.  "Stand by your man". I was moved.  You were very good.  I don't think he even understands that you did it for him.
I'd love to.  But he keeps showing up.  And you keep talking to him.  I can't have that--
Fuck you.
'We might as well make the best of it.'
Too bad about your guy Jeriko. Tough break.
Yeah, OK, whatever you say.  Just answer one question.  Is anything wrong?  Iris said you might be in trouble.
It's Tran, isn't it?  This guy is poison, Faith.  Listen to me.  He's got you walled in on all sides.  And he uses the wire too much, he gets off on tape, not on you.
Damn right.
Iris is dead.  She was murdered.
Don't know.  But this guy's real damaged goods.  Iris knew someone was after her... and she said you were in danger too.  Now no more games, Faith.  Whatever you're hiding, whatever's going on, you have to get out of here now. Come with me right now.  Don't even think about it.
We should talk alone.
Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.
A virgin brain!  Well we're going to start you off right.  So what do you know about this?  Save us some time...
Exactly anything.  Whatever you want.  Whoever you want to be.  Fabri, get us another round, would you.
Okay.  It was funny.  But it cost me money.
Shutup a second!
So she feels... what he feels... while he's in her.  The thrill while he's killing her... is sent to her, heightening her fear... which in turn heightens the turn on for him.  I've seen a lot, Max.
Why me?
Is he dead?
Smoke.  Rumors.  I've heard stuff about a death squad.  A group a guys loyal to the hardline school.  Guys that've had too many years of city hall and the review boards and the goddamn media pissing down their necks, suspending cops right and left, tying their hands... while outa the other side a their mouths these same people're squealing save us, save us, do something you fucking morons, crime is totally out of control.
Yeah.  So don't walk near me in public, alright.
This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?
What makes you think I'm gonna kill Tran?
That's right.  They'll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment.  The one I left for you at the club was a copy.
I won't say anything.
You must be so pleased, I followed your jellybean trail right here, like a good little chump.
Naawww.
With all the blood I guess they didn't see the rig.  Guy had it under a wig.
I got ways, Lenny, I got ways.  Okay, okay... I got a deal with some a the paramedics.  My guy pages me and I pick it up at the morgue.  So whaddya think?  This clip's gotta be worth at least a grand.  Right?
Ha!  That's for fucking sure.
Wait, wait... wait a minute.  Iris was here?!
She never gave me a tape.
Yeah, important for your label. Which no doubt is why you're in mourning.  Don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead. You'll make out.
Strickland.
Your sex life?
They jerked my wheels, d'you believe it?  I mean it's outrageous, the computer errors the banks are making lately.  Have you noticed?
Sleaze to peddle.
Mace!  You're a life-saver.
Way I look at it, I actually perform a humanitarian service.  I save lives.
I've had enough of this shit.  You're on foot, Lenny.
Get it.
Look, I gotta get some sleep.
Snuff clip.  It was Iris.  She said she needed my help and I... aw Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker killed her.
Wants to share.
So the guy's not a sicko.
Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But why not just put a little lead in her ear?
Jesus, Mace!
This tie doesn't go with blue!
Easy, there, Mom.  Easy.  This is audio only.  John Coltrane.  "A Love Supreme." Give it a listen, let me know what you think, maybe you won't go for it now, but it'll get in your head and grow like a seed into something really beautiful.
It's okay, Lenny  They'd never get here in time anyway.
Yeah, me neither.  It was one of my favorites.  Me and Faith in a hot tub on my birthday.  I'm going to really miss it.
I can't tell you.  You've got to see.
Mace.  I know what you think about the wire.  But I'm asking you to do this.  It's that important.
I still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did Iris with those two cops.
How long does it last?  Oh.
Lenny... shutup.  Just park your mouth and listen.  It's a set-up. Think about it!  Why's he been sending you tapes?  To freak you, get you to rush in without thinking. Then they put one in you, put one in her, put the gun in your hand... crime of passion.  This guy's bent enough to think of that.
It didn't stop you from loving them. Right?  Or understanding them, or being able to forgive them...
You never told me.
Cheerios and wieners.  I made it myself.  It's good.
Sucks.  Hey, Bobby, turn that up.
Um... he was older.
Ten miles back on the Texas side.
Mack, this is Sheriff Dylan.
I sent a female in. The room in question was rented by an Anglo, cash; since then, nothing -- no activity, no phone response.
Tape it off, we'll want to fine-tooth- comb it. My guess is that the UNSUB is having us on. He checks in, pays, picks up the key, but never walks inside. Tell me if I'm wrong.
Mam, it's my truck. I know my own capacity.
You must get lonely. You ever think about, you know... 
What do you want from me?
I didn't wait on him. Fifty or so, white, regular build, needed a shave -- that's all I remember.
Put a BOLO out on that.
Just hospital talk. Nothing that connects to Speck.
Just an observer.
I had gotten their trust. We were sharing fantasies. I couldn't risk it.
Go ahead.
Had trouble sleeping last night, sir.
You suspected all along, suspected he was alive. That's why you came to El Paso.
What did you think of the Suspect Zero theory?
Collected shoes too?
An oversight, sir, I apologize. I felt I needed to get away for a day. The pressure. Paid for my own ticket.
I understand.
I need to get to Amarillo immediately.
I can't. The chat room isn't open for another five days.
Shut the fuck up or I'll shut you up.
The Academy, then CIIAC.
That information's being withheld from the media.
It explains a lot.
That's the beauty of the system. This is a fugitive chat room. It moves from place to place, chat rooms that are normally empty at certain hours: a gardening website, Chaucer buffs, a dating service. A pre- arranged code shows up in one of fifty porn rooms -- that's where I stumbled across it -- notifying "friends" to meet at a certain time, usually midnight to three Eastern Standard, at a certain website -- a deserted chat room, say, "How to Plant Perennials." Come Tuesday, twelve a.m., bingo, these like-minded deviates log on and start yakking it up: explicit sex crime gossip, who did what to whom, who wants to do what, when, why and how.
This is some serious shit.
What's this country coming to?
I know.
Jaime? Where are you?
Slow down a second, you met with Low --
I'm going to Amarillo.
Sit back.
Of course he does. Now get the key, get these things off me.  Unhook me.
I want to protect the boy. I also want to protect Suspect Zero -- from you.
No weapon.
Yes.
Yes, sir.
I've been reading, hearing about you. I spoke to Koessler, Professor Daitz.
I'm not sure, exactly. I had monsters on the brain. I wanted to get these guys, every one of them. I got obsessive.
Daitz hinted it existed. It was a matter of forming the request in the proper terms.
You knew it was me all along?
Whatever happened to MyDick?
Something came up, Murman, my man.
Lead the way, Murman.
This case has sent bells and alarms ringing all the way to Washington. Your old boss is coming out.
MyDick. As in my dick. That was his screen name.
What is it exactly I don't understand, Agent Mackelway?
Perhaps you can explain it to him.  It's Agent Mackelway.
Enough. I've got to use the phone.
Shut up.
...maybe...
What's that like?
I know! Starbucks! I served you an espresso at Starbucks.
I thought real men don't like quiche.
Tell me about it...
It does.
I don't know... To grow, to go out. Whatever you want.
I haven't heard an official "no" yet.
They were auditioning for the same role as you?
Don't worry. He's in good hands.
...And she's with someone else.
Could you believe it?
Uh, I don't want to bet it all.
Oh... right.
Sure, I guess. The phone's in the back.
Well... You can talk to a beautiful woman at a bar without worrying if anyone's watching you.
Listen. I had a great time.
I would love to see you again sometime.
Why, you like the duck with the cigar? 
You didn't have to get off the other line. I would've called you back.
I heard you might be moving back...
Right.
Ah, see, that's the thing. Somehow they don't come back until you really don't care anymore.
It's a gig.
...That's probably a more appropriate analogy.
Classy.
I know. It's like the opposite of inbreeding. The hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool.
Ah, there's the rub...
It's unbelievable.
Go for it, man.
She wasn't your type anyway.
I didn't make it...
Sometimes is still hurts. You know how it is, man. I mean, each day you think about it less and less. And then one day you wake up and you don't think of it at all, and you almost miss that feeling. It's kinda weird. You miss the pain because it was part of your life for so long. And the, boom, something reminds you of her, and you just smile that bittersweet smile.
You always know the right thing to say.
Hey Sue. Gretsky's on his ass again.
So, what? Eleven?
He's trying to be an actor.
I can't believe you.
What about you, Mikey? At least I got balls. You're always whining about some bitch who dumped you a year ago...
...Whatever. You're like a whining little woman. Big deal. You got a fuckin' number. Whoopee! You'll fuck it up...
Don't sweat it, man. I needed a kick in the ass. We're better friends for it.
Believe me, I know what that's like.  Yo, Double Down! What time are we leaving?
Hi, Nikki. This is Mike, again. I just called because it sounded like your machine might've cut me off before I gave you my number, and also to say sorry for calling so late, but you were still there when I left the Dresden, so I knew I'd get your machine. Anyway, my number is... 
213-555-4679. That's all. I just wanted to leave my number. I don't want you to think I'm weird, or desperate or something...  ...I mean, you know, we should just hang out. That's it. No expectations. Just, you know, hang out. Bye. 
I just got out of a six-year relationship. Okay? That should help to explain why I'm acting so weird. It's not you. It's me. I just wanted to say that. Sorry.  This is Mike. 
I don't know...
We're gonna spend half the night driving around the Hills looking for this party and then leaving cause it sucks, then we're gonna look for this other party you heard about. But, Trent, all the parties and bars, they all suck. I spend half the night trying to talk to some girl who's eyes are darting around to see if there's someone else she should be talking to. And it's like I'm supposed to be all happy cause she's wearing a backpack. Half of them are nasty skanks who wouldn't be shit if they weren't surrounded by a bunch of drunken horny assholes. I'm not gonna be one of those assholes. It's fucking depressing. Some skank who isn't half the woman my girlfriend is is gonna front me? It makes me want to puke.
What are you talking about? Vegas?
You're crazy.
I'm not going to Vegas.
I'm cool, baby. They're gonna give Daddy a room, some breakfast, maybe Bennett's singing.
Baby, we're gonna be up by five hundy by midnight. Vegas, baby!
Vegas!
What? You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us?
Who's fucking around? I'm not making fun. Let's do it, baby.
Leave? The honey-baby's bringing us some cocktails.
Whatever. We'll see. Daddy's gonna get her to bring a friend. We'll both get one. I don't care if I'm with her or one of her beautiful baby friends.
You can't think like that, baby. It's hard, I know. I've been there. Not for six years, but I know. You just gotta get back out there.
Oh fuck that. You don't have to try and impress anyone. You think I give a shit? You think I sweat that skanky whore waitress...
I should've said Renaissance, right? It went over her head.
Hello, Lisa. I'm Trent. What a lovely makeup job.
Hold on.
Don't worry about me, baby. I just wanted you to have a good time.
No, baby. You're money.
How?
See? And what does this guy she's with do?
What?!?
Please. And you're sweating him? You're "all that" and you're sweating some lawn jockey?
This version doesn't have fighting?
Aww... He got away?
It's on.
I don't know. It was kind of a dick move if you ask me.
We're not messing with you...
No, baby!
Yeah. I guess you could call it that.
Don't give me that! She liked you, man.
Oh. He's got it under control...
Chelios to Roenick...!
That's so bullshit. This is so bullshit.
...How novel.
Damn. Now I gotta go in early.
You are so money, and you don't even know it...
You're like this big bear with claws and fangs...
What'd you want me to do? Back down? He called me a bitch. We kept our rep.
...Whatever. Things are different here. It's not like New York, Mikey.
I know for a fact you haven't, because you never shut up about it. You're like a little whiney bitch...
...it's on.
...it's definitely on.
Be smart about it.
Good.  He never doubted you.
Yes. 
Good.  From me you'll get Justice.
Shut up.
Like hell I will.
Go get Paulie, I don't care how sick he is.  Pick him up yourself, and bring him to my father's house.
How bad will it be?
Maybe, or you gotta know now.
And what is the percentage of the Tattaglia family?
The Senator called--apologized for not coming personally, but said you'd understand.  Also, some of the Judges...they've all sent gifts. And another call from Virgil Sollozzo.
It's been two years.  He's probably in trouble again.
It's from Johnny.  It was announced this morning.  He's going to play the lead in the new Woltz Brothers film.
Mention it, don't insist.  Barzini is a man who will know that without being told.
Barzini.
For bravery.
For killing a man.
No.
Then why have I become a man like you?
Even so, I don't think it is safe here anymore.  I've made plans to move you to a villa near Siracuse. You must go right away.
Only the son of a Pezzonovanta.
Shhhhh.
You look good, too.
No.
Come here a minute, Fredo.
The Don has semi-retired.  I'm running the Family business now. So anything you have to say, say it to me.
The cops have it locked in and I got my people there visiting Pop all the time.  What about the hit list.
No, no Consiglere.  Not this time. No more meetings, no more discussions, no more Sollozzo tricks.  Give them one message: I WANT SOLLOZZO.  If not, it's all out war.  We go to the mattresses and we put all the button men out on the street.
No no, no more advice on how to patch it up Tom.  You just help me win.  Understood?
Yes.  That's true, you're getting a hell of a reputation.
Thanks Tom.
Did he give you his politicians?
Yes.  Tell me.
Michael...
Michael, I don't want to hear anymore...
Michael, I love you.
I told you you wouldn't like him.
My brother Sonny found him living in the streets when he was a kid, so my father took him in.  He's a good lawyer.
No, I would not like you better if you were Ingrid Bergman.
Huh?
Can I go to the hospital with you?
Goodbye.
Let HER ask.
Oh your father just had too many visitors.  It interfered with the hospital service.  The police came and made them all leave just ten minutes ago.  But don't worry.  I look in on him.
They want me to go to the conference with Sollozzo.  Set up the meeting for two days from now.  Sonny, get our informers to find out where the meeting will be held. Insist it has to be a public place: a bar or restaurant at the height of the dinner hour.  So I'll feel safe.  They'll check me when I meet them so I won't be able to carry a weapon; but Clemenza, figure out a way to have one planted there for me.  Then I'll kill them both.
Probably a year...
Is it all right if I go to the bathroom?
Yes, I promise.
Just be patient.
Be patient.
The hotel, the casino.  The Corleone family wants to buy you out.
You're unlucky.
Hell, he was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time.  Players couldn't get a drink.
Right.  Don't say my name, just listen.  Somebody shot your father outside his place fifteen minutes ago.
I think so, but I can't get close enough.  There's a lot of blood. I'll try to find out more.
Sure. Any time.
You just woke up!
Yes, Tom Ripley's here.
Meet my father, Herbert Richard Greenleaf 1st.
Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye.
Okay, darling.
No, I like him.
Okay.
Ripley. Hullo. How do you do.
No, still here.
Can you mix a martini?
This is so good of you.
Now your signature.  Not "Dickie". Your signature.
Freddie Miles. You know -- he's organizing the Cortina skiing trip.
I'm not going to say anything -- to Marge, or anybody, the police -- It's a secret between us and I'll keep it.
You can't blame him. You could hardly expect this to go on forever.
I mean it as a compliment. You've got such great taste, I don't know. Most of the thugs at Princeton had tasted everything and had no taste. Used to say, the cream of America: rich and thick. Freddie's the perfect example.
I knew it! I had a bet with Marge!
So tell me.
I'm actually a little relieved you're going, to be honest. I think we've seen enough of each other for a while.
You can be a leech -- you know this -- and it's boring. You can be quite boring.
Sure.
Which is horseshit. Have you heard him play that thing?  He can't.
In fact the only thing which looks like Dickie is you.
Have you done something to your hair?
Is it on "delle Croce, just off the Corso"? You're a quick study, aren't you? Last time you didn't know your ass from your elbow, now you're giving me directions. That's not fair, you probably do know your ass from your elbow. I'll see you.
Mr Ripley? I'm Alvin MacCarron.
What's going on?
Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans?
So I'm learning.
I'll go and see what's the matter.
Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks.
Ha. Did he say why?
Is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone?
I don't believe it. Wild horses wouldn't drag Dickie to --
Why do I think there's never been a Ripley rainy day?
I know it was you -- I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you.
He told me everything. I was supposed to meet him fifteen minutes ago, so I... I'm going to go now, I think. Unless he meant us to meet -- which would be a little cruel, wouldn't it?
No glasses.
I think we sort of found each other.
Excuse me?
Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.
What?
Is Freddie in Rome?
Hello Meredith.
I know. Look, I can't talk now. Later. Later?
He's taken over the case because... they're annoyed the previous chap let Dickie... disappear when he was the only, he was the only suspect in Freddie's murder.
Okay. Marge, see you tomorrow.  It's really good to meet you.
But the point is Dickie -- well we know this -- Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses...
Don't be daft. It's fine. I'm delighted you finally made it to Venice. I'm delighted, contrary to rumour, you're still in one piece?
It's okay.
What do you mean? They're sending someone from Rome?
No, but I thought that didn't happen in Italy, that each region was completely separate! I was sure that was the --
I don't know how to translate that.  E difficile... il signor Ripley... dormiva all'aperto, con un...
Il signor Ripley ha una fidanzata, il signor Dickie ha una fidanzata e probabilmente il signor Freddie Miles ha molte fidanzate.
No I did not. I did not kill Freddie Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf. Is he accusing me?  Ask him if he's accusing me!
Don't you put the past in a room, in the cellar, and lock the door and just never go in there? Because that's what I do.
You try. You try talking to her.
All kinds of things. Making plans.
I don't know. Both. My plan right now is to go up on deck, look at the sunset. Come with me.
Was who Meredith?
I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen you.
Dickie and Peter, that's just too good gossip, isn't it?
Well that would be even better gossip.
Peter, I... I...
Yes, if it's going to help, certainly.
Well, he certainly wasn't dead when he drove off in his car.
What about Thomas Ripley?
Does he stay with you here?
Let her in, what's the difference? Let her in.  No, actually, no, I'd like it very much if you would ask her to come back later.
Now I think I have upset you. My English perhaps is coarse.
I'm a good worker, Betsy mam, a real good worker.
My name is Travis.
South Bronx. The worst. I tried to ditch him, but he was already in the cab, so I had to take him. That's the law. Otherwise I would have picked you up.
I didn't mean you. But just ordinary people. A guy I know -- Dough-Boy -- met his wife that way. They got to talking. She said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop, taking her home with the flag up.
It keeps ya busy.
Oh. Who was that again?
I don't follow music much. I'd like to though.  Honest.
I bought a couple of tickets.
No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was just...
Well, If he had been Italian, they could have been shot off. Sometimes the mob does that to teach guys a lesson, If they blow a job or something.
Don't be naive. They can't kill everybody. They have different punishments for different things. Like, if they kill a stool pigeon, they leave a canary on the body. It's symbolic.
I don't know. Maybe they don't leave a canary. Don't be technical. What I'm saying is if this newsstand guy's Italian and his fingers are gone, maybe he's a thief.
We don't have ju-jukes. We don't have Coca-Cola. We only got Royal Crown Cola.
You said that?
Fuckin' Mau Mau land, that's what it is.
For a fee.
In the jungle. 122nd.
It's your time mister. Fifteen minutes ain't long.  That cigarette burns out, your time is up.
Easy.
I don't like my real name.
I drive a taxi. You tried to get away one night. Remember?
It don't matter. I'm gonna get you outta here. 
Don't you want to make it?  Can't you make it?
That fella "Sport" looks like a killer to me.
Huh?
Besides, I've got to stay here.
I can't say -- it's top secret. I'm doing something for the Army. The cab thing is just part time.
Cops don't do nothin.
I'm sorry, Iris. I didn't mean that.
Well, Iris, I look at it this way. A lot of girls come into my cab, some of them very beautiful. And I figure all day long men have been after them: trying to touch them, talk to them, ask them out. And they hate it. So I figure the best I can do for them is not bother them at all. So I don't say a thing. I pretend I'm not even there. I figure they'll understand that and appreciate me for it.
Why, thank you Travis.
Listen, son, you gonna get smart, you can leave right now.
Education?
Military record?
We hire a lot of moonlighters here.
Oh, lots. I don't know where they all are now. There used to be one standing over there. 
Why?
Oh?
Your name Sport?
Shit.
Yeah, Iris. You know anybody by that name?
Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio.
Yeah?
Yeah?
It happens.
You think I'm too...  ethnic for country music?
Archbishop of Canterbury.  Imprisoned and executed by Henry the Second ...
I'm a field agent.
For cottonmouth. Goodspeed and the S.E.A.L.s exchange looks.
The cell, Mason.
Partners.
Yes.  To wish someone a prosperous jouey.
Oh, yes.  Yes, he was.
The truth is, I'm a lot of things, but communist isn't one of them.
Damn...
Delly... thanks, thank you.  I'll take good care of this.
Pete, I'm so sorry about what they did to you.  I didn't think you'd come back, I thought you'd want to write again...
No, I... I just wondering where you've been all this time.
Yeah, a little.  I think you grew an inch or so.  And you've lost weight.
Why me?
Sorry.  You don't know how many times I've heard that.  "A lady lawyer?  Are you crazy?"  Like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man.  Or better, in fact.
Yeah...
Oh.
It's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, Delly.
Thanks.
Well, I'm sure we're all glad to see you came through it all right.
Are you asking this committee to believe that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl?
By all means.
That's... well, that's very generous, but if you've already got a store...?
Nine and-a-half years...
Oh, no, I...
Dad, I...
Bought the bottle, didn't I?  To the United States of America. Long my she wave.
Pete...
I... no, I... I just can't...
Wouldn't blame him if he was.
I... I don't believe this.
Leo, I was trying to impress a skirt.  You know me, I'm non- political.  Republican, Democrat, Communist, there's not a dime's worth of difference between 'em anyway.
Besides, I don't even know if I want to write anymore.
Leo, I didn't give them the names. I wouldn't do that.
The customers?  I don't know...
What exactly did you hear?
I wasn't alone.  Wasn't Frankie Ruskin directing the picture you're in?
Well, whatever Frankie's got, it's catching.
They're saying I'm a communist, Sandy.  But I'm not, you know that. I'm gonna fight 'em, and I'm gonna win, but I'll need your help.
Yes.  Very.
No.  Absolutely not.
It's a lovely garden.
Well, I'd really hope to rent it for...
I just picked up some things for the night at the general store. You see, I hadn't planned on spending much time here.
What do you mean?
Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother.  Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all.
Because she was afraid.
No, I don't think so. She's not afraid of losing her son, you see.  She's only afraid of being abandoned.
You get straight to the point, don't you?
It's what you said, Mom. Mr. Brinkmeyer's feed is no good.
In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Your brother's practice...
Take them.
She said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back East.
Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
I wish I could say. But if I could answer that, I could also tell you why people are trying to kill people.
Yep.
That's where the Brenners live.
Yep. Mitch and the little girl.
Follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left. That'll take you right around the bay to their front door.
Mmmm.
Down at the dock by the Tides Restaurant. Ever handled an outboard boat?
The little Brenner girl?
Impossible.
The crow is a permanent resident throughout its range. In fact, during our Christmas Count, we recorded...
What happened?
I don't think Miss Daniels is going to sue anybody.
A delivery, Mother. Miss Daniels brought some birds from San Francisco.
I don't know what good that'll do.  Chickens won't eat.
Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware.
That's right. We had a party here this afternoon for Cathy. Her birthday.
Oh, my God, look at her!
Where can we go, Mitch? There's no place to go.
We'd never make it. They're probably all over the road.
I'm frightened, terribly frightened. I... I don't know what's out there, Mitch.
What?
Annie's there. She'll be all right.
I think it might also matter to Mitch.
Shhhh. Shhhh.
What are we going to do about it, Al?
Well...  Well... these birds attacked us.
All right, I'll grant you a bird'll panic in an enclosed room. But, they didn't just get in. They came in! Right down that chimney.
Thanks, Al. We'll be all right.
These are for my sister... her birthday you see. As she'll be eleven and... well, frankly, I wouldn't want a pair of birds that were too demonstrative.
As the same time, I wouldn't want birds that were aloof, either.
Do you have a pair that are just friendly?
Aren't these lovebirds?
Those are canaries, Miss.  Doesn't this make you feel awful?
I was merely drawing a parallel, Miss Daniels.
A little birdie told me.  Good day, Miss Daniels.  Madam. 
Do you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a plate glass window?
I am.  Good day.  Madam. 
What made it...
No, San Francisco. What are you...?
What for?
I think we'll have to shave the hair. Deke, have you got a razor?
You are, aren't you?
Of course, how stupid of me. A quarter to seven, will that be all right?
Yes.
Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too.
Yes, I was lying.
Because it seemed stupid and foolish.
I don't give a damn what you believe!
Why?
What do you want ?
What do you do?
Like what?
I... I am.  Mitch, is... Mitch, this isn't usual, is it? The gull yesterday when I was in the boat, and the one last night at Annie's, and now...
A gull smashed into Annie's front door.  Mitch... what's happening?
It was like that yesterday.
It makes you feel as if they're... they're waiting or... resting... or....
I'm frightened, Mitch.
Yes. I was just taking her in some tea.
It... it doesn't look very different, does it? A little smoke over the town, but otherwise...
I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.
Almost two a.m.
Mitch...
What? Oh, yes, certainly.
No, you'd better send him. May I use your phone?
That would be just fine.  Hello, Charlie, this is Melanie. I want you to do a favor for me.  No, this is a small one.  Pressure you? Why, Charlie darling, would I try to pressure you?  Will you call the Department of Motor Vehicles for me and find out who owns this license plate? DKQ dash one seven six.  Yes, a California plate.  No, I'll stop up there in a little while. Is daddy in his office?  Oh. No, no, I don't want to break in on a meeting. Just tell him I'll see him later. Thank you, Charlie. 
There is very definitely a difference, Miss.
Thank you.  Do you know Dan Fawcett's number?
To...  To kill them.
No one called it a war!
I'm not sure, but...
They made some mess, too, smashing into houses and everything.  They always make a mess. We're better off without them.
Then let's go. Now!
Put on your coats! Do you want to get trapped here?
Of course -- it's the soul of the business -- the pay --
But can't you give me any idea?
Did he tell you about Georgina?
MacFarlane
I've heard of it.
Where can I find him?
But I must tell him -- he must know of it. Please -- tell me where he is.
From the Municipal Council -- they're the bodies of paupers --
Not if I have to be party to things like that, Dr. MacFarlane.
I remember her.
This girl was beautiful -- a wild lassie from the Highlands.
I can't believe that.
Pulse?
A burial party -- poor people -- it's hard to bury a loved one on a rainy day when the churchyard is so cold and lonely.
You couldn't do that, Doctor.
One shouldn't get used to the wrong things, Georgina.  You want to walk and run and play.
I am the best man for the job.
Maybe there's some private reason between you and me which will make you -- some long lost friend of ours.  Say that you'll do it for me and my friend, Mr. Fettes, here.
Don't call me that confounded name, I tell you.
That has nothing to do with it. We've decided to do more lecturing and less dissection -- it's better for the students -- that's all there is to it.
What are you talking about? I am an anatomist. I know the body. I know how it works.
I'll tell you what, Toddy. It's because I ran down the streets with the mud and the stones around my ears and the mob yelling for my blood. It's because you were afraid to face it -- and you're still afraid.
There is much in what I say, Gray, and if you have any regard for your neck you'll leave now and stay away from my house, my school, and from me.
I've ordered nothing from you.
I take no gifts from you.
So, Toddy, you've made me a disease, eh?
I have other means of sustenance.
Because it would be a hurt to me to see you no more, Toddy. You're a pleasure to me.
Burke them?
No, Doctor.  She seemed to get better, then about six months later she began to complain of pain in her back --
Yes, Doctor.
It comes at intervals.  They used to be months apart -- but they've been growing more frequent --  much more frequent.
Three years.
But, Doctor, surely in a case like this -- a child -- a little child who can never walk or run --
You sent them. I had no choice.
Yeah. I sure will.
I think we should get some support?
Who are you?
Nobody.
I know her friends.
I told you, I knew your sister.
When Lauren was missing the police came to our house. They said they were looking for her, right?  But I know now they had her, and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you...
I don't want to see!
I used to be so proud of him. My big deal daddy. And now, he's just a crook. Worse even. And the weird thing is...
It's not. I can't take it.
You mean Alex.
This guy said he was a friend of Lauren's. He had like paint all over his face.
The cop who found the knife in Corvis's car.
Lauren called me that when we were little. Daisy. No one knew but us.
That guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about Lauren.
Looks like you have them both on.
What a brilliant idea. I never would have thought of it.
He'll be there at 8:30.
My name is Klaatu.  I spent two days at your Walter Reed Hospital. Room 309. My doctor's name was Major White -- and I had a very attractive nurse called Ruth, who's getting married next Wednesday.  If you are not interested -- or if you intend to turn me over to your Army -- we needn't waste any more time.
No -- not at all.
Yes -- of course.
Something dramatic -- but not destructive.  It's quite an interesting problem.  Would day after tomorrow be all right? Say about noon?
That's enough, Bobby. I think it's time you went to bed.
Yes, dear. Come on now.  Bobby, your shoes are soaking!
He lives here in Washington, doesn't he?
All right.
Some places that's what people use for money. They're easy to carry -- and they don't wear out.
Thanks, Mr. Carpenter.
Their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty.
He says their medicine is that much more advanced.  He was very nice about it. But he made me feel like a third-class witch doctor.
From another planet. Let's just say that we're neighbors.
I mean the reasons for my coming here.
This is not a personal matter, Mr. Harley. It concerns all the people on your planet.
I want to meet with representatives from all the nations of the Earth.
I traveled 250 million miles. What about your United Nations?
Thank you... Have you any news?
I can judge only by what I see.
Is it real?
Come on in.
I feel different right now.
I'm not going to marry anybody.
I enjoyed every minute of it.
Naturally I think so.
May I walk out with you?
Yes--?
I -- I didn't really pay much attention--  Bobby has such an active imagination.
I'm worried about Gort. I'm afraid of what he might do -- if anything should happen to me.
I -- I thought you were--
This technique, in certain cases, can re-stimulate life for a limited period. It's a refinement of scientific principles known to your own people.
He'll catch on to it in no time now.
There are no diamonds like this -- any place in the world.
I'd give you a very good price.
You don't.
Think of this more as a survival manual... there's our number on the back, and pray that you never need to call us.
Exactly how many vampires have you actually destroyed?
We don't ride with vampires.
Santa Carla has become a haven for the undead.
Man, we totally annihilated his night-stalkin' ass!
Honda 250, huh?
Good idea.  Marko.  We're hungry.
What?...
If you ever want to see Star again, then you better come with us.
You're one of us, now -- aren't you?
For a ride.
Where the hell are you from, Kryton???
Now I get it... you're like those people in the airport trying to get you to give them money. You're part of a cult.
His fingernails are longer, but he always has bad breath.
Vampires, my friend.  Vampires.
What happens in tow and a half hours?
I don't want names!  Just lead me to him.  Where's their nest?
A big legal war wasn't going to improve anybody's situation.  We've all been through enough.  Besides I was raised better than that. Thanks for having us, Dad.
'Again'?  Dad... you haven't had company in this house since Mom died eight years ago.
You have a T.V.?
Lots more where he came from.
Gotta keep in practice.  It's a dyin' art.
This is Michael.
Who, Laddie?
No, Laddie.  It was a <u>memory</u>.
I like Michael.
I get off in another twenty minutes.  I thought maybe we'd all get a bite together.
No.  I'm up.
Can't.  Got plans of my own.
What's that smell?
Smells like something died.
Vampires, Mom!  Everywhere! You've got to tell the police! The newspapers!  The TV stations! They'll listen to you.  They'll believe you...  you're a <u>mom</u>!
This is not a joke.  They know that we know about them.  They're coming to the house as soon as it gets dark!
Do I look that needy?
I know.  It's so 'Eighties.'  It's the Cute Decade.
I hear this is the decade for cute.
Our batting average isn't very good is it?  So far we're zero for two.
It's you I was after all along, Lucy.  To be our day time guardian. I knew if we could bring Sam and Michael into the faimly, there'd be no way you could say no.
Okay.
No... no, everything's different now...
You're not going anywhere...  Sam...
Nowhere.
I can't remember much after the Chinese food that looked like maggots.
Piss off.
Don't turn on the light.
Nanook...
He was protecting <u>you</u>!
Screw it, I'm going up anyway.
No.  Just that he recovered real quick... That night when I found him in the rec room, he had already scraped off his bandage.  Before I put him with the others, I redressed his wound and noticed it had healed up real good...
Anybody sick?
Damn you, Blair!  You've already got everybody half-hysterical around here.
And I don't want any more food with sedatives in it.  I know what you're up to.  Don't think I don't.  And if anyone tries to get in here -- I've got rope.  I'll hang myself before it gets to me.
Watch him close.  Ask him why he didn't kennel the dog.
Cut, bullshit.  Been pulled apart.
If it did get to him.
Hell no.
That key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt.  Now how could somebody get to it without you knowing?
Who you trying to protect, mutherfucker?  I'm telling you this S.O.B. could be one of them.
No.  The generator.  You got the auxiliary box just off the kitchen. Get to it.  Where's the damn flashlight?  You fellas okay over there?
The dogs?
Cut the bullshit... Okay, Sanchez, you come with us.  Norris... you stay here...  Any of them move -- you fry 'em. And if you hear anything, anything at all you let loose the siren.  We all meet back here in twenty minutes regardless.  And everybody watch whoever you're with.  Real close.
Then I'll have to kill you.
Smart S.O.B.  He put it together piece by piece.
Maybe we should try and fix the radio... try and get some help.
If you're worried about anything, let's take that blood test of yours.
Could be important work.  Might as well bring it back.
I think so.
Nothing we can do about that.
A couple of hours.
After all this mess.
That far?
Well, stick to it.
No.
Damn if I won't.
One thousand volts.  Should be enough.
Copper thinks they swallowed pieces of it during the fight.
Screw the flashlights.  Where the hell were you?
It'll come.  It needs us.  We're the only thing left to imitate...  Give me a hand.
Just keep looking.
What are you going to do?  Drink it?
Anyplace but here.
What for?
So what do you make of it?
When do you think it got to him?
Hear what?
Can't hear you.
This is it?
But there's nothing here.
What are you?
Morlocks --
Oh yes... They found our knowledge useful for a time.  They used us much as your people did.  Then they decided they had learned enough so they tore us up for spare parts.
Excuse me?
Oh, shut up.
Yes.
The Morlocks didn't build this.
What can I do?  Tell me what to do.
You came underground when the world was ending above.  And you evolved. Some into the Morlocks and others --
Created?
As slaves.
How do you control the Morlocks?
I'm afraid your indignation is lost here.  I have no more "human" response to the Eloi then you would have to a carrot.  It's just how we live now.
Yes.  Initiative and daring are not desirable traits in the Eloi.  But you should be happy for her.  She won't remember the creature she was.  She will... become.
A man can change his history.
There's a cantilevered gasket on the --
You know I can't.
Let them.
I have something for you...
Somewhere around "D+2xy something something."
Tonight's the night?
Oh?
Perseverance.
I came by the house every day after the funeral.  And then every week. Then every other month.  Then I stopped coming.  Did you even notice?
For God's Sake, David --
You don't know that.  You couldn't possibly.  If I'd only done this, or that, if I'd arrived ten minutes earlier, or later.  If we'd taken a different path or I hadn't fought the man for the ring.  You have no idea what it is to relive every moment of that night -- consider every action you made -- and every one of them wrong.
I pray to God that in a week you're not here.
All right, all right -- here -- everything --
Thank you.
Mm.
You might find the truth rather hard to understand.
I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.
Allowed me to travel from my time to yours.
You can see so many here.
Then you came to a desert and mountains...
We all have that dream.
I can see Kalen's point.
Most things.  We're very high on purpose.
Orion's belt...
I know what it is to lose someone. When my husband was taken from us... I thought the pain would never end.
So you can use it now?
Ouch -- all right, wish me luck.
Here?
Well... perhaps I have "deviated" the tiniest bit.
Do they?
Animal husbandry is science, Dr. Hartdegen.  I have been breeding these fowl for fourteen years.  I have filled a library with information on their feeding patterns, social behavior and breeding.  Empirical, exacting, quantifiable records.
The advances you speak of were the result of countless years of study and empirical experimentation, a careful evolutionary process, not chalkboard parlor-tricks.
I did...
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
I suppose so.
Alexander, I know you're trying to help.  But they don't come back.
What's it like where you come from?
Kalen, right now you need to go up to bed.  You're exhausting Alexander.
Should we be what? Trying to change him any way we can? [Beat] Yes.
I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey...
You sure you know where to find one?
I didn't kill myself. I died from a blow to the head. How'd it happen? I have to know.
He didn't either.
They should just be looking harder.
I am. One of the few things I remember doing is eating. So I guess I must be exercising it off in my dreams.
I can't take you out of here in your condition...
No, it hasn't.
Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?
Dog tags. [Off her blank look] They've got your name and date of birth for identification.
I'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat] but I'm not lying to you.
[Beat] What?
How?
No, you didn't. They found William Starks' body dead in the snow.
I don't know.
I know. It was perfect. [Beat] Erase my sanity and you erase anything I'll ever say.
Because your body can only take so much of what they're putting you through.
When we first met, when you were 7, where was the house you lived in with your mother? Do you remember your address?
I see you've done your homework. [Beat] Alpine Grove's undergone a lot of changes since then. At the time, we didn't have the...resources to help our patients the way we needed to. [Beat] Now, we do. And things are different.
I guess I'd ask you why.
Why would we do that?
I didn't see that much of it -- same as now. I only saw it as part of my own life.
Maybe.
Because of the future. I know what's going to happen.
How...how do you know?
What for?
You still don't believe me, do you?
Or just plain stupid. You'd think by the twentieth time, I'd have found an alternative method. Maybe a more effective one, if you know what I mean.
[Cutting in] MacKenzie, listen to me. Listen. I'm going to die.
No. [Beat] I mean I found out while I was in it that my body's gonna be found in four days.
[Beat] I'm not deaf.
I'm not sure. [Beat] I don't really know.
Why "of course"?
You know what? It's Christmas Eve. And you look clean -- I mean, you're normal-looking. [Resolutely, for her own benefit] It's Christmas Eve, and I have a couch.
The best I could do with what was in your fridge.
You remember it?
Yes, baby?
Well, maybe if they were trying to hurt you or one of the kids.  I'm sure I could shoot someone if they tried to hurt one of the children.
You might say we had a meeting of the minds, yes.
Now that you mention it, they might have been a little bit jumpy.
If waitin' tables in a bar don't make you an expert on human nature, then nothin' will, and I could've told you that Harlan Puckett would end up buyin' it in a parkin' lot. I'm just surprised it didn't happen before now.
Well, you'd best get something. Even if they didn't do it, it times out that they most likely witnessed it.  I want somebody to at least talk to 'em.  Put out an APB with a description and see what we get back.
Why don't we go ahead and let the bureau in on this.
I know!  I'd tell you if I knew! Goddamn!  I know something happened, or she wouldn't have left.  I'm trying to remember everything!  Find that fucking kid.  He probably knows something.
Oh, great.
A .38.
The important thing is not to let on that you know anything.  We want to try and find out where they are. Now I don't want to get too personal, but do you have a good relationship with your wife?  Are you close with her?
My Lord.
What for?
Shut up.
Yup.  Thanks for the ride.  You all take care.
Well, not anymore, Thelma, except for bustin' parole, I haven't done one wrong thing.
God.  You're a real live outlaw!
You're a little angle, you are.
Who's your friend?
What the fuck is going on?
Of course.  Of course!  Where?  Can't I bring it to you?  For God's sake, baby, please, just tell me what's happened, what could possibly be so bad?
Can't it go to any office?
That's the code word.  I miss you, peaches.
Who is it?
Jimmy, my daddy's still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that...
Why now, Jimmy?
I don't know.  It doesn't even matter anymore.  I just want you to be happy... It's not that I don't love you either.  But Jimmy, your timing couldn't be worse.
Oh yeah.
Am I in trouble?
What kind of stuff do I bring?
Okay.  I will, too.
It's Bob's, the day manager's.  He's gettin' a divorce, so his wife's gettin' this place, so he's just lettin' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys.
Tell me somethin'.  Is this my vacation or isn't it?  I mean, God, you're as bad as Darryl.
Well, I've had it up to my ass with sedate!  You said you and me was gonna get outta town and, for once, just really let our hair down. Well, darlin,' look out 'cause my hair is comin' down!
Yeah!
Can't you tell when somebody's hittin' on you?
Givin' him a taste of his own medicine.  Asshole.
In the meantime, you said we were gonna have some fun.  So let's have some!
West.  Left.
Our next move?  I'll say one thing, Louise.  This is some vacation.  I sure am having a good time.  This is real fun.
So this is all my fault, is it.
My stuff's in the trunk!  God!  You care more about that car than you do about most people.
I think better when I drive.
No, I didn't tell him.  And that's something we gotta get straight. Darryl's been callin', mad as a hornet, makin' all kinds of noise. When you talk to him, you cannot say anything about this.  You gotta make sure everything sounds normal.
Thelma, I'm going to Mexico.  I think I can make it in two and a half days, but I'm going to have to haul ass.  Are you up to this?  I mean, I have to know.  This isn't a game.  I'm in deep shit.  I gotta know what you're gonna do.
Don't you fall apart on me. Goddamnit, Thelma.  Every time we get in trouble, you go blank or plead insanity or some such shit, and this time... Not this time. Everything's changed now... Now you can do whatever you want, but I'm going to Mexico.  I'm going.  Are you coming with me?
It's probably not a good idea.
I don't want to go that way.  Find a way that we don't have to go through Texas.
Oh shit, Thelma!!  Shit!  Shit! Shit!
Jeez, Louise, tapped the phone?  You think so?
They don't know that!  It was just you and me there.  I'll say he raped me and you had to shoot him!  I mean, it's almost the truth!
What.
I... I...
You're right.
Yeah.  Those.  That always put the fear of God in me.  What about you?
Gosh.  It sure is.
Just ignore him.
Just asking.
It's good.  It's what the pioneers ate.
Okay, okay... I've got some tequila. You want some tequila?
Eeuww.
We can change our names.
It'd have to be pretty good.
Yup.
Yeah, right.  We're not gonna get caught.
Oh.
You too, sweetie, the best.
All this for us?
What are you talkin' about?
Say you're sorry.
Jeez, I didn't catch it.
Hitchhikers? I don't know -- fifty... a hundred maybe -- Who keeps track?
Just one pair! You owe me that much, you heartless bitch!
Each day is better than the next.  Have you ever been, you know... in love with someone?
Look, I admit it was brief, but it was definitely love. Crushes don't last twelve years.
I told you, her family moved to Miami.
I also called Unsolved Mysteries.
They told me they don't help out stalkers.  Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time.
Well... at least now you know.
I'm sorry, it's just that you're taking this all wrong, pal. Don't you see? You're liberated. I feel liberated. I mean here you've been in therapy thinking you blew it with the greatest girl ever, and it turns out that getting your dick stuck in your zipper was the best thing that ever happened to you!
Uh-huh.
Remember our friend Healy? Well, I didn't know where to mail his last paycheck so I sent my assistant by his mother's apartment. Turns out there is no diabetic mom. Landlord said she's been dead for ten years.
No! You've gone through way too much to back down now. Get over there and do something -- I can't stand watching this.
Just relax. Have you hit the cash machine?
Mints?
No.
Huh.
Who?
Oh come on, why would I lie?
Call you back.
Nah, some guy threw me a few bucks to track down his high school girlfriend.
Am I?
Ah, fuck ya then, you big pussy. What are you, spotting?
Yep.
Dumbshit.
Thanks.
Thanks.
Some buildings I'm working on.
What's that?
Isn't that a little politically incorrect?
-- He's in a cage?!
Look, uh, I was thinking maybe we should go have dinner sometime.
Wow, I've never seen him like this. He doesn't usually like guys.
What say we get outta here and go crush a bucket?
Have you seen it?
Wow. I thought I was the only one.
Come on, what were you going to say?
Huh... that's strange.
Warren!
Not to worry. So... see you tonight, right? Right?
You can't be serious.
You get fifty a day, period. It's a business trip, they'll pay for your expenses.
Really?  Very, very?
So you found Mary?
Huh?
Ted? Don't you want the name of the housing project?
Good good.
Rollerpig? Are you nuts?
Your turn?
Why the fuck would I do that? I'd be screwing myself.
Kim and I are close friends!
You mean him.
Did you build the Estadio Olympico?
Oh look, it's Doob! Will you excuse me a minute, Tucker?
You heard me, goddamnit. I... I love her.
What do you mean?
But... but you knew people at Harvard.
All right for awhile? The guy's good- looking, rich, witty. He was a god.
Is that old crab still with you? Mary, you said you were putting her up for a month -- it's been a year and a half.
I confirmed it on the scanner. I knew something was up because Puffy used to bark like hell whenever he saw him and you know Puffy only barks at bad people.
Name's Patrick, I met him at the driving range.
Oh, yeah, of course, dear.
Why?
So maybe I could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies.
Love? Come on, I wouldn't call it love.
Puffy, get over here.
The little shit lied to me about that guy!
Where's Puffy?
No no, the bigger the better.  But I must say, they could be a little brighter. Nothing's sexier than a mouthful of pearly whites.
Well... I've got a little more news about your friend Healy.
Okay, just calm down. It's going to be okay.
Oh Jesus...
No, it's an old football injury.
A real Clydesdale, huh Warren?
Oh, I don't know. I think proms are pretty dumb.
He's dead.
Funny story. You see, me and a buddy of mine decided to... ah... you know... just... drive down.
Jeez... that sounds awful. Hey, what do you say we go out to dinner tonight, catch up on old times?
Hm?
That's more like it.  Two more nitrate-sicles please.
Yeah?
We'll see. If it doesn't, what the hell, at least I gave it a shot.
Look, Mary, the truth is... I'll be in town for a while now but I don't think we should see each other for a few weeks.
Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take Mary to the prom.
I was playing a trick. I-I-I had a baseball.
You got what stuck?
What do you mean?
So what's up?
I don't mind. If you think he can hold me.
Bye, Ted.
With all due respect, Mr. Secretary, we were not firing on the ship. Firing on a ship means attacking the ship. We were not attacking the ship. We were firing over it.
Where the hell are you?
We keep 'em in the dark as long as we can. But I sure as hell am going to test him.
Then you'll call, right?
That's all well and good, but what do we say to 'em?
...I know. CIA and the military fucked us on the Bay of Pigs.
Helen and I went out for breakfast. EXCOM's not supposed to convene til eight.
So now you've got to talk him out of it. And then we've got to figure out an acceptable political solution.
Because we knew we could do a better job than everyone else.
Kenny. It's over.
No, Ken. I need to see him now...
Then they should speak up.
Yes, sir. Our best option is to commence the strikes before the missiles are operational. The invasion happens eight days later.
I'll be evacuated with the President.
-- we got a back channel communication from Khruschev this evening feeling us out about a deal. He confirmed it just a little while ago in a letter to the President. I think we've won.
Tell you what. We're in Connecticut tomorrow for Ribicoff. I'll get you up front with him during the flight.
Dean Rusk!
No you weren't.
Acheson's scenario is unacceptable. And he has more experience than anyone.
You're scared to cancel on Daly.
Maybe it's harder for them to say it than they let on. At the very least, they believe it's in our best interest. And at the end of the day, they may end up being right.
Any problems, you remind them those chains of commands end at one place. Me.
And we can't purge the Chiefs. Our invasion talk will look like a bluff. Or even that there's been an attempted coup.
Then somebody'd better deny it publicly.
You're sure...
And if this is a move to appease the hard line, then it may just be the bone he needs to regain control of his own house.
That may be what they want us to think.
Just a second, Mr. President.
Rug samples.
The only good Indian is a dead Indian, does that old adage still hold true out here?
James Looks Twice?
Sioux Indian, right?
No, Ray. You're gonna have to blame that on your grandmother.
You crashed my file?
Ray.
We'll have to give Leo a refund. Because he's gotta go to the M.E. In case you don't know, Officer, violation of the Major Crimes Act on --
I think Leo's retired from quillwork for the moment.
Get the plate numbers off everyone of these cars.
Jimmy Looks Twice put Leo's head through a glass door of the tribal offices three months ago. And threatened him several times since. President Clear Moon and the regional FBI feel he made good on that threat.
Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty?
Whoever dusted Leo, dusted him from the driver's seat of a moving car then drove those eight miles to the Badlands. Jimmy Looks Twice has never been behind the wheel of a car. It's a known fact out here that he's petrified of driving. His parents were killed in a car wreck.
-- I know. I fed it, and I can't get rid of --
Thanks, Cooch.
All I could think of was... not here. I don't wanna eat it on an Indian Reservation, three thousand miles from home.
She's that subtle?
Well, she's running now, too. These fucking people like to run, don't --
Yes.
The Little Walking River. You're right. This is part of it. So whoever sunk this car didn't compensate for drought. Goddamn.
Sorry, Cooch. I lost Eagle Bear --
No way, Cooch.
Let the press through.
Is that right? Well, listen to this: drag your ass. This is a restricted area.
He wants to know if you ever watch the Cookie Monster. He says the Cookie Monster is not to be trusted -- a trickster.
Sacred herbs. Tobacco. Don't worry, we don't smoke no Mexican agriculture in The Pipe. That's a white man's myth. This is a sacrament.
-- Leo Fast Elk was sitting in the outhouse at Maisy Blue Legs when a car pulled into the yard. He came out, approached the vehicle then saw that the man behind the wheel was Jimmy. He tried to get back into the trailer, but the car came highballing at him. He started running for the open grass. With the car moving, Jimmy hung his shotgun out the window, took aim -- missed once, hitting the shitter -- fired again, and severed Leo's spine. Leo fell, rolled, and came to a stop in the grass. And some chicken feed. Stale chicken feed with four days mold.  Electromagnetic printing.
Go catch Jimmy, Ray. Really. He's gettin' away. Go ahead, go get him. I'm late.
A what?
What's real to you? Wall Street? Capital Hill? Now they are myths.
No. I was sent here cuz I'm Indian. And a good cop.
Crow Horse, listen. You have to come with me.
No. So we can do what the old man said. Red Deer Table, Walter. We have to go.
We've driven a long way. Where is this place?
Yeah. Fitful dreams.
What we need... is Richard Yellow Bird.
He's looking at a few hundred years in Leavenworth. He's not gonna come out without a fight.
He hasn't left this place in twenty years. They got him.
We're going for The Stronghold.
You didn't have another vision...
If you ever need a place to come back to and listen to the trees a little... we'll be here.
You forced an innocent man to run like an animal. You've tried to poison my people's hearts against me with your manipulation, with letters I never wrote... you've been watching me eat, work, raise my family... wash myself in the river. And now you're here, arresting me at a sacred place.  In your eyes, that's power.
Wa-shee is like... a dumpling. Like tallow we put in stew. I think he was calling you chubby boy.
Okay, Ray. I'm coming in. If he starts to leave the area, move in. And hold him. Over.
Ray. What's your 20?
-- yes, Teton Sioux. Father's side.
They sent me here, Richard because they said you didn't hold up your end of the arrangement, and I have to transport you back to Leavenworth.
Red Deer Table! What's with you, man?
Was there ever a girl who didn't like fighter pilots?
No, I beg yours. But I don't think you're right on that.
I saw a MiG do a 4 G negative dive.
Where were you?
No.
You know, I'm assigned to this school. I see sixteen new hotshots every eight weeks. Your attention is flattering, but not really productive. Why don't you keep your mind on flying.
What are you talking about?
Don't worry, I'm a new strain. And I don't give up. Everything I've ever wanted I've had to work like hell for. Well, how about it?
Okay, anything. Just...go. I've gotta work.
You're an animal.
It's not suffering anymore.
They know the rules... That's the deal. That's why you're up there. It's him or me. That's the price of admission.  It bothers you, why? You're part of it.   Everybody dies. Most people don't get to die for something.
Thanks very much.  Care for some suchi?.
I'm fine.
Maybe I shouldn't take it.
Where are we? You know where we are. It's called the beach. It's where life first crawled up out of the sea. I come here sometimes... when I feel like crawling back in.
I don't think so, but if that's what you want...
What do you want?
Not as silly as some. You know the silliest one? ...that we are gods. That we control events on the beach... that we can turn back time...
What truth?
That's three.
Well what?
Yes sir!
WHAT'S MIG ONE DOING?
It's a MiG 21. They don't have radar missiles!
You.
Bring it left. Bring it left, You're high.
What?  What is it?
You're not. We're level. Look at the instruments, we're okay!
NO. NO GOOD.
Roger, I've got it.
Okay.
Yeah, I guess it is. We did it! We did it...Damn! We sure did it!
But I have to!
Any more MiGs?
Like what?
Who's your pilot?
No shit. The Iceman....
Could use a dash more jet fuel.
Hey, see any controls back there?  And anyway...we beat the Son of a Bitch!
What, been drunk? Sure! Plenty!
Yeah, he's married--but then again, he,s not dead.
He should've had me. GOOSE Take it down. Let's bug out of here. Call for a draw.
I wouldn't call it victory.  It's more like...self immolation.
I've had enough...for now.
I guess that's what I'm doing, then.
Thirty seconds. That's all it took to blow us out of the sky.
NO, I GOT HIM. I CAN TAKE HIM.
You don't owe me anything. We're on the same team.
Figured out what?
Nope.
I think I can work it out on my own.
Yeah, we get one of these guys every damn class.   "Maverick!"
Three guesses.
Didn't everybody?
Yes sir!
I know. I was there.
My wife's house.
Or....
Over there man.
Ah, shit.  You got me.  I ain't even married.  Now put your fucking hands in the air!
Hey, I got four kids to feed.
How'd you find me?
Get it, please.
No, sir.
Who told you to think?!  I don't give you enough information to think!  You do what you're told!!  That's what you do!
I've been trying to tell you.  Someone erased his memory.
Sleazy...and demure.
This is going to be very difficult for you at accept, Mr. Quaid.
Up!
Aw, come on, baby...You're the girl of my dreams.
You know I do.
Do what?
I'm late.
Bye.
The job's real. -- But the Agency set it up.
Doug...You wouldn't shoot me, would you?  After all we've been through?
Mars.
I'm not interested in Saturn.  I said Mars.
Come on, don't bullshit me.
Smart move.  Now while you fill out the questionnaire, I'll familiarize you with some of our options.
Whatever you say...Just answer one question.  What is it that is exactly the same about every vacation you've ever taken?
There's something I have to tell you...
I didn't lose it.  Cohaagen stole it. He found out that Hauser switched sides,-so he turned him into somebody else.  Me.
Then he dumped me on Earth with a wife and a lousy job and ...
You never loved me, Hauser!  You just used me to get inside.
Melina, please...People are trying to kill me.
I used to model for 'em, why?
The reactor.
Aliens built it.
It's just up ahead.
I just has a terrible thought...What is this is all a dream?
No problem.
You can't fight'em that way...
My cannon.
Phone's out.  Road's out.  We're on our own.
Yeah, whatever they are, you'd think after they ate all those sheep they'd have to take a dump someplace...  What the hell's going on in town?
Damn!  Val, we can't get them.  Never figured on having to shoot through dirt!  Best goddamn bullet stop there is.  Come back.
We sell 'em to you for three bucks a piece!
You're never going to believe this, but the canyon road...we were on it not two hours ago...well, it's completely...
Right.  We're gonna run.  Get ready.
The mountains are solid granite. We'd be safe there, and we could hike along them...all the way to Bixby if we have to.
Son of a bitchin' lowlife, putrid, scum...
Why?
I thought you called it your pecker.  Look, don't make the mistake I made.  Twenty years of looking for a woman exactly like Miss October 1968, and where'd it get me?  Here with you.
Damn it, Val!  Not having a plan is what keeps us doing jobs like this!
Okay, the plan is: pedal to the metal the whole way.  We don't stop till we hit the carwash, not even to pee.
Hey, I don't want spend the night out here!
Yeah!  Next time I tell you I'm not hung up...!
Great.  Thank you.
That <u>is</u> the plan...I mean, goddamn it!  What the hell are those things?  How could they bury an entire Plymouth station wagon?
Maybe it is.  Why don't you take a little stroll and see?
First let's see if Stumpy's still out there.
<u>I'm</u> best at driving the Cat.
Don't worry about me, jerkoff.
Not going to pole vault anywhere. That's for sure.
Civil?  I'm civil.
Yeah, Heather, we got you.
Am I sure?!  It was right there.  There's the cord.
God, what a stink!
Yeah, vibrations in the ground.
Yes, see, they move very easily through the Pleistocene Alluvials...  ...the dirt...the loose soil that makes up the valley floor.  But they can't move through solid rock. I think we should travel west to the mountains.
Like <u>what</u>?!  There's nothing left that'll make it to the mountains!
Wait!  How are you going to know they're all following it?
Sustained.
Complain to the Bar Commission.
Your Honor: I imagine that, no matter how careful my questioning, Mr. Ortega would, in his well-intentioned way, dig my client's hole even deeper.
Let's snuff this lowlife!
What about entrapment?
We had a description of the suspect.
I'm not a kid anymore, I can't be all over the map --
Ossining Correctional Facility. Sing Sing. Everybody's innocent there, man... Just ask 'em...
Chinatown street gang.
Eight years ago. The Chinatown hit.
Easy? No... We have to find some piece of evidence that got buried, to reopen the sucker.
"Cecil Stipe"? Have we seen any affadavit with that name?
"Have to"? No...
Saving it for the Sunday Times.
George is a fucking burnout case. I didn't want him on the stand anyway. Get more names from Billy.
What's Art Esparza?
I've seen this picture before.
Christ... Shu is innocent.
... An hour.  That's why I thought the morgue was on the other side of town.
Neither.
Forget it. You've blown your chance to participate in this case, Kitty.
"Dowd also reports that his team of private investigators..."?
But I like that theory. And since I'm not putting Twerp Professor on the stand, and since I don't have a better theory, I'm sticking with that theory. Meantime I want pictures of the Joes. What'll you bet there was a guy in the gang looked enough like Shu to fool the eyewitnesses!
I'm a professional, Eddie. Getting paid is all the thanks I require.
Eddie, if I wanted to make love with you again, I'd do it sober.
...Okay...
About Chinatown. What went down.
I don't know shit, man! Goddammit --
By trusting me. Shit, man...
Good. Now we're going to take an affadavit from you, but only concerning the facts of the Chinatown shooting. We honestly don't give a shit about the Kennedy assassination.
Mr. Rabin has no right to --
What am I looking for? You're the one talking deal.
You know you're very tense, Mr. Reynard. Y'oughta take a week off, fly the wife and kids to Oahu.
That's big of you, Bob.
We just discovered him, your Honor! His appearance is critical to a fair presentation of our case! He is an inmate at Ossining Correctional and --
I didn't say he was an informant. But since you mentioned it, wasn't Esparza your primary informant?
-- Eddie told you?
I'm Roger Baron. I work with Edward Dowd.
And its purpose?
Yeah, we do some of that.
I'm a soldado in the G-Wing Regiment.
No! They g-got the wrong guy! I saw it! The killer wasn't Chinese.
The very fact that we are talking about word association means we are in a space that was opened up by our practice of word association. The world is a hologram, Albert.
Blonde.
Maybe our biggest. I'll see you two doors down from your place at 11:00.
Here he comes.
You killed Mike.
Baby laxative? We can't snort baby laxative.
Thanks, Bobby.  And my little round friends, too.
Thank you, Carl.
Did she have someone with her?
You can tell J. Edgar that I was at a party and I got fifteen fuckin' witnesses.
I think I'll take off my badge as well.
NO, IT'S OREGON, PORTLAND, OREGON. IT'S REGIONAL BUREAU CHIEF COLE. OUT IN PORTLAND OREGON. I NEED YOU OUT HERE, CHET.
COOP, AGENT CHET DESMOND HAS DISAPPEARED. GONE LIKE THE WIND IN DEER MEADOW.
Stanley, I heard all about it.
Someone else has it now.
You are here and there is no place to go...
Sure, but let's finish up with this first.
Agent Desmond, would you hold the finger for me. There's something up there.
I think that's a good idea.
May I see the magnifying glass, Agent Desmond?  There doesn't seem to be enough detail in the photo to ascertain the design on the ring.
Faulty wiring.
You didn't do your homework?
You know, I think you're right. I'm just too adorable.
Maybe.
Okay, I suppose I should go home.
I just want a friend. Just one friend for just one minute...
Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.
If I can smoke it.
You mean Fred and Ginger?
YES YOU DO, DONNA. What a downer you are!!!
Okay, I won't wear your stuff... Why can't I wear your stuff?
Not you, Donna, not you.
I know you are and you don't have to do anything crazy to prove it.
I can't help you there.
And I love you, too. But don't wear my stuff.
I did? I didn't see anything.
I'm not.
I already made you two tapes.
How can I be together if I'm not together?
Okay.  Oh god, it's Johnny Horne's birthday today.
I can't tonight.
"Oh, Laura..."
Eating?
They were looking for wood.
What were you doing in my room?
Ben asked him to stay late to plan for the Norwegians.
But my name isn't Leland Palmer.
Fine.
...school's fine...
Not really.
A friend from school.
Leland leave her alone... She doesn't like that. Stop it.
Nothing, I chickened out.
There's no one here.
All right. But let's keep the price down. I've called Ed Concannon. He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.
Yes.
Mickey told me to come back to work.
Frank Galvin's... who's calling please? Bishop Brophy's office...
No.
Yes.
Yes.
I...
After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in. He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.  And he told me to change the form. He told me to change the one to a nine.  Or else, or else, he said...  He said he'd fire me. He said I'd never work again... Who were these men...? Who were these men...? I wanted to be a nurse...
That is correct. I was engaged to render an opinion.
Just as you are, Sir...
No.
Through, through his book.
Meth... Methodology and Technique...
'Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.' Yes.
Objection.
Frank Galvin. We've met before.
...to get her heartbeat back...?
Nothing further, your Honor.
...one moment, Mr. Concannon...
Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
...that's all right.
Hold on a second.
You ruined my life, Mister... Me and my wife... and I am going to ruin yours...  You don't have to go out there to see that girl. We been going four years.  Four years... my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister.
What you thought!? What you thought... I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct?
No. No thank you, Doctor. You go home.
Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life. They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
Right. Who called?
Her doctors murdered her. They gave her the wrong anesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.  Her doctors murdered her.
What are they going to do? Not invite me to their Birthday party...?  Look, I gotta go. I have to be in Cambridge...
...that's perfectly all right.
To do right. Isn't that why you're doing it?
How old is he?
Yes.
My client can't walk, your Honor.
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
That happens.
I'm an attorney on trial before the bar. Representing my client. My client, do you understand? You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
Overruled...
I changed my room at the Hotel.
We, we... No... we just had a small reversal in the case...  I have some, uh... I have some work to do...
They, uh, they got to my witness.
You're talking like a drunk.
No... no...
From the magazine?
Kathy Price.
Missus...
We get it at work. We get the magazine at work.
I've got nothing to say to you.
You know, you're pushy, fella...
Well, maybe you better do that, then.  You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores. You'd do anything for a dollar. You got no loyalty... no nothing... you're a bunch of whores.
It's locked.
...I know. I went...
...I understand...
Yes.
Dr. Gruber's not in.
Yeah.
What the hell do you think you're doing...?  What's going on here...?
Fuck you. I got a call today from Sally Doneghy...
...You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them...
One lousy letter eighteen months ago... I try to throw a fuckin' case your way...
We've got her sister. Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
Yeah? And what are you going to do tonight?
I've got to go see Gruber.  What's the best cigars you have?
Mickey: I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's, I can't make it.
Yeah.
The Doctors.
Yes, that's correct.
We, we were rather busy...
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
Huh. And why is that?
Yes.
The Big Boy did...?
That won't start no more fires.  We might's well go home.
We'd be in all the papers!
Come on out!  We're friends!
We had a chance...We could have stopped them!  The mob stole the trucks and smashed everything up.  The fools!  They cut their own throats!
What's he like?
Automobile ignitions are insulated.
No.  The air's going to be full of Jets in a minute...And there they are!
I bought it for the square dance. I thought I ought to wear some- thing Western.
I feel like I did one time when I was small.  Awful scared and lonesome...I'd wandered off - I've forgotten why - but the family and whole crowds of neighbors were hunting for me.  They found me in a church.  I was afraid to go in any place else.
I could wear it longer -- but it's less trouble this way.
Yes ...  Fits better in a football helmet.
Right.
Welcome to California!
Sort of a trial balloon.
What?
You've got to get back on the horse some time.  Look, you've had a nutcase making harassing phone calls.  I know how scary that feels.
Okay, but it still doesn't mean it can't be over with.
You probably were half awake and saw me get nicked by that picture glass.  Dreams work like that.  You want me not to go on this job?
Chase, you'd better come home.
Is he all right?
They are...it happened in tonight's quake.  It happened just fifteen minutes ago. You must've felt it.
He was just here!
Everything is not fine!
He can follow the breadcrumbs, right?
Not sleepy.
No, I don't think so.  You just have to...pray, or reach...
I honestly don't know. Try to sleep, baby.
Here.
Read me some?
Yeah...how'd you know?
The way he's writing is so weird, who knows?  I asked him how far he'd gotten at the funeral, and what was it he said...?  Oh yeah, as far as Dylan trying to reach God.  Weird, huh, that he'd have your kid in it?
When it is denial.  I don't think that's the case here, but if you're really worried, have a doctor check him out. You'll see, everything's fine.
Six weeks of this, and you're surprised you've got Freddy in your dreams?  Hell, Sonny Bono says after a while he was seeing his stalker everywhere.  Even at Mass.
Yeah, sure.
Yes.
Listen, dammit.
Thanks.  Just give them the time he called.  They're keeping a list, supposedly.  Sorry.  My nerves are so raw these days.
Exactly.  The problem comes when the story dies. It happens a lot of different ways, the story gets too familiar, or too watered down by people trying to make it easier to sell, or ti's labeled a threat to society and just plain banned.  However it happens, when the story dies, the evil is set free.
That's not what the dreams say he's doing.
Choice?  What kind of choice?
Now that you have a child, is it possible you've decided horror is bad for children?
And how about your co-star in NIGHTMARE I.  Would you trust him alone with your child?
Really!  Listen, Heather, I won't take but a minute of your time.  It's just that we have something to propose to you, and wonder if you'd stop by the offices. Bob'd love to talk to you.
No time like the present.  The car will bring you.
Coffee'd be nice.
Skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side.
Everybody down!  ON THE DOUBLE!!
Fifteen.
What do you mean?
That's what they get for not locking the door.
I'll tell you who you are.  You're the glue.  You're the thing that holds everybody around you together. You're strong, you listen and you see things in people the rest of us can't.  It's a gift.
It was a bad dream...
Like this!
That is the point... And Skipper'll slip off the hook.
Me too.
Yes.
That's like wondering if your mom and dad do it.  Who wants to know?
My dad.
Yes sir.
They have every right Chuck.
I can take care of myself.
Look, you put me on this boat in the first place.  I didn't want to come but I did.  Why do you have to embarrass me.  Why can't you just leave me alone?
It's okay.  I'll be in, in a minute.  Look, what do you want?
You do?
They're in a hurry to grow up.  They don't know about consequences or responsibility.  That's being sixteen too.  I promise you one thing...
I can show you how to use a slide rule.
Why would you do that?
Trust me donut.  I know.
On the dog watch, night after the storm, I look down into the skylight above Skipper's cabin and there she was, peelin' down.
I figured it out.
I don't have to listen to this.
You will if you wanna eat.  Right George?
What's that?
What?
Long enough.
I'm not staying out here.
He climbed when he was ready.
Is it true that the reason you expelled Philip Boutillier...
... and that you invited him to strike you?  To fight it out on the deck of your ship?!
I understand.
No.  I didn't.
Don't mind him, Chucky.  You're talking to a guy whose idea of big romance is a palm full of Vaseline.
Why? He's right in the groove.
So you're gonna be needin' the "blue- bird" pretty soon?
No, he's out changin' the oil in the car.
Ready for another?
She really say she was pregnant?
I ain't fuckin' sure, Bobby.
She's my girl... She's drivin'... That bother you?
That's right... Take one of these.
Told ya I would. You still riled?
What's the name of it?
You say it's straight ahead a mile?
Real good, Chet... It's been awhile.
Set one up.
No sir...
Whattaya do there?
Sailor... Lula loves you.
If you are truly wild at heart, you'll fight for your dreams... Don't turn away from love, Sailor... Don't turn away from love... Don't turn away from love.
The real joke is we never went fishing, but we're still fishing.
Sailor ain't a murderer. You got to get off that kick. And far's I can tell, Sailor was entire clean prior to that involvin' Lula. Even there he was protectin' her. You oughta be thankin' him for that. That Bob Ray Lemon they say was comin' after the both of 'em. Why am I tellin' you this, you was around that night. You ought to know just exactly what happened. Sailor just got a little too forceful is all... You remember that night...
I'm stayin' right here by the phone until you find Lula, then I'm comin' to get her. You call soon's you got somethin', even if it's three in the a.m.
Listen, Johnnie, Lula just called me. She knew you were in N.O., so they left the city.
I'll be damned if that wasn't a wrong number?
Did I tell ya it's great to see ya again?
And?
Started he couldn't remember things? Got real violent? Mama kept tellin' me it was on account of lead poisoning from cleanin' the old paint off our house without usin' a mask... But I don't know. Seems like his brain just fell apart in pieces.
How'd it happen, peanut? He just pull out the old toad and let it croak?
And you never told nobody about it?
One hundred twenty decibels - head on collision of a '54 Ford Pick-Up and a '64 Chevy Station Wagon. No survivors. Balls of flame and grinding metal.
We didn't have no TV up at Pee Dee, baby, you know?
Twenty-three months, eighteen days is all. Don't need to make more'n it was.  This couple's goin' on a date to Hawaii. The girl chose him over the other two guys.
There's worse things that can happen to a man, honey.
Oh, baby. What a bad boy you are!
You're excitin' me, honey. What'd she do?
Poor baby. She don't know what she missed. What color hair she have?
Lula... I learned somethin' interestin' today on a science show I heard on the radio... How leeches is comin' back into style.
Shhhhh... It's four o'clock... That woman's laugh the other day had somethin' to do with this feelin'?... Like bein' ripped apart by a gorilla, maybe... Grabbed sudden and pulled apart real quick by a real powerful one.
Anythin' interestin' in the world come out of somebody's weird thoughts, Sailor. You tell me Sailor, who could come up with shit like we're seein' these days?
I was hopin' you would. I know that night by heart. Sometimes, honey? I think it's the best night of my life.
Too bad they don't give an award for talkin'... You'd win first prize. Especially with those tits.
Well, I ain't upset about it, darlin'. Just give me an odd feelin' there a minute, is all.
You do.
Where?
Lula, darlin'... Makes no difference anyway... We're outta here.
He's just a regular guy't needs help, honey. Look at him.
Honey, we bein' strangers here and all, this is the kinda place we don't want to make nothin' of nothin'.
I want to call her and tell her I'm okay. That we're okay.
Leave me be for a minute? Mama gets all insane and then I see you practicin' your individuality and personal freedom with some oil-town tramp. How you figure I'm gonna feel?
I can't take no more of this radio...  I ain't never heard so much concentrated weirdness in my life, Sailor Ripley, you find me some dancin' music right this minute... I MEAN IT!!
You know, Lula, I never told you what all I was doin' before I met you.
Well, there's a good side as well as a bad side to it... The good side is I knew your daddy, and I thought Clyde was a good ol' guy...
No, Sailor darlin'. Just shockin' sometimes when things aren't the way you thought they were... I been carryin' a secret too...
...They was laughin' arm in arm like animals.
Well, we're really out in the middle of it now, ain't we?
If you say so.
What's that?
Not quite as bad as the weather though... It must be a hundred and ten and it ain't even noon yet.
No radio or TV...
Let's get a sandwich and find out about some work.
Maybe. Met a guy named Red, owns a garage, could have some work in about a week. Met a few hard luck boys who's stayin' here. What's that smell?
I know you ain't particularly pleased bein' here.
I know this ain't easy, Lula, but I ain't gonna let things get no worse, I promise.
You talk to 'im some?...
What?
He ain't never known me, Lula, so there ain't much for him to forget. Not seein' each other for six years makes it next best to simple for us, too.
HOLY SHIT!! IT'S THE NIGHT OF THE LIVIN' FUCKIN' DEAD!!!!
You know who it was and you know you aren't, and I mean ARE NOT gonna see him EVER... End of story.
Why, how could I not worry? Not knowin' what's happenin' to you or where you are? Are you with that boy?
Mama, Sailor's in deep trouble here. I just can't leave him.
You ain't takin' Pace, though.
Well, you be careful with that boy, Lula.
HELL NO!!! That's the last thing we need... A buncha cops runnin' around.
Lula's gone off with Sailor.
Yes.
Yes... Get rid of him.
All right... I want you... to... kill... Sailor... As simple as that.
That's your business... I don't care how.
Shoot him.
No.
See! I knew you had it all under control.
Hey... Stop the nervous cry-baby routine... You're my girl now... Santos is gonna wipe away those tears and make you happy... Come on, let's get outta here.
So?
You're gonna have to kill me to keep me away from Lula.
It's a prob'lm I don't think's gonna go away too soon though... Peanut, I'm thinkin' of breakin' parole and takin' you out to sunny California.
Just passin' through on my way to who knows where...
Life is unpredictable.
Thanks...
Fascinating. Listen, why don't you come out with us after the lecture. There's a place on the Hill I always get Trip to take me.
So I hear.
He's right, you look horrible.
Ah, right. Well, I gave you my opinion.
I sweat blood for five years and he checks for spelling.
Your wife.
Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great cities.
She's still a transvestite.
This morning. I found a note in the kitchen.
Tripp.
Just go around him.
Shit.
Tripp, where the hell...
What? Ohhhh. Is that... it?
Nothing, he's just been sort of, I don't know... kidnapped.
His parents.
Love. It's Love Parade -- and what do you mean 'based on what you've read'? You skimmed two chapters at 80 miles an hour while gargling methamphetamines.
So sensitive.
So what's the problem?
First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car.
'That's my car, motherfucker.'
No wonder he screwed us over.
Oh, right. Oola. About that jacket...
Gee, I don't know, Crabs...  Improvise. You're good at that.
I peeked.
Jeff. Sorry. I didn't even know this was your house until about an hour ago.
How long have you been smoking marijuana?
Move away, cupcake. He's got a gun.
'Fraid so.
Just what? Doing a little dusting?
...You carry firearms.
No! What gave you that idea?
They really hated it. I think they hated it more than any of the other ones.
It doesn't matter. It only took me an hour to write.
So I'm told.
Does she want to hear it was one of her professors?
She is. Ah. Here we go...
Mmrrmmm... KNAP SAP!
I thought you might -- I don't know -- swallow your tongue or something.  I guess you really miss her, huh?
Nothing, it's just that, well, it's been awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some people -- some of the kids in workshop -- thought maybe you were...
No one seems to know where you live, James. Hannah thought you'd like my couch.
Well, James, you did shoot the Head of the English Department's dog and steal his most prized piece of memorabilia.
Well done, James.
So where have you been staying?
Your aunt?
I never heard of it.
Your father worked in a mannequin factory?
That's right. That one.
How can you tell?
Jealous? Of me?
I never said that.
Shut up, James. You're annoying. Carrie and Howard don't know what the fuck they're talking about, okay? The entire class combined -- including the lovely Hannah Green -- has about one tenth of one percent the talent you have, okay?
And don't be so goddamn sensitive. Who cares what anybody thinks anyway? You want to be a good writer? You want to be a great writer? Then stop giving a damn what other people think. Most of them haven't thought in years.
Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't have spells.
I eat.
When nobody's looking.
Okay.
Nowhere. You just sit here and... eat.
James, like it or not, they're your parents.
Don't be. I don't care if they expel me. I probably should be expelled.
Yes, James.
James is odd. I know he has an aunt in Sewickley Heights. I dropped him there once, but...  Come to think of it, it wasn't even his Aunt's house. He said she worked there. Or something. I don't remember.
Hh-uh. Last time I saw it was...
I told you, Sewickly Heights.
Walter just got it back from the framer today.
You love Emily. I know that. And you need to stay with her.
She'll come back. That's why I'm going to... to not have this baby.
It's -- it's a souvenir. Of Baltimore.
James Leer.
It seems one of our students is -- missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed.
I think I might've said I was in love with you.
And you're old.
I told Walter.
What's that?
Yes?
I... I...
Oh... yeah.
Sick.
I was thinking of you.
A jockey? You mean, like --
That's weird.
No, I'm going ho --
Mr. Crabtree was saying how George Sanders killed himself, only he couldn't remember how.
Just a few then. The big ones.
Took some talking to convince your super I was a relative.
No shit.
K through sixth.
What?
How is she?
When can I see her?
Huh?
Yeah. It's really nice.
It wasn't like that.
She's got all this new furniture now. She said it didn't fit anymore, so I kept it in the attic. I thought you might like it.
The birthday party.
I don't want to see any goddamn pictures.
I'm not a monster.
Ask me. Ask me anything.
I mean... feelings.
Sure.
Why not?
The mother sure has her hands full.
You'd be surprised how many kinds of birds you'll see here. Last week I saw a purple martin. And the week before that, I saw a solitary vireo. That's rare.
It's a bright sound.
You live around here?
Me? Nah. I'm more of a people watcher.
It's my bird book.
I'm not pretty.
Then you won't mind if I look around.
Got something to hide?
I could get a search warrant.
You can't talk to me like --
I have a passionate girlfriend.
You are in.
Why's that?
Well, Mary, you're about as helpful as a broken sewer pipe. You do know what runs out of a sewer pipe, don't you?
Do you have many friends?
How come?
It sounds like you were banished.
Birds are my friends. That sounds egotistical, but they are. Birds know I watch them, but they don't mind because they like being watched... if they know you won't hurt them.
Yes?
Your daddy will always love you.
That was a joke.
What?
Honest? No.
I don't need someone else.
You know why. It's part of the parole deal.
Talking to you is like riding on a merry-go-round.
What is your idea of being normal?
I know --
I want to talk about it now.
In my bed, Rosen. Where do you think?
Yes, a nap. Kids do that. You ever take a nap, Rosen?
Did you and your sister often take naps together?
All right.
It was a small house.
I'm all right.
What picture?
Neither do you.
What do you think?
What?
I'll buy a plant.
K through sixth.
Yeah?
What for?
When I do sleep, I sweat a lot. Usually I get nightmares and wake up screaming.
Hi.
Because I like you.
Twelve years in prison?
I told you I'm not easily shocked.
Why young girls, Walter?
No. That's what I used to tell myself.
What?
What?
I'm not scared.
Guess that makes you pretty special.
Fine.
What is that?  You drop your dive light?
Folks, I've just been told to shut down the hole and prepare to move the rig.
Missile compartment.  Those are the launch tubes.
Hey, you okay?
Figured I was dead, there, when I seen that angel comin' toward me.
Your rig?
Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it.  The Suit.
No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks.
His mixture got screwed up.  He panicked and pranged his regulator.
It's trying to communicate.
You noticed.
Deepcore, this is Cab One.  We need assistance, over.  Deepcore, this--
Aaargh!!  I'm freezing!
It's the only way, Bud.  Now trust me.
Tell me later.
Okay... Hippy's not going... McWhirter, you can run Little Geek.
I'm not interested in your way of doing things. Just get your team ready to dive.
Let's go, guys.
Now we're right in the middle of this big-time international incident.  Like the Cuban Missile Crisis or something.
That's it then.  Finler, McWhirter, Dietz, and Perry.  Jesus.
Yeah, for now.  Our first priority's to get something to breathe.
I can't... make it... podner.
What good's the money if your dick drops off in six months?
We've been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman.
That's 192 warheads... And how powerful are they?
We got Russian subs creeping around.  Shit! Something goes wrong they could say anything happened down here, man.  Give our folks medals, know what I mean?
That guy's crazier'n a shithouse rat!
He couldn't be that dumb.  The guy's a trained killer.  Bud's idea of a fight is arm-wrestling One Night over laundry duty.
What's the timer set for?
Very good.  About one person in twenty just can't handle it.  They go buggo.  They're no way to predict who's susceptible, so stay alert.
Bud, according to Monk here, you just set a record for the deepest suit dive.  Bet you didn't think you'd be doing this when you got up this morning.
I know how alone you feel... alone in all that cold blackness... but I'm there in the dark with you, Bud you're not alone...
Through three miles of water?   I don't know.
She'll wait.
What a question... Because I want to be with you, naturally. I hope he doesn't close the deal so he'll leave me alone at least for a few days... Isn't this water wonderful!
Fine. Can't you see so yourself?
But you just said that a month was too...
I'm certainly not going to swim across.
Four or five days.
Without any doubt, sir. If anything belonging to the girl who has run away is still here on this island...
I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to put it that way. But, you must understand, sir, that I...
Sir, if you have no objections, may we start the search?
That's Patrizia's way of letting us know she's with us.
And how do you explain that?
I know. I keep asking myself what I could have done to prevent all this from happening.
It takes even less.
And what about you?
Yes... but it's all so conflicting... However, there is some slight indication...
Are you joking?
But just think -- the very same things you had said to her who knows how many times... maybe even just before we left, while I was waiting outside your place...
And why did you drop them?
And are you sure you want to marry me? Are you really sure...that you want to marry... me?
Hurry up now, or it'll begin to get hot outside...
Nothing.
Good night. Tell me that you love me.
I deserve it.
Better dead.
One would have to be in love with somebody to know that.
Calm?... He doesn't seem so to me... He was awake all night.
But aren't you tired? I can just about manage to stand on my feet!  Raimondo!
It was futile. We went all over.
No.
I think all you have to do, Giulia, is to close the door.
You must know your third grade geography book inside out.
There's a shark in the area. Don't move from where you are!
Do you know why? Because if you saw those ruins I'm sure you would have said they were very, very beautiful. You always say "how beautiful" to everything -- whether it's the sea, or a baby, or a cat! You have such a sensitive little heart that it throbs for anything.
Please, Giulia; must you always emphasize the obvious? I can see for myself that the weather is changing.
I was saying... it might even be possible that Anna had left with them.
This is Claudia, Anna's friend...  You've never met my husband, have you?
Ask her.
And where do you find the models?
I thought the model was something obsolete nowadays. Didn't you, Claudia?
Now, we're getting somewhere! They're beginning to contradict each other.  Now look here, your friend just swore to me that you weren't able to do any fishing at all because the sea was too rough... And what about the other boat?
Now look, my men saw it and they also saw you men throwing those crates overboard. What have you got to say about that?
They told me that you were a very nice girl, that you always mind your business... In other words, things of that sort.
But for you, what comes first: music or love?
From Panarea. Why?
Ettore must be fed up with me by now.
Lady Patrizia!
Claudia isn't coming with us. Will you please take care of her luggage? Thanks.
You're kidding!
Why?
Who?
Oh, for Heaven's sake.
Agnes...
Your mother tells you this?... Agnes your mother is dead.
Nonsense, I'm your mother now and I want you to eat.
Dear Jesus...
Yes.
Hasn't anyone ever told you that before?
What would you like to talk about.
God!  But there's nothing to say about God.
Love.
Oh, yes!
In the confessional.
Where did the baby come from?
The baby they made up.
Agnes, how are babies born?
Martha Louise Livingston.
Not at the moment, no.
I can't have them any more.
No... do you?
She said all of God's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. I liked that.
I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head.
Where did you go?
She'd get angry.
From someone who didn't want to have a baby.
A mistake...
I can't help it if I'm stupid.
Not my fault.
Everything... I don't have children.
Alright.
Yes.
No.
Yes.
It grew.
I'm afraid.
Fish...  ... brussel sprouts.
Someone's following me.
Sister Marguerite I think.
Above the bed?  Any... anything else? What do you you see, something different?  What is it?
What do you think it's there for?
I don't know which one 
Yes.
Why?
Who?
Agnes... Agnes...
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
She... left me alone with that little thing, and I looked at it, and I thought this is a mistake. But it's my mistake, not Mommy's. God's mistake.
I gave you the pictures Marty, what else do you want?
If I find anything I'll call you.
I can get you new evidence next week.
Uh huh.
What business is it of yours..?
No-one.
Yes.
We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits.
Obviously there was.
Look, someone gave her the baby.
I am not with the Inquisition.
What's your opinion?
So, someone else could have done it.
I haven't said anything against the the Catholic Church.
And she has a right to know that there's a world out there filled with people who don't believe in God...  ... and aren't any worse off than you Mother. People who've gone through their entire lives without bending their knees once, to anybody. And people who fall in love and have babies and occas- sionally are very happy. She has a right to know that. But you and your... your order and your Church have kept her ignorant...
There's another choice.
Aquittal.
Nothing.
The twenty third of January. On that night one of our elder nuns passed away.
Yes.
Bullshit!
So you left the Church because you had freckles?
Saint Peter?
Right...
There are no saints today. Good people yes, but extraordinarily good people... those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking.
Yes I do.
You think she's a saint?
Well give me a reasonable explanation
This is insane.
Then why are you so obsessed with her? You're losing sleep over her?  You're thinking about her all the time. You're bent on saving her. Why?
Why would I lie?
Where is she?
I didn't guess until it was too late.
The scandal...
I didn't hide it. I put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets.
What happened to the baby?
... Oh, I'm all heart, Ma'am, all heart ... Well, I let ...
We'd be thrown out.
Hoop, this isn't a hoop, it's a lethal weapon. Have you got a licence for it?
Shurrup!
Just you?
Ding Dong? Oh Ding Dong Bell, eh?
Not much cop without 'em, is it?
How about Ding Dong?
The police station.
And hurry, they're not looking too happy.
Spoil sport!
Oh, yes, now I'm with you. [he changes his accent] But, gee, Mister, I've got my license to think of ... we're doing a hundred now ...
Eh ... don't call him sir, he's got enough delusions of power as it is.
You've got an inferiority complex, you have.
Bag-snatcher.
Oh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?
Have I said something amiss?
A butcher?
I suggest you just give him the photos and have done with it.
Now what's that supposed to mean?
He's sulking again.
Wake up!
We do.
Oh, I'm sorry, I must have made a mistake.
Well, what happened?
Eh, there's only three of them.
Well ... go 'head, do the next bit.
I've got you worried, haven't I?
How'd you guess?
I'm in a group ... well ... there are four of us, we play and sing.
I only enjoy acting for myself. I hate it when other people are let in.
Is she?
Me? Oh, I don't have the time, I'm always running about with the lads ... no, we don't have the time.
Parading?
Well, I <U>am</U> living, aren't I?
I'm not wrong.
Oh, they seem all right to me.
Eh?
What's he on about?
I'll look after meself.
Before you go, I think it's only fair to warn you about me Grandson ... don't let our Paul have his own way all the time, 'cos if you do he won't respect you!
Why do you always use your left hand?
And I take a left-handed view of life, I've got to.
Don't mock the afflicted, Pauly.
Here, Pauly.
For Ringo.
You're undressed. Where are your clothes?
Well, me mother thought the trip 'ud do him good.
He's got you worried, then?
Come on speedy!
Sit down, the lot of you.
You wouldn't!
Hi, our lot!
Now, look here, Norm ...
What?
No, not me.
I would have said so.
Oh, leave off!!!
Well ...
Your Grandfather pointed out Shake was always being taller than me just to spite me.
Aren't we ...
Have done, and you lot get your pens out.
Good lad, Ringo.
Oh, down the ... er ...?
Clever.  George.
And they want me?
Get knotted!
Oh, anything you say, Paul.
A proper Aborigine.
Nine hundred meters and dropping. 800.  700.  Hang on gentlemen.
Or something will be able to see us.
But functioning.
No, it's too small, only room enough for one person.
No, I want to go in.
Wretched.  What happened to me?
Unknown.
Yes.  There are two points of salient interest.  Number one: it is highly systematized, indicating intelligent origin.  Number two: certain sounds are inconsistent with the human palate.
It is none of the 678 dialects spoken by technological man.
The reaction has proceeded too far. The core has begun to melt.  Engines will overload in 2 minutes, 35 seconds.
Right.  Talk to you.
Yeah!
It grows on you.
Shit...
That way.
Bulbs burned out, nobody bothered to replace 'em.
Don't know -- maybe we'll be real lucky and he just broke his neck.  I knew we shouldn't of come down here.
Is it alive?
The water will still recycle.
-- And the cooling unit on the other.
Right.
Here, let me try.
Meet us on the bridge.  Be careful -- it's <u>huge</u> now.
It's eating a hole in the floor!
We'd be sitting ducks in the freezers.
Boy, that's terrific.
It wouldn't come.
Careful, don't get under it!
How's Broussard?
Still unconscious?
Sounds like a rough one.
Oh my God.
I don't buy that.  There's still time to destroy it and get ourselves in the freezers.
The computer just translated the goddamn message.  It's not an S.O.S. It was a warning.
Just can that crap!  I'm in command here till Chaz returns!  And nobody's leaving this ship!
Jay, this is Cleave!  Meet me at the main air lock!
I guess I had it coming.  Let's call it settled.
Hey!  what about the film?
And the creature with it.  We can make it back to Irth in the lifeboat.
Thanks for the thought. 
Well... this rock rotates every two hours.  The sun should be coming up in about 20 minutes.
Who knows?
It'll yank him right off his feet if he's not expecting it.  The line could get tangled in something.
Maybe we should just wait a few more minutes.
We can't even radio for help; the carrier wave wouldn't reach its destination till long after we'd died and turned to dust.  We are utterly, absolutely alone.  Can anybody really visualize such a scale of distances?  Halfway across Creation...
Time and space have no meaning out here.  We're living in Einsteinian equation.
Are they close?
Let's get moving with this net.
Close...
About four hours.
Good!  Moisture content?
Found what?
Well... it's obviously intentional... some kind of attempt at communication... maybe it's a symbol that means something to them...
Tell you what, Martin.  As soon as the engine's fixed --
Good.
They seem native to the planet.  It's got an atmosphere and a dense gravity.  It's dead now, but once it must have been fertile.
It started crashing around right after we locked it in.
Right... but it'll take a few minutes for the engines to overheat and melt down the core.  In the meantime, we get in the lifeboat and leave the ship.
What can I do?
The head's okay, but I could sink a six-pack.
Do you wanna head back and call it in?
God, I hope that thing didn't bring down a virus.
Thanks.
Nah.  I just wanna squeeze off a few rounds.  'Sides, they tagged the rhinos for the migration project, so they're protected.  They'll dock you a month's pay for just mentioning it.
Oh man...
Yep...
And?
You win some, you loose some.
Match it!
Has anybody talked to them?
One more sweep... one more sweep.  I'm getting tired of one more fuckin' sweep. We're been lookin' for this thing for three days now, and found zip.
Hey!  I was in shape before we started doing this.
That's what I mean.  This is the quietest I've ever heard it.  It's unnatural.
I've seen this mother, De Vries.  We can bag it, no problem.
What's wrong?
Just behind us, over to the right.
How?
Couple more seconds!
York just turned up outside.  We're trying to get him into Infirmary.
Nah.  It's got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for remote operation.  Someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and running.
Uh-huh.
Just give them the facts.  They can leap to their own conclusions.
We haven't used Big Bertha since we relocated the generator module. That was four months ago.  I can't ask for them to keep bringing spares in on the shuttle, it's already costing too much as it is.
Real man' drink.
Nothing.  With the satellite down, we can't transmit over the mountain range. He's most likely sitting there wondering why he can't raise us.
Agreed.
I'm out of ammo.  Get inside, get inside!
I... I can't!
Yeah, exactly.  Those're pre-programmed course adjustments you're looking at.
Yeah, 'Good Evening' to you, too.
It's a very famous name, Mr. deWitt.
Certainly, Mr. deWitt...
Even so. One isolated pretty good performance by an understudy. It'll be forgotten tomorrow.
Just some coffee.
Nothing of the kind. Karen and I had a nice talk.
All paved with diamonds and gold?
Lloyd and I.
What else?
We sat and talked, Addison. I want a run of the play contract.
- it's important right now that we talk. Killer to killer.
No-no-no...
You're being childish.
Well, I can't yell "Oh, butler," can I? Maybe somebody's name is Butler...
What makes a man walk into a lion cage with nothing but a chair?
And too many of them are produced.
Hear, hear...
You were there? At the play - last night?
Being violently ill to her tummy.
Over? It can't be. I've come to read with her. I promised Max.
Of course I knew.
How nice.
A mass of music and fire. That's me. An old kazoo and some sparkles. Tell me - was Bill swept away, too, or were you too full of Revelation to notice?
The implication being that I have not been reading them as written.
Show me a human and I might have!
Eve. I'd forgotten they grew that way...
As of this moment you're six years old...
Bill? Have I gone crazy, Bill?
A big hurry, be quick about it - so good night, darling, and sleep tight...
And who remembered it? Who was there on the dot, at twelve midnight...?
She hasn't missed a week since I left - but you know all that, you probably tell her what to write... anyway, I sent her a list of people to ask - check with her.
Cut it out.
She's a girl of so many interests.
Clyde Fitch, thought you may not think so, was well before my time!
What about her teeth? What about her fangs?
You know nothing about feelings, natural or unnatural.
I understand she is now the understudy in there.
What would you like? Texas?
Groom.
Eve. Eve Harrington.
Why.
Why you have to go out there.
Are you proud of me, Bill?
I'm in love with Margo. Hadn't you heard?
But she just got here...
What did you expect - live sables?
I never played Fort Sumter.
I couldn't get into the girdle in two an' a half hours...
Night an' day.
Well, I certainly think it's odd he hasn't even come up...
With changing and everything, a little over an hour.
But if I'd known... maybe some other time... I mean, looking like this.
Try...
I think I'd better. It's been - well, I can hardly find the words to say how it's been...
Hollywood.
Karen.
But Mr. Richards and Mr. Sampson-
If I thought I'd offended her, of all people-
I don't intend to be.
It could have been - fifteen years ago. It's my part now.
Not at all...
I was dreadful, Miss Channing, believe me - I have no right to be anyone's understudy, much less yours...
Well - if I'm not in the way...
They are lovely. Aren't they lovely, Birdie?
Very becoming. It looks better on you than it did on me.
There's the script to go back to the Guild-
It seems I can't think of a thing you haven't thought of...
Yes, dear. You forgot all about it.
Hello, Miss Channing.
Why not?
What a pity, all that fire and music being turned off...
I was telling Margo and Lloyd about how often you'd seen the play...
I'm so happy you're happy.
It seems to me that walking, for most people, is not very dangerous.
We're never deeply angry, we just get sore. The way you do. We know you too well...
What about Bill?
Lloyd says it's a publicity release...
That book is out of print, Karen, those days are gone. Fans no longer pull the carriage through the streets - they tear off clothes and steal wrist watches...
It's about time we did! It's about time Margo realized that what's attractive on stage need not necessarily be attractive off.
Of course she knew! For one thing, Addison told her how superbly Eve had read the part-!  Karen, let me tell you about Eve. She's got everything - a born actress. Sensitive, understanding, young, exciting, vibrant-
Margo. Margo's great. She knows it. That's the trouble. She can play Peck's Bad Boy all she wants, and who's to stop her? Who's to give her that boot in the rear she needs and deserves?
That was a pity...
Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello.
Now just a minute-
Did Miss Harrington tell you to call Mr. Richards?
Old wives' tales, born of envy and jealousy! And a phobia against truth!
That was way back...
Where is she?
Too many. And you've got a new guest. A movie star from Hollywood.
Week after week, to thousands of people, you're as young as you want...
Eve? Eve, my understudy? But I had no idea...
She was a revelation...
Not mouse, never mouse! If anything - rat!
City Hall, that's for prize fighters, and reporters - I see a cathedral, a bishop, banks of flowers...
Lloyd, I want you to be big about this... the world is full of love tonight, no woman is safe...
You know, she probably means well, after all...
I mean really, deeply angry...
We are ready with your call to Beverly Hills...
No. You're just crazy about "Liebestraum."
Look, Miss Channing... it's kind of depressing. If you don't mind my saying so, everybody's kind of dying on the vine...
I love you, Max. I really mean it. I love you. Come to the pantry.
An audition for the part we're replacing. What's-her-name, your sister...
All you got to do is name it.
I don't know if this would be a wise move...
Are you threatening me with legal action, Mr. Fabian?
Answer my question!
I didn't hear you.
--it was bullshit the way it was--
--what have you been here, nine months?--I been in this business since I was sixteen--
I met a Presidential aide once at a social occasion.
Why didn't we get that?
For the paper, no; for us, plenty.  I waited a long time and finally this big guy--I guess a bodyguard-- he left and I knocked and she remembered me, we talked awhile.
--she was panicked, Carl--every time I mentioned Watergate, you could tell.
You're not a kid anymore.
--you believe in the President, you wouldn't ever want to do anything disloyal.
And I'm a Republican.
Sure.
When?
That happens to people.  OK, go on.
We'd like to wait til we have all five before we print it.
--I know, I know--
--I haven't said anything--
Segovia begged me for me secret but I said, "No, Andres, you'll have to try and make it without me."
--'cause I only know four chords--
Could have won him a fraternity paddle with a White House seal.  God knows it worked.
--Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, Kalmbach--
What if I went up and introduced myself--think he'd slug me?
--fund that was used to gather information against the Democrats--
Night.
This?  Naw...
And you will.  But not now.
I told you, he had to go out on a case.
He is not in the car.  Sorry.
They never told me anything except my own role--I had to find out the rest in the papers.
I didn't do anything wrong.
Sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe--  --off the record.
When you guys print it in the paper, then I'll know.  I'm a lawyer, and I'll probably go to jail, and be disbarred, and what did I do that was so awful?
On the orders of Haldeman?
You're the fella who forgot he rented a Hertz car, do I have to tell you they didn't forget to send us the bill?
Absolutely--
Where are your bills, Carl?
Carl, it's a jungle.  I suggest you either pay this immediately or lay in a large supply of candles.  You'd give a stranger the shirt off your back--except it wouldn't be paid for.
There's always a later plane.
Anyplace really public, they'd know about it--they know everything at the Committee, Carl--
You don't believe me? Well, I was working the weekend of the break-in and my God, all the executives were running around like crazy--you had to practically wait in line to use the shredding machine--and when the FBI came to investigate, they never even asked me about it.
I'm relaxed--light your cigarette.
--right, right, I've got to go.  Why did you lie just then?
...No... never in so many words...
--it was all in hundreds, wasn't it?
Could buy a lot of steaks, 350,000 dollars.
Sloan knew which five, didn't he? 
It was all so crazy--the day after the break-in he gave us a speech, bouncing up and down on his heels in that loony way of his--Gordon told us not to let Jim McCord ruin everything--don't let one bad apple spoil the barrel, he said. You just know that when Gordon Liddy's calling someone a bad apple, something's wrong somewhere.  ...It's all so rotten... and getting worse... and all I care about is Hugh Sloan. His wife was going to leave him if he didn't stand up and do what was right. And he quit. He quit because he saw it and didn't want any part of it.
Do you think the truth will come out at the trial?
Routine--I'd just call John Mitchell over at the Justice Department and he'd say "go ahead, give out the money."
--he went to her apartment and he told her--
Clearly, I am here, but only as an individual, I'm not the attorney of record.  Mr. Rafferty has that position. Whatever you want, you'll have to get from him, I have nothing more to say.
I have nothing more to say.
Absolutely--Marilyn's gotten it totally wrong--
Where?  What do you mean, where?
Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground.
To where?
Ratfucking.
Total manipulation. I suppose you could say they wanted to subvert the Constitution, but they don't think along philosophical lines.
Follow every lead--every lead goes somewhere--
Yes, yes, everything. There were over fifty people employed by the White House and CREEP to ratfuck-- some of what they did is beyond belief.
I was being cautious.  You can safely say more then fifty...
--you've done worse than let Haldeman slip away, you've got people feeling sorry for him--I didn't think that was possible. A conspiracy like this-- the rope has to tighten slowly around everyone's neck. You build from the outer edges and you go step by step. If you shoot too high and miss, then everybody feels more secure. You've put the investigation back months.
...Central... Intelligence... Agency...
I think so.
I would, if you really ever wanted to know.
Preliminary hearing at Superior Courthouse?
I did all right on McCord.
Lotsa hints--
Woodward's onto a new wrinkle with the break-in thing--absolute page one stuff--
Anyone but Bernstein.
I don't get it--you were the one who wanted to fire him.
--political, personal, sexual, anything at all against Mitchell?--
--Harry, weren't you just arguing the opposite way?--
Maybe to fire you--since you two started on this story, the Post stock has dropped, what, 50 percent?  And the word is some Nixon people are challenging her TV licenses. I'm not saying she's going on relief, but I don't think it's unreasonable for her to want to meet you.
No. It was closer to seven hundred thousand.
No, none of those.
I'm not Miss Abbott.
Oh, well...  It came from the heart.
Suck me...beautiful?
...okay...
When was the last time you looked at the facilities here?
Pardon me?
I believe the kegs are upstairs.
Neither did I!
Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
Seduce her.
First of all, it's <u>Mocha</u>ccino, and secondly...Oohhhh!
Oh...well that's okay.  Cool.
I'm glad you think so.
I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies.
Yeah, well my parents wanted me to go to Northwestern.  I didn't want to write all those extra essays they make you do -- I mean, how am I supposed to know what my "most emotionally significant moment" was?  So when my U of M acceptance came in December, I said the hell with it.
Oh thank God, I thought I was the only one.
Yeah.  You know, people are always like, "What're you gonna major in?" And I don't know.  And they're like, "You'll figure it out."  Yeah?  When?
Then don't.
Sure.
You can crash at Stifler's?
Sorry, I thought you were dead.
Right.  That gives us...
Went home to shit.
No, you're stupid.  Get going!  Right now!  She's primed!
You fuckin' rule!
Okay, well that about covers it.
Is it because we have a test tomorrow? Sometimes I get cranky when I know I have a big test to study for.
Are they gross or something, like guy stuff?  Tell me.
Yeah -- hey, did you see The Little Mermaid on TV the other night?  That Ariel, whew.
Yeah, I think you sounded pretty good.
So do I, Kev.
Move with the music.
No, no, I'm not done!  I've got reserves!  Nadia, please please please.  I'm begging you.
God dammit, Stifler!
This just got a hell of a lot better.
Vicky -- do you think, maybe...it's time for us to take the next step in our relationship?
No, I don't not love you.  I like, I know that we've definitely got <u>something</u> between us.  Something good. Something special.
I know, Vick.  I'm just not ready yet, okay?
Yeah, we have something great, Vick.
No...I know the perfect time...
Wow, Kev...it's perfect.
Yeah.  Are you sure?
Okay.
What was I gonna do, call dad?  I don't even know his number.
Well, no.  I think...I guess it would be good to be able to return the favor.  I mean, it would be nice to know she enjoys things as much as I do.
How the hell do you know all these random songs?
Then where does a blowjob figure in?
Dude, prom sucks.
Attitude?  Me?  I think that <u>you</u> guys should be more enthusiastic.  Shit, we've been trying to get laid forever, and tonight's the night we've been waiting for.  We're in this together. Don't back out on me now!
He didn't?
Fuck yeah we will.
Dude, he does not.
I'd use pills. They're painless.
Uhh! Would you die already!
You try to be a good sport, and look what happens.
But you better hurry.
What a coincidence, I am someone!  Mmm. Calvin Klein's Obsession. Now it's mine too.
Ah. The mating call of the blonde. The night is young, the moon is bright, whataya feel like doing tonight?
AHHHHHHH!
Aaaaa! Jesus! This isn't happening. I'm still hallucinating. Shit!
What, all of a sudden you got a degree in supernatural law?
Yeah, that's the word. And you are?
I was an Indian, actually. Man, that damn psycho paint...! If that's supposed to be mild, I don't want to know about medium.  The planet earth. It's good to be back.
Hey, what more could I want? I survived my first and last hallucinogenic hellride, and neither of us is dead. I'd say I feel almost as great as you look.
So tell me, exactly which truck driver did you study English with?
Where did you go last night? What did you do?
I know. He told me.
A cure?
I told you. He already tried to contact me once. If you saw his face... He was desperate to tell me something. I owe him this.
I didn't know he had a wine cellar.
I... I didn't think you would... I'm sorry... I believed that son-of-a- bitch...
Yeah. French fries...
Fuck me...
"Fuck"? You think I don't know this word "fuck"? Is that how you talk to policemen in America?
It bit me! My leg! Jesus, it's down there, shoot it! Shoot it for Christ's sakes!
Shit!
Shhh! Be quiet, man! We're not alone -
Yeah? In New York we got an expression too. Goes like this...
Yeah, okay. Just gimme a minute to freshen up.
If you know about the church, why ask such stupid questions?
Sure. Don't you?
Yeah?
My God! Serafine's right. It's time to go. We'll talk soon.
Why the fuck would I do that?
It's chemistry, Andy. Nothing more. Mutated antigens concentrated in the heart of the infector unlock a vaccine- like chain reaction in the infectee. There were not many bio-chemists working in the twelfth century, but with today's technology it's possible to synthesize any chemical imaginable. When I discovered this ancient cure I knew who to go to.
Yes. I was able to decode the old texts and give Terrence the specifications. It took a lot of trial and error, but finally he got it: Adenine Di-Methyloxide. ADM. I call it ADAM. But just before he was attacked, he hid it...
You sure it's not just 'coz you jerk off too much?
How well did, er, do you know him?
Well, when you're about to pop off, what have you got to lose? Thanks for your help.
Aaaaa!!! Get the fuck away from me!
I'm telling you. It's not drugs. It's something more. Someth -
But Inspector, this girl, I wouldn't call her reliable.
He says -
Merde.
Double merde.
Right. Little twerp thinks he's Colombo.
How to read.
Get on! Anastasia, get on!
I heard it from everyone who said I didn't hear it from them!   Do you know Dmitri?
She's quite right, Dmitri, a man of my stature should not have to
Yes, your highness.
Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!
Who are you?!
You know, it's strange - Anastasia's grandmother, the Dowager Empress Tatiana has been looking for Anastasia since the revolution.  Why do you think she wouldn't go to her own grandmother?
Perhaps it's because she has amnesia too - can't remember. . .
Look - there isn't an orphan in the world who doesn't dream she's a princess but, come on. . .  Look at me!
Sorry - it's a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging.
I was all out of dynamite!
No!
You are the Princess.
Anya... where are we?
No, he just wanted to know you were happy.
I cursed then all!
She leads a charmed life, that little one ... Someone is always there to save her. In the palace as a child, on the train and now ... it's him.
Yes. And I hate that in a woman.
Pray he's color-blind...
The same thing I wanted ten years ago - all the Romonovs dead I got the others, now I have to finish up with that nuisance, Anastasia...
How much pain will you inflict on an old woman for money?!
No. Empress, you --
I should go
Despite being shot, poisoned and thrown into an icy river . . . YES!
Come on.
Okay, if that's all that we've been through together means to you, I guess it's better if we just said goodbye, once and for all! You know, it's funny, after all the serious talks and passionate moments that it ends here... in a health food restaurant on Sunset Boulevard. Goodbye, Sunny.
Who are you?
Uh ... I mean you're on right after this act.
Yes.
Why not?
It's okay.
L-L-Lyndon Johns Lyndon Johnson is a politician. You know the ethics those guys have? It's like-uh, a notch underneath child molester.
You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me.
You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.
Well, I'm sorry, I-I can't... I-I- I've gotta see a picture exactly from the start to the finish, 'cause- 'cause I'm anal.
How can you possibly oversleep?
You know what a hostile gesture that is to me?
Look, I told you it was a... mistake to ever bring a live thing in the house.
Come on, Alvy, they're only baby ones, for God's sake.
Well, no... not just, not only.
Yeah, well, I'm, but I...
Well, I do commercials, sort of...
Wisconsin.
Well, where is it? I-
Yeah.
Yeah, my grammy.
Yeah, I know.
I know, it's pretty silly, isn't it?
Sadie? Oh, well, Sadie...  Sadie met Grammy through, uh, through Grammy's brother George. Uh, George was real sweet, you know, he had that thing. What is that thing where you, uh, where you, uh, fall asleep in the middle of a sentence, you know-what is it? Uh...
Narcolepsy, right, right. Right. So, anyway, so...  George, uh, went to the union, see, to get his free turkey, be-because, uh, the union always gave George this big turkey at Christmas time because he was...  shell-shocked, you know what I mean, in the First World War.  Anyway, so, so...  George is standing in line, oh, just a sec... uh, getting his free turkey, but the thing is, he falls asleep and he never wakes up. So, so...  so, he's dead ...  he's dead. Yeah. Oh, dear. Well, terrible, huh, wouldn't you say? I mean, that's pretty unfortunate.
Oh, really? Oh, well... uh, uh, maybe, uh, maybe, we, uh...
No, I know, but... but, you know, I'm all perspired and everything.
Me? No, no, no, 'cause I never shower in a public place.
Fifteen years, yeah.
think that's, uh-
No, so help me.
you're gonna like night clubs, they're really a lotta fun.
Yeah... oh, uh, and I'm gonna have a pastrami on white bread with, uh, mayonnaise and tomatoes and lettuce.  Tsch, so, uh, your second wife left you and, uh, were you depressed about that?
No, that was the most fun I've ever had without laughing.
No, no, I-I-i, uh, I don't use any major hallucinogenics because I took a puff like five years ago at a party and
I tried to take my pants off over my head...  ...my ear.
Yeah?
M'hm.
M'hm.
Come on.  Yeah. You know what? You know, I like you, I really mean it. I really do like you.
Do I love you?
Mine.
Well, the twelve o'clock show is completely different than the nine.
Oh, I'm really, uh, looking forward to tomorrow. I mean, you know, I think that it'll be really nice to meet Mother and Father.
I didn't follow you!
What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation.
M'm.
Sinatra had gl- You never said Sinatra had glasses. So whatta you saying that I-I'm suffocating you?
There's a big black spider in the bathroom.
Yeah.
Well, I like to try to get all points of view.
Yeah?
snow shovel or anything or something.
It's for my complexion.
Hey, can yuh watch the road? Watch the --
Ah? Oh, well, your birthday's not till tomorrow, honey, I hate to tell yuh.
What thing?
Thing?
I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.
How can you say that? I mean,  who said I-I-I-I said that you, I and that girl from your acting class should sleep together in a threesome.
Yeah, I know it's sick, but it's new. You know, you didn't say it couldn't be sick.
Really? And what is the kick of it? Because I never...
It's that they don't throw their garbage away. They make it into television shows.
Yeah, she's got a great-lookin' fa- A pat on the androgynous side. But it's...
Thanks, honey.
Oh, Alvy, come on.
What's so great about New York? I mean, it's a dying city. You read "Death in Venice."
No. We're friends. I wanna remain friends.
You're mad, aren't you?
I thought just earplugs.
Oh, yeah?  Terrific.
Right. Tsch, well, I have to-I have t-o go now, Duane, because I-I'm due back on the planet earth.
Commentary.
What's fascinating is that it's physical. You know, it's one thing about intellectuals, they prove that you can be absolutely brilliant and have no idea what's going on. But on the other hand...  the body doesn't lie, as-as we now know.
Okay, okay, my analyst just thinks I'm too tense. Where's the goddamn Valium?
I can't.
Oswald and ghosts.
The only word for this is trans- plendid. It's trans-plendid.
Well, that's funny, because I happen to have Mr. McLuhan right here. So... so, here, just let me- I mean, all right. Come over here... a second.
Tell him.
Hey.
Alvy, you're a total paranoid.
Why, Max? It's a good name for you. Max, you see conspiracies in everything.
Right, Max. California, Max.
We move to sunny L.A. All of show business is out there, Max.
Sun is bad for yuh. Everything our parents said was good is bad. Sun, milk, red meat, college...
What kind of good memories, Max? Your mother and father fighting all the time.
Max, I've got a hit series.
No, no-my, you know, my stomach felt queasy all morning. I just started getting...
Yeah, she's a ten, Max, and that's great for you because you're-you're used to twos, aren't you?
Yeah. Right.
Yeah. I had the feeling that I got you at a bad moment. You know, I heard high-pitched squealing.
His wife has diabetes!
I look pretty.
Hey, listen-I mean, he was a terrific actor, and look at him, he's neat- looking and he was emotional... Y- hey, I don't think you like emotion too much.
I'll have the usual trouble with Annie in bed tonight. Whatta I need this?
I don't know. I don't know.
Yeah.
You should talk to Mr. Joe.
And how's the diva doing?
Leo?  It was out to Jude Law.  Jude passed.
Five years ago, I was at the party, remember?
I'll be fine.  Really babe.  Give me a minute.
Didn't I say?
Whatever you like.  I'm afraid it'll all be too big for you.  Are you alright, Clair?
Why would she care?
My God, your wardrobe is incredible.  It took me forever to decide.  Oh, and I found Dr. X, thank you.  You saved my life.
You think so!?  I've been working out a lot since the baby. And I've been working.  And that takes it's toll, you know.
So this sitter can always reach me.  I'm still not used to leaving him.
Well you could tell him otherwise.  It was good of you to be all this help.  But he doesn't want to go tonight.
Damn straight.
What a nose.  You missed your calling.
Ow!  Gina, you obviously need to get fucked.
Shit, I forgot to call her back.  She's off on a trip somewhere.  Oh God, my grandad's flat in London's been sold.
I should have damn well bought it.  Well, we can't afford it.  The movie's going to eat up a year of my life and I'm getting paid next to nothing.  Do you know how much Skye Davidson's getting?  Four million.
Lucy overdosed.
She left a note.
Leave us alone right now.
Forget it, Judy.
You're crazy baby.  I love you.
Let me heal you, baby.
A perfect night.
Hm.  You think we should ask them for their landscaper?
Anytime, sport.
I adore him.
We couldn't be on more solid ground.
Before I forget.  Put it on the bookshelf.
No.  I missed that.
We're great.
Well, it might be Clair.  They're threatening not to come...
No, no of course not.  How old is she? Twenty-fucking-two?
And Joe's huge in Europe.  He's like a rock star in London.  His novels sell millions.
Dinner.  Don't be angry.
Oh for fuck's sake.  Nobody uses that gate.
Well he can't have gone far.
This is a nightmare.  We should have kept him upstairs.
Love?
Sally, I have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it.  And you are out of touch with reality if you think differently.
Well there you go.  I let you off the hook.  You're one goddamn lucky actress.
Okay.  If we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made. Because I don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore.  And the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in.  That you don't have... Oh Christ, Sally.
Sally, for Christ's sake.
Don't do this.
I'll never forgive you.
Okay.
He's my favorite.
Oh, Sally Mae...
Is your script much like the novel? Jerry says it's very good.  But you know, you read the novel, and then you see the movie - and most of the time you say, "what's this?" You know?  I sometimes think we're better off not reading the novel at all.  Because, we come with expectations... and of course, we know where we're going.  Don't you find?
I don't know why Joe, we've known each other how long...
Don't be silly.
You manage to throw me off balance.  I adore you.
He's the best dog in the world.  They're both coming tonight.  Not my idea.
What?  Oh yeah, the camera man?  They gave me a list.
Not particularly.  Weird, isn't it?  God I'm rally up.  Do you feel anything yet, Mac?
Thanks, Mac.  And thanks for being so supportive about all this.  I really love you, you know.
God, I really need to jump about a bit.  How's your film going?
Oh.
I don't think so.  I feel.  I feel a bit funny.
Oh?  It's easy.  You just put one foot in front of the other... That's a good girl.
Lemon.
And he doesn't smoke?
How long have you been married?
You must have been a baby.
When I read your work I felt that you knew me.  Women must tell you that.  And this one in particular speaks to me, do you know?  I am Genna.  How many women must tell you that.  And the script is wonderful.  Wonderful and lean and visual...
You're going to be a remarkable director, a brilliant director.
Time!
You know what Sally Therrian was saying about your spine and your brain?  She didn't pull that out of thin air.  It causes brain damage.  You'd better drink a lot of water.
They're nothing like us.
There's only you, Ryan.  You know what, Ryan?  You're beautiful.  I love you so much... You need...
You need a good review and you'll be fine.  The whole color of the world will change, mark my words.
I'm going to go get my swimsuit.  I do know, Ryan, this is non addictive so you mustn't worry.  Ryan, you're a great man.
Sally?
How long ago was it?
No, no thanks.
Do Peter Sellers again.
Suicidal.  It's much less codependent.
Like your business managers?
I wasn't finished.
No.  Not something new.
Nothing's wrong.  It's great, okay? Having the time of my life.  Mac's a fantastic director.  And what can anyone say about Cal that hasn't been said.  And it's great working with friends, blah blah blah.
I guess.
Well, so glad you decided to come.
At 4:30 today he barked for a solid fifteen minutes.  I have it on tape.
Oh Soph...
Let's go in the kitchen and spy on everyone.
Not nice.  Not kind.
No, Z.  The squeaky wheel gets <u>thrown</u> <u>away</u>, alright?  You're a good ant, Z, even though you are a pain in my rear- segment.  I don't wanna see anything happen to you.  So quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble.
This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground.  Why are we even digging this thing?
That's right!  He slaughtered hundreds of termites single-handedly!
Well...  I declared war!
<u>What</u>?
I'm Princess Bala.
Quiet -- sshhh!!
Alright, alright, I'll try to get directions from one of the locals.
<u>I</u> ruined <u>your</u> life?  Look, I was perfectly happy until I met you -- alright, I was miserable, but I was <u>happily miserable</u>.
Hlllllllp!
Well...I <u>am</u> the oldest.
Superior numbers, kid!
Don't get all sappy about it!
Don't make my mistake, kid... don't...be a grunt...your whole life...
Duty calls!
Thank you, sir.
Dammit, I'm proud to be an ant.  And I know each and every one of you boys will do your duty.  Dismissed.
Of course.  The entire royal family will be there to honor you.
Engaged?  As in you're getting married?
So...you two are in love?
Negatory.  <u>Too many ants</u>.  And while we soldiers go out there, and fight, and bleed, and die for the colony, the namby-pamby workers live it up back home.
Oh, of course --
Please don't worry, your majesty. Leave the worrying to me.  As you know, I'm not an ant of half- measures.  I don't pussyfoot around. This crisis is my number one priority, and I promise you it's being dealt with swiftly, and decisively.
YES!!!  You know, people ask me, "Doctor, why are you always happy?" And I tell them it's mind over matter.  I don't <u>mind</u> that I don't <u>matter</u>!  Do you get it?  Do you get it?
I'll be back.
Are you kidding?  There were sparks between us!  This scarf is a sign!
What's gonna go wrong?!  I take your place for the royal inspection.  Bala comes strolling down the line, she sees me -- <u>bingo</u>!  Love is rekindled, and she takes me up to the palace for a little...  tea and crumpets... and you take your place again, and go march around to your heart's content!
I can't think of any.
I mean - barging in on your mother -- in the middle of the night?
One napkin, coming up.  I wish we had some champagne to wrap it around.
You may not realize it, Miss Kubelik, but I'm in the top ten -- efficiency-wise and this may be the day -- promotion-wise.
Why not? Now that they're kicking me upstairs --
Yeah.
Just tell 'em -- now and then.
It used to be serious -- at least I was -- but he wasn't -- so the whole thing is more or less kaputt.
I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.
Don't be too sure. Just because I wear a uniform -- that doesn't make me a Girl Scout.
Why?
After all, this is a conservative firm -- I don't want people to think I'm an entertainer --
The mirror -- it's broken.
Let me help you.
Someone from the office.
He doesn't give a damn about me.
Oh, I don't mind. As a matter of fact, I'm sort of flattered -- that anybody should think a girl like you -- would do a thing like this -- over a guy like me.
That's right. Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
You don't have to entertain me.
Gin.
Oh. I can type up a storm, but I can't spell. So they gave me a pair of white gloves and stuck me in an elevator -- that's how I met Jeff --  Oh, God, I'm so fouled up. What am I going to do now?
Was he really upset when you told him?
Maybe he does love me -- only he doesn't have the nerve to tell his wife.
I'm going to write a letter to Mrs. Sheldrake.
You bet. I got a terrific hand.
I just want some fresh air.
Why can't I ever fall in love with somebody nice like you?
Over a girl?
No, I don't.
So let 'em. Look, I'm going to cook dinner for us. We'll have the fruit cake for dessert. You just sit there and rest. You've done enough for one day.
You ought to see my backhand.  And wait till I serve the meatballs. 
Cheers.
What?
I don't?
Nothing's changed. You know, we never finished that gin game --
What you get from renting to bachelors. All night I didn't sleep ten minutes -- and I'm sure you woke up Dr. Dreyfuss.
Well, you know how it is -- things pile up.
What kind of joint are you running?
Are you going to deny it?
You mean -- you and me? I thought you were taking the branch manager from Kansas City --
Well, that's very kind of you -- only I'm not feeling well -- you see, I have this cold -- and I thought I'd go straight home.
Oh?  Oh!
That's good thinking, Baxter. Next month there's going to be a shift in personnel around here -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're executive material.
Relax, Baxter.
Oh, no sir. Certainly not. Anyway, it's none of my business -- four apples, five apples -- what's the difference -- percentage-wise?
Roger. And I'll get that other key.
I didn't want to tell you over the phone but that certain party -- you know who I mean -- I found her here last night -- she had taken an overdose of sleeping pills.
Good. Is there anything you need -- money -- ?
That's right.  I've moved out of my house -- I'm going to be staying in town, at the Athletic Club.
I got kicked in the head, too.
You know that other key to your apartment -- well, when we had that little scare about Miss Kubelik, I thought I'd better get rid of it quick -- so I threw it out the window of the commuter train.
I know, Buddy-boy, I know.  But those things don't always run on schedule -- like a Greyhound bus.
I know.  Mr. Eichelberger -- in the Mortgage Loan Department -- last night he had a little Halloween party here --
Could be she's just a nice, respectable girl -- there are millions of them.
I'm sorry, Mr. Dobisch.  You know I like to help you guys out -- but it's sort of late -- so why don't we make it some other time?
Of course not.  But -- how can I be efficient in the office if I don't get enough sleep at night?
I'm all out of liquor -- and there's no clean glasses -- no cheese crackers -- no nothing.
Yes, Mr. Dobisch.
Listen, Baxter, we made you and we can break you.
Wednesday -- Wednesday --  I got somebody penciled in -- let me see what I can do -- I'll get back to you.
Yeah.  Well -- see you, Doc. 
Me?
Let me get my bag.
I don't know -- I mean -- I wasn't here -- you see -- we had some words earlier -- nothing serious, really -- what you might call a lovers' quarrel --
Something like that.
A mansch -- a human being! So you got off easy this time -- so you were lucky --
Yeah -- I'm giving up the apartment.
Happy New Year.
You know, that big-shot down in Cuba with the crazy beard.
Because as far as I'm concerned, he's a no good fink. Two weeks ago I wrote him a letter -- never even answered me.
Why not? We don't owe Buddy-boy anything.
Get more coffee.
Mr. Baxter -- nineteenth floor.
Because I took some sleeping pills. But I'm all right now -- so let's go.
And before me there was Miss Rossi in Auditing -- and after me there was Miss Koch in Disability -- and just before you there was Miss What's-Her-Name, on the twenty- fifth floor --
-- same sauce -- sweet and sour.
Do I. That leaky little boat you rented -- and me in a black negligee and a life preserver --
We talked about a lot of things.
Okay. I'm sorry.
I promise.
It's Christmas Eve, Fran -- let's not fight.
You run along -- I want to fix my face.
Atlantic City?
Baxter?
He wouldn't.
Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.
See if they'll what?
Yeah --
Captain Willard -- go ahead.
Well --
I'm not that fond of blondes -- maybe I like brunettes --
We have a lot of pride in our unit --
I know, I know, it's all right. Come in this way. It's mined over there. This way. It's all right.
We do.
A long time.
He was working A.R.V.N. patrols and had one a them little cocky gook asshole Lieutenants -- anyhow, the Lieutenant took his new Playboy one day, sat on the end of the dock, and wouldn't give it back.
Yes, sir --
Call me what, sir?
That's right, sir -- I come from New Orleans -- I was raised to be a sauciere.. a great sauciere. We specialize in sauces; my whole family. It's what we do. I was supposed to go to Paris and study at the Escoffier School; I was saving the money. They called me for my physical so I figured the Navy had better food.
I know.
Not a thing.
Thirty meters up, Lance; I saw the fucking flash.
Let's go.
I am -- I'm Captain B.L. Willard. This is Chief Warrant Officer Phillips -- it's his boat. We were shot up bad downriver and need repairs and food -- we can pay you in gold.
Thta's not Charlie's work --
If they have boats ... or canoes... they'd get lost in the fog. We can't move either -- we'll end up on the shore.
Would he remember you ?
You can see, of course, the implications, if any of this -- even rumours leaked out.
We ain't goin' down the river.
He's commanding the detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
You'll get blown outta here some day.
What about an American named Kurtz?
That's right, sir.
Boss left.
It's really long left slide, breaks on the short side of the point -- catches a south swell.
Affirmative, Big Duke Six -- We're even got some rockets left.
I got bored in Saigon.
No. Walked.
Hairy ?
Yeah.
Oh Captain, that is so true.
Fuck no.
I'm taking you back. You can still live.
His death was -- yes, he died as he lived.
He can't kill us.  We're on his side.
Yeah... thanks.
Which one's the Colonel's?
He didn't look like he'd take that sitting down.
No -- I don't think so. But it'll be back. They were circling. It'll be back.
What is this bridge?
Kurtz.  I know you've heard of him.
I know.
The river is beautiful.
You may think what you wish, Captain, but I like you very much.
Big show in the parade grounds this noon -- some boss stuff --
23   CONTINUED:  
134  CONTINUED:  
How?  Nobody this far north monitors that frequency until avalanche season.  Besides, I'm surprised a tough guy like you uses fancy electronics.
I was making my rounds, saw your hangar wide open, plane getting rained on, so I closed it up.
Had some good years.  Met her in '66.  She showed up one day in Coldfoot.  No one knew her.  One Sunday morning, she marched into a bar and announced she was available as a wife to the highest bidder.  Didn't work out in three months, she'd return the money and leave, no hard feelings.  My bid was eight thousand dollars.  Beautiful girl.
That's why I left, moved to Washington.  When I met Eric I was doing day shoots -- products and fashion, mostly.  Pretty dull.  Eric was teaching college, and then he got the job with Northland Oil.  We wanted to stay together, so we talked them into funding some wilderness photography... and here I am.
Sam?  We haven't seen him.
Be careful -- there're two of them.
Bastards took off, though, didn't they?
Eric, leave it alone.  It's not your business.
Sure did.  He was one of the trappers we rousted from the Haul Road.
He was sitting in a hot tub with a hooker.
You make it sound like a prison sentence.
-- Permanently?
Prolonged darkness makes people crazy.
I'm staying.
Ecology.  Folks use that term for everything but what it means: who's eating who.
I needed a pilot's license to take the job here, so I got one in six weeks.
I don't plan on dying.
-- Turn around.
I've been on ice like this when I was a kid, skating.  Spread your weight, keep moving.  Go on.
I'm right behind you.
It could blow over tomorrow, too.
You know Meyerling?
You got a knack for seeing things the way you want to see them.
I liked you better frozen.  You didn't talk so much.
Lets us watch each other's backs over a wide area.  Only thing messed me up this time was getting arrested in the baths. ELT was in my duffel bag, not around my neck where it should've been.
You kill me, you sign your death warrant.  And hers.
Wound's a through-and-through. Missed my liver, I think.
You left a footprint at the Sportsmen's camp.  Only pretty sight there, Ben, 'cause the two men you didn't shoot and mutilate died of exposure.
I got it from here.  Thanks.
If that was all, fine.  But carving him up, stranding the others, that's too fucking much. Is everything that walks, crawls, flies or swims fair game to you?
I don't want to hurt you, Sam.
Have you heard anything from the girl staying with me, Anne Marie?
Back at my place... he, uh, broke his leg.
-- I'm putting him on the plane to Fairbanks, eleven tomorrow.
What are you talking about?
There'll be three, four men at the most.  I have some backup, nothing will happen.
What does this matter to you?
I should release Corbett because you want some votes?
Fuck you.
I just as soon he stay gone. Fool could've got us all killed, arresting Ben Corbett here in town.
Goddamn!  Viking Bob!  Mitchell's inside, boring bastard...
Get the fuck out of here.
What you gonna do with it?  Large bore's for shit on small game.
Quit fucking around.  Get in.
Closest planes for hire are here in Cache.
Sit your suspect out in the cold. He'll keep.
Huh?
I'm on the last page. How do you spell conscience?
I want us to go out.
Stop treating this like I'm going away with a man. He's just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me. I hate this, Mom -- I hate this. He's a freak show -- the worst person I ever met.
Don't be silly. How bad?
Uh-huh.
He's in the bathroom...  He's fine.
Since forever.
No. I asked. They said it's not covered under my plan. And it's not necessary anyway.
They're considerable. But Mr. Udall wants to be billed.
I've got Jews at my table.
You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?
Okay.
No.
It's okay -- I'll sit here.
What are you doing here?
Are you totally gone? This is my private home...
How do you know about my mother?
Carol the waitress?
I was working...  can't you just drop me a thank-you note?
I'm not going to sleep with you. I will never, ever sleep with you. Never. Not ever.
Yes. I'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to Baltimore.
I want you to go on this trip.
Bettes tells me he's doing fine.
What's that got to do with it?
Oh.  We might. Yes. We can. Let's.
Welcome.
That wasn't payment. When you first came into breakfast, when I saw you -- I thought you were handsome... Then, of course, you spoke... So now that your soft li'l underbelly is all exposed. Tell me, why did you bring me?
I can trust my brain.
See. There's an example. I don't know whether you're being cute or crazy now.
Go ahead.
... 'Cause of being woken up, and it would make my job impossible. So then I wouldn't even try.
See. It's four in the morning. A walk sounds a little screwy to me, if you don't mind.
I'm sorry... I can't hear you. I can't turn my head all the way yet... tell her we can't hear her.
No, let me pull over so I can pay full attention.
No... Nervous. It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren't along.
Can you believe in our little mix you're the good roommate.
All right, cut me a break.
You think you're kidding.
Don't want to. I love you.
What are you trying to do to me?
Hey, elephant girl, call her or something...  just let her do my one meal here. I'll pay whatever. I'll wait.  Do it!!!
Won't worry about it. You go ahead.
No, I promise...  not a chance. I own this guy. There was no one else. I'm on the move too much. Trust me.
Well, I can't reach them.
How come you're pretending to do cop work -- 'cause I don't think you could find your ass if you were spotted the hole.
I got it. You're talking about your dog. I thought that was the name of the colored man I've been seeing in the hall.
Well, that's a load off.
It smells like shit in here?
Where are all your queer party friends?
Come on, sweetheart...
Got any easier questions?
But sick -- nauseous -- where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches -- when you can barely get up the will to complain.
Let's do the small talk in the car. Load up.
I'm going back with you.
It was better than this... Look, you, I'm very intelligent. If you're going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope, you got to be better than you're doing. If you can't be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up. I'm drowning and you're describing water.
Well, if that's true then I'm really in trouble.
Okay. Thanks a lot. Here I go.
No. No. No. Hey, that painting in there...  I just want to tell you...
No.  No problem.  The airport, right?
Where?
Look, I'm real tired and I'm not interested in fucking chit-chat.
What?  You think I'm running you up?
Oh, yeah.
Bain!
You're too late.
I don't give a fuck what you are.  I asked you --
I'm sorry, sir.  A year ago there was a fire in the old Hotel Paraiso. This is the new Hotel Paraiso.
Know what?
Freelancer.  A woman.  Surveillance specialist.
I bet you fucking know!
He stole another contract.
Where are we going?
Who the fuck are you?  Who do you work for?
Until a minute ago.
No.  They hired Bain.  The contract would have been mine, but Bain took it from me as he took the previous one.
Yes.
We don't have a choice.
It's simple.  You need me.  I need you.  And we will both need money.
Just Electra?
This is crazy.  I can't trust you. You can't trust me.  How can we possibly help each other?
It's not the same, is it?
He was Russian.  Nicholai Tachlinkov.  A legend in the business when I was just starting. I admired him.  When I heard he loved chess I became obsessed with the game.
Why?
How did you get into the business?
The C.I.A.?
Jesus -- why?
But you knew what they were training you for?
After that?
You said you didn't trust it.
Several.
What?
Why not?
You can have the bed.  The chair is fine for me.
Yes.
Sorry.
Fine.
Aiiee.  More waiting?  I don't know if I like this plan.
You'll have the money.  How do I know that you won't --
Except --
Except, if he doesn't come out of the hotel.
You killed him here?  In this city, outside that bank?
I don't know.  It just happened.  I was here ten years ago, I'm here now.  That's it.
It wasn't planned or premeditated. I swear.  Things happened beyond my control.  I understood; I saw where they were leading and I suppose that it just made sense.
Yes.
He wanted what I want now; to get out of the business.  To disappear to some empty Greek island.
No.
Did he explain how this happened?
Why?
Are you attracted to me?
Yes.
Martin.
Shit.
Yes.
Oh, God.  I see it!
God damnit, Electra.  This is not a game.  This is business.
Electra --
Yes.  Please come in.
Yes.
Sure.
It's possible.
I thought that I would be thinking about Margaret, or work, or that I'd be having these deep, profound and depressing thoughts but I'm not.  I'm trying to think really profound thoughts, but I can't. It seems very funny to me.
I used to think about it.  I had Margaret.  She wanted kids.  I thought about moving somewhere far away like, Europe.  I could see all of that, the first part, the getting away but I couldn't see that next part.  'Then what?' So I'd stop thinking about it and go back to work.  You understand?
No.
I'm sorry, but I am waiting for an associate.  Can you hold everything for me until he arrives?
What's that? A Democrat with an attitude!
Yeah, but it's not just that. To the Czech mind, any movement, whether political or literary should be underground. If it isn't, then it's not radical and not worthy of a look-in.
We're only joking.....It is your round though!
Yeah, let's check out the low-life.
Care to elaborate?
Amazing, he didn't even say "if".
Great. Let's say nine o'clock here tomorrow. Catch you later partner.
A locksmith too? Why d'you ever bother with writing?
Thought of everything haven't you.
I'll try not to, I'll leave that to you. Anyway, there's still plenty more of it.
No....The Asylum!
Yes, but it suddenly clicked, this is going to be a crazy place and, since the Commies are used to seeking asylum, we can use that in the marketing.
Have you ever stolen anything?
No, for the Asylum.
Not yet, we need a few lengths of scaffold.
Am I late?
Who put a bee up your butt?
You should have said it was Bring-A-Bottle.
We could make a start on the floor afterwards.
I can't, I've got to split. I have to take a class at two o'clock.
I fell in love.
You capitalist pig!
Hey Jahn.....You got a name for this thing?
I had a visit from the British Embassy. They think I'm a stray soccer hooligan.
He got that one right.
WE gotta think of something.
Suppose those contained all the file info too? You could have a third or so of it there.
Siberia.
You're in the clear, keep it that way, I'll be okay.
Sure....Anything else I can do for you?
We ain't going to give it away this time, are we?
Have you met Holly? Josh's friend.
Really?
You used to read.
Okay, whatever. Come on Chris!
Everybody is at home, it's no good.
It's bad news when you can't even bribe kids.
No way Doug, I can't.
Yep, it's all yours.
Cool....So, if we say eight o'clock.
Yeah, great....Dobchay! It will dry, yes?
Ah, so what?
A month, Jesus! And how do I know you're not crapping me?
No, it should be over soon.
I know, some are trapped, usually by money.
Alright!
Oh shit, yeah. Can you lend some more money?
It's Josh's.
That's right.
No!
Thanks, but I don't intend to stay.
I lied to you, I didn't destroy the floppy disks.
I didn't get to see what's on the disks but I can guess. Do you want to hear my terms or not.
First, I want to walk free with a letter, in English, from the Prosecutor General dropping all charges. Second, I want two first class tickets to London leaving tonight and three thousand crowns in a stamped envelope. Lastly, all actions against the students are to be stopped!
You may use my office.
Good, wait here, it will not take long and then you may go.
Maybe it is!
Oh that's it? Everything I do is crap!
Yes, if you can get him free.
The building has been occupied and the locks have been changed.
I don't want his money.
-- I like the car I have.
We talked. He wanted to get a bite -- after. I said no.
No. I won't be long.
I could do it if I tried. Even Kelly thinks so.
I didn't know either.
Be yourself and I don't think there is a wrong thing.  Let Jamie take the lead. She'll let you know what she needs.
Landon, honey. There's nothing more.
I need to whizz.
York Ave.
It was.
-- Obviously.
Your book and your brown sweater and your hair. What's more to know -- ?
I don't want to have any conversation.
'They won't.'
-- I know you don't suck at acting.
Like me.
It's private.
I do know.  Be two places at once... learn to hit a baseball or turn a cartwheel... eat breakfast with chopsticks...
He's a softy. Got him wrapped around my finger.
Know so.
Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.
That is my telescope.
I know there's a plan for everyone, but sometimes I don't understand what the message is -- or what the point is.
Interpreted by another guy like my father.
I'm really glad you think so.
It's not.
You don't know what you want --
And why would that scare me?
Yeah, with a finish in about a decade.
I heard what you did. Thank you.
Why not?
We're going somewhere. After. And no. I didn't ask your father.
Uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.
Wonder. Beauty. Joy.  Love.
Not possible.
Twice a year.
The Challenger exploded. Principal Kelly's about to make an announcement.
Mars.
You planned this --
No.
I don't want you to see him outside school activities.
Up to?
Let's get something straight. You don't know me. I don't know you. But I know what you're about.  Keep your distance from this house -- and from Jamie.
Your parents are divorced?
I'm not tired.
Yes. You?
Thank you.
What do you want, Biff?
Yes, sir!
Oh, I'm feeling much better now.
Marty, you haven't been listening. Nobody's asked me to the dance...yet.
You mean like how you're supposed to act with someone on a first date?
No!
Bic... It's a Bic pen.
I'm going to be at the dance.
Why is she gonna get angry with you?
All I can say is, that's one helluva attitude, Mr. McFly. 'Let's explode a hundred megaton Geothermal nuclear device, just to see it.'
You're the only Mr. Lewis in this class.  If you have something to say, say it so the whole class can hear.
Five cents, please.
Home, school, here... 
Pro! Release the rope!
Nope. The way I figure it, doors are made to be opened. See you after school.
AM or PM?
Is Shemp all right?
The future, Marty, the future is everything! I built this machine to see the future. So I am going to send Shemp twenty-four hours into the future. You can assist me, if you like.
Ssshhhhh!
Must have been? Used to live? I do live here.
You didn't, Professor. It was an accident! You see, what happened --
Just a guess. I figured kids would still be drinking Coke in 1982.
We don't....
That's just great!
You were ringing the doorbell!
What if you lost your keys?
I brought it with me from 1982. It's from my science book.
Are you trying to tell me that my mother's got the hots for me?
Jesus!
It'll be fine, Marty.  You'll be fine. Good luck. He stuck his hand out and Marty shook it. But there was still a question that was nagging at him...
Perfect...
Nope. My father's never clenched a fist in his entire life!
Professor Brown grinned. I guess I'll see you in... about 30 years.
Sure,.
No way!
Hell no! The way my mom carries on about sex -- you even mention the word and she goes into cardiac arrest. You shoulda seen her face when I told her we were gonna stay up all night Saturday, he added. Always afraid something is going to happen.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah.
I used to throw trash for the City.
I can't think of anything at the moment... I'd like you to write me out a slip, though, proving I came down here.
Long as my ammo held out... Right there's where you caught me.
Mmmmm.
I don't know. Always wanted to be a criminal, I guess. Just not this big a one... Takes all kinds though.
Tom...
Thanks.
What'd you come out here for?
Well, it's not good enough.  Just what do you think would happen to her if she stuck around with you, Kit? Guy like you.
You love him?
Holly.
Spanish.
I know.
Okay.
It's your play.
I don't care.
But it would hurt.
We better call the doctor... Listen. I'll say how it happened, part I saw.
You said that once already... Too late now.
Just to keep him out of the sun.
Soon as I start the car... and fix my hat.
It was going too fast.
I just don't want to go.
Stay as long as you like.
Listen, ah... We're going to take the Cadillac for a while. How'd that be?
Yes.
Just gimme a chance.
I'm a giant semi-conductor, and there's alien creatures all around us. Form the Eighth Dimension, I think.  Look...
It's your hand, Buckaroo.
Arachtoids.  From Planet Ten.
And try the President's private number at the hospital.  Make sure this is on the level. We're busy people here.
Sure do pack a mean wallop...let's go...
It?  Who does?
What is it, Tommy?
New Jersey brought her back to the bus through heavy fire.  Quite a guy if you want my opinion.
Now, Buckaroo Banzai?
Stole his body?  When Doctor Lizardo's hair turned red and his mind snapped?  Of course!  What else?
To get my guns.
Who were you really trying to kill last night?
Who?
The Netherlands.  Whew, that's a long way from Wyoming.
I'll shoot yours off if I had a gun, you double-dealing Casanova!  I thought you liked me for myself.  But why should you, huh?  A jerk like me.
She was killed, Penny.
It's too dangerous.
Penny--?!  Are you all right?
Hello, Mr. President.  How's my favorite patient?  Any tenderness?
Hell they don't. I met my first wife that way.
Whadda you need Buckaroo for?
Bet you say that to all the girls, Perfect Tommy.
She's just a damn road hugger, Allison.  Plus the man can drive.
Yes I am. I'm working on a wres – please call me Barton.
Please, Barton.
Really?...
If I can. He gets jealous; he-
Audrey, thank you for coming. Thank you.  I'm sorry to be such a... such a... Thank you.
What are they like? What are they about?
You wrote his scripts for him?
I want to know how many of Bill's books you wrote!
That doesn't help anything, Bill.
Bill –
...Who?
Garland, it's me.
W.P. Mayhew? The writer?
Well... actually, no Bill...
Mmm. Wal, me, I just enjoy maikn' things up. Yessir. Escape... It's when I can't write, can't escape m'self, that I want to tear m'head off and run screamin' down the street with m'balls in a fruitpickers pail. Mm...
I'm buildin' a levee. Gulp by gulp, brick by brick. Raisin' up a levee to keep that ragin' river of manure from lappin' at m'door.
I said drown 'em all! Who is that?
I need help, Audrey.
But... I thought no one cared about this picture.
Are you deaf, he LIKES you! He's taken an interest! What the hell did you say to him?
I'm not sure anymore. I guess I try to make a difference.
Yeah, I'm fine, Garland – I have to talk to you. I'm calling long distance.
It's about what I'm writing, Garland. It's really... I think it's really big.
Very important, Garland. I just thought you should know that. Whatever happens.
Have you read the Bible, Garland?
That's all right, really, thank you.
Okay... a quick one, sure...
No, I'm actually writing for the pictures now –
Yeah, I guess it is. But in a way, that's exactly the point. There's a few people in New York – hopefully our numbers are growing – who feel we have an opportunity now to forge something real out of everyday experience, create a theater for the masses that's based on a few simple truths – not on some shopworn abstractions about drama that doesn't hold true today, if they ever did...
I can see you feel pretty strongly about it.
And I could tell you some stories –
Yeah, come in Charlie. Hadn't really gotten started yet – what happened to your ear?
No, I guess you're stuck with the one you've got. Have a seat.
You know, in a way, I envy you Charlie.  Your daily routine – you know what's expected. You know the drill. My job is to plumb the depths, so to speak, dredge something up from inside, something honest. There's no road map for that territory...
Not at all. It's damned interesting.
Yeah, as a matter of fact they did. Come on in.
Charlie, I'm in trouble. You've gotta help me.
Yeah.
She's dead, Barton! If that was her name.
Have to, old timer. Just for a while.
Everything's okay, believe me. I know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.
I hear it's Mundt. Madman Mundt.
Because you DON'T LISTEN!
Thanks, but I wanted a place that was less...
Great! He's poor, this wrestler! He's had to struggle!
CAN you?  You damn well better be. Jesus, if I hadn't been honest in my business dealings – well, of course, you can't always be honest, not with the sharks swimming around this town – but if you're a writer, you don't think about those things – if I'd been totally honest, I wouldn't be within a mile of this pool – unless I was cleaning it. But that's no reason for you not to be. Honest, I mean.  Not cleaning the pool.
KISS THIS MAN'S FEET!!
You don't have to cover for him. It's noble of you, but these things happen in business.
Congratulations.
That's right, Fink, he lives next door to you.
You're a sick fuck, Fink.
What do you do, Fink?
Couple of days ago we see the same M.O. out in Los Feliz.
Physician, heal thyself.
Give you nose bleeds?
...Fred...
She was there, wasn't she?
I'm fine.  Come on, Beth!  You know I'm fine!  How the hell long do I have to keep doing this?
No.
Who?
She said what you said she'd say.
I thought you quit.
Who's got access to my goddamn file?
She knows stuff about me that only you know.
What was she like in school?
I don't need any help.
Put your hands up!
I got a message on my machine to meet Gus here.  Where is he?
Yes.
No.  We had a drink at the club. We left together.  I came here. He went home.
No.  I wasn't in the mood to have sex with anyone last night.
I quit.
I have nothing to hide.
No.
Thanks.
I don't know.  But you do.
There's a name from the past.
No.
Yes, you did.  They never tested you, did they?  But Internal Affairs knew.
Please.
To see if he can get away with it.
Fine.  How's your back?
Do you want personal insights and adolescent secrets?  I don't do those.
I told you I had a vivid imagination.
No, she didn't... she never got jealous before... she got excited.  I don't have luck with women. There was this girl I met while I was in college.  I slept with her once.  She started following me around, taking my picture.  She dyed her hair, copied my clothes. Lisa something... Oberman.  It was awful.
I never have before.
Try me.
You paid $50,000 for your character?
Of course I knew.
No.
I decided to give you one more chance.  I missed you.
What are you researching?
Somebody always does.
What are you going to do?  Charge me with smoking?
No.
He was murdered.
Why would I need an attorney?
Do you use drugs, Ms. Tramell?
What was the weapon?
Do you remember his name?
What are you doing here, Pop?
I don't son, but I got the minority opinion.
Well, hell, son, it's got a certain ring to it, I'll say that.
I went over last night, too.
I don't believe it.
Which one you talkin' about now, son?  We know ole Hazel did it; we know young Roxy did it -- and the other one Well, hell, she's got that magna come lawdy pussy on her that done fried up your brain.
I'm going with you.
Yeah.  I know.
Go stick your head in a tub of ice water.  See where she leads.
Is he dead?
Do you want me to work the case, Phil, or do you want me to --
Formerly engaged to Roberto Vasquez, deceased --
You forgot her degree in literature. She's a writer.  She published a novel last year under a pen name. Do you want to know what it's about?
She didn't ask me for the ride. She asked anybody.
Fuck you, too Nick.
I don't think she meant to go off the hill, do you?
She was the last person seen with the guy -- I'll take the responsibility.
You wouldn't be here otherwise, would you?
Can you check again?
He was shot.
It's in New Jersey.
I think it's in New Jersey.
Gee. I don't need to. You're a natural. You should sign up with my modeling agent.
I wanted to make a few more of these. Frank's been drinking this Mexican beer. It makes a good green.
I don't like beer.
I didn't see you.
I need a dealer.
Decipher?
You mean like an ape?
What?
Should there be?
Very well.
What's wrong with you today?
SAMO.
Thanks.  Your dad called again – something about a job.
Who's John Henry?
He's the best painter in the world. I'm gonna give him one of these.
What's your fuckin' problem, anyway?
'Uppity?' Like as in 'uppity nigger?'
I guess you did.
Just come to the Mudd Club on Friday.
You're blaming me? I had to go see my family.
Staten Island would be ok.
Think so?
You mean babies with you?
Hi.
That's great.
Hi.
Wanna Mac?
Life doesn't... make... sense. This city's k-killing me. I want my liquid hijack Marlboros!
No, I don't. I'm alone. We all are. Especially here. The world's unjust. The respect fools get. The disrespect I get.
I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
Thanks again for not inviting me. I'm only here on business.
I'm here for an interrogation. You've been called a graffiti artist and I wanna know why. All I see are scribble scrabble abstractions!
You're selling and ending the culture. Not one bit of information. Only to get the money and growl with the power, man.
I will relay the message.
You'll never guess.
"Shreck's."  You --
I'm -- sorry, I --
I tried to grab you -- save you --
You mean mistook <u>me</u>?
Treat to be here.
No darker than yours, Bruce.
Yeah?  Me too...
If I said yes, then you might think me a Norman Bates, or a Ted Bundy type ... and then you might not let me kiss you.
Ah ... then you've come to the right lonely mansion.
Nor I, on the second.
Y'mean take off our costumes?
But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean ... it.
I don't know.  Till we figure it out, let's ... let's keep dancing.
Damn those Carny bolsheviks the other night, throwing bricks at my windows --
Wayne, I'll not stand for mud- slinging in this office.  If my assistant were here, she'd already have escorted you out, to --
He <u>is</u> Batman, you moron.
One way to find out?
Down, Oswald.  We have to talk.  You see we've got something in common.
I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
Did I?  Only 'cause my mom trained me to, with a man... any man, all men --  Corn dog!
PMS.
Women... nothing surprises me, Chip. Excepting your late mother... Who even knew Selina had a brain to damage?  Bottom line:  she tries to blackmail us, we drop her out a higher window.  Meanwhile I got badder fish to fry.  Yeah -- Oswald, please.
Silent night, violent night...
My god ... it's true.  The Penguin- Man of the sewers ... Please, don't h--
And exactly <u>why</u> am <u>I</u> gonna help <u>you</u>?
You won't regret this, Mr. Shreck.
We need signatures.  To overturn the ballot.  I can supply those, Oswald.
That's fine, Oswald.  But to get the Mayor recalled, we still need a catalyst, a trigger, an incident. Like the Reichstag fire, the Gulf of Tonkin.
I think you'd feel out of place at my party.  You see, it's for winners.
Well I figured that your password was "Finster."  Your Pomeranian. And it was.  And it's all very interesting, though a bit on the technical side, I mean about how the power plant is a power plant in name only since in fact it's gonna be one big giant...
I'm no cat.  I'm just an assistant. A <u>secretary</u> --
Too good?
I must protect my interests, Ms. Kyle.  And Interest Number One, is <u>moi</u>.
Actually, it's a lot like that.
Uncle Alfred left for America.  Much to my mother's dismay -
Oh no, those things frighten me.
Perhaps the truth is you don't really trust anyone.
Don't be silly, Alfred. After all, she's family.
No, my boy.  I'm afraid none of us can.
Attending to heroes?  No sir.  My Only regret is that I was never able to be out there with you.
What seems to be the problem?
Specify, please.
Pheromones?
Rather disappointed at how poorly I taught you proper housekeeping.  And quite well, it seems.  Thanks to you, son.  Thanks to you all.
Hey, I'm the one who kicked Ivy's botanical butt.  Personally.  Me.  I did.
I'm afraid to ask.
Nightwing.  Scourge of darkest evil.
Mr. Freeze.
I know.  The feeling just vanished.
Just the beast.
What are you talking about?
Kill her later.  We've got work to do.
I see you knew him.
Your intentions are noble, but no diesel fuel for heat.  No coolants to preserve food.  Millions would die of cold and hunger alone.
What?
Well...um...her.
Somehow he survived.  But the cryoslution mutated his body.
Presumed dead.  No one knows.
Whoa, I made a mistake.  I'm sorry. Don't go all protective on me.  It won't happen again.
Her name is Pamela Isley.  I saw her talking to Gordon.  She must have stolen his keys, altered the signal-
You once said to me that being part of a team means trusting your partner.  That sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.  DO you remember?
Well, I, my most unabominable snowman, have been impressed by you. In fact I propose a pairing.  So I'm here to set you free.
I wonder if I can get a cell with a view of the gardens?
You leave Batman and Robin to me.
The way to a boy's heart is through his ego.  What strapping young hero could resist his very own...signal?
What exactly are you working on in there?  What are those screams?
Well, I can respect your opinion.
I think they're getting worse.
Ninety-three, including the sauna.
Is he all right?
He boosted the Jag?  Is that all?
Dr. Meridian...
Perhaps. Perhaps not. Why not ask the lady?
As well as can be expected, I guess. Give me the bad news.
But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean?
Mystery.
How come this is the only locked door around this museum? What's back there?
And you are?
I didn't know that. See? You _are_ interesting. And call me Chase. By the way, do you have a first name? Or do I just call you bats?
Try a fireman. Less to take off.
We could give it a try. I'll bring the wine, you bring the scarred psyche.
For _me_? Really? Tell me.
That's usually my line.
Would you? I'm not so sure.
Rage. Anger. Passion. Pain.
Okay, tiger, take it slow. You going to give me your pin or something?
What?
...I missed Two-Face by a heartbeat. When we catch him, you gotta let me kill him!
And when you finally get Two-Face?
How could I forget?
Paranoid? The psychotic?
A man with a death wish.
Haven't you had enough? Don't Think And Drive.
You're a genius.
Oh yes, and certainly _WE_ will!
Actually, I wanted to talk to Batman. Pass that on to Mr. Wayne, would you?
... Murderer...
Look, I appreciate what you did for me. But this is my job. And I'm keeping those pictures.
That's why I wear a target on my chest.
I loathe bats.
Neither had I.  Odd desire for a woman, I guess.
I'll take you home if you'd like.
Well, Bruce -- I don't think -- that would be possible.
I feel naked without it.
What now?
I suggest a nice big bomb.
Take 'em! I want his head!
What are you talking about?
Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and walked off a roof, all right?  No big loss.
Nobody wants a war, Carmine.  If we can't do business, we shake hands and part friends.
That's it.
Ten million dollars. Ten mi -- YOU CHEAPSKATES! I've just wiped out the stock market. I've cost you billions!  I want ten million and one.
Goddammit, I expect to be treated like and ARTIST. GET OFF MY SCREEN!!
Strong stomach, huh?  I like that in a woman -- Maybe we can do business after all.
Alicia!  Come here, have a seat.  Show Miss Vale why you wear the mask.
Bruce Wayne?  Date?  He called you up and asked you for a date?  Shit.  HEY, MIRANDA!  C'MERE!  Now pay close attention to this.  Miranda -- tell my friend here what you told me about Bruce Wayne.
Why?  Aw, come on, Vicki, I'm a reporter. I'm curious.  I do this for a living.  There's a phone.  You can call him up and cancel.
... Oh?  Why is that, Vicki?
He's not crazy.
Yeah. Deja vu.
I said I'd check with you.
Did you really ask?
One.
Your face smells like a foot.
Great.  You said you'd ask Grierson about putting our guest somewhere else.  Did you?
I'm afraid you don't know the half of it. Sit down.  I have a tale to tell.  And not a happy one.
Night.
Ahm.....
She's ... well, she's good.
Not necessarily.  That's where this ...  comes in.  No, I've had a better idea than sacking people.  You'll hear soon enough.
Great news.
Sack him?  David, what else can I do?  This business is not, repeat, not breaking even. And David ... notice anything this morning?
... you have to sack me.  I understand, sir.  I'll go quietly.  In fact I'll go right now.
I'm fired?  Because I let a... copy of a painting the get stolen?
There's a man.  I woke up next to a man ...
It's a kind of an interesting swap. Mom for the Man from Ga Ga.
Sting?!  Sounds like something you put on a rash.
Yeah, heh heh. Let's just wheel this thing back to the house.
Shut up Beavis! Uh, yeah. We'll do your wife.
Yeah, heh heh, and then we're gonna get a big-screen TV! Heh heh.
Uh... Buuuuut. Boot. Someone named boot.
Uh... Uh...
Huh huh. No way, dude.
Heh heh. Thank God.
Yeah, heh heh. Damn right!
That sucks. Heh heh. They need some shows about fire! Change the channel.
Yeah, it's just the same thing over and over again.
This desert is stupid. They need to put a drinking fountain out here.
Uh hey, does anyone wanna see my unit?
Uh, I probably will, but not you. You're too much of a butt-monkey. Huh huh.
Butt-dumpling...
Dill-wad...
Butt-snatch...
Yeah, I'm hoping to do some sluts too. Heh heh. Do they have lots of sluts in Las Vegas?
You'll have to speak up son. I have this ringing in my ears. My doctor says it could be related to my heart palpitations. I've had two operations on my heart.
Dammit!  Where's that damn unit??!!
Chief, we found a witness that says he saw two teenagers leaving Dallas' room shortly before we arrived.
Bork, don't you realize what kids today are capable of? Don't you read the papers?
Chief, I swear, we tore that bus apart. They couldn't have...
Whoa, huh huh. Cool.
Uh, my butt and your...uh, butt.
Uh, huh huh, this fat dude. He said we could do you. And he was gonna pay us.
Uh, you want us to do a guy? Huh huh. No way.
Two hours.
De<u>ceased</u>.  I don't know where it came from.
In heaven there wouldn't be dust on the wallpaper.
Arrogant.  That's Jane Butterfield all right...
Wait.
No.  But it's somewhere without big worms.
We probably wouldn't mind sharing the house with people who were --
It's <u>not</u> stupid.  We're ghosts. Do you want this woman for breakfast for 125 years?  Moan louder!
I didn't do that one... Hmmm.
Maybe we should knock first?
I don't care, I've changed my mind.  ... I feel <u>really</u> confident.  We're getting better at this stuff.  We can scare them off ourselves -- tonight!  I've got an idea.  You're going to love it... I'm going to hate it.
Little black party dresses?
Just a hunch.
God, if this is true this is like, amazing!  I kinda like it up here. Can I visit you sometimes?
Uh-uh.  Only if you got <u>above</u> a C on science.
Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work I go!
We have to start simpler, is that it?
And if we need <u>you</u> again, how do we...?
We're...
I'm so sorry we frightened you. What were you doing?
Are you Juno, our case worker?
We need help.  We deserve help.
Pity.  Murderers seem to have an easy time of it.  Just look at Amityville.  He was one of my boys.  Didn't have to give that one any lessons. From day one... But I must be off ... I've got a planeload of football players crashed in the midwest... they need a lot of help, just with the basics.
And live in what, our station wagon?
Yeah.
Yes.
Good girrrl!
You've <u>got</u> to say it!
How'd you like to have the biggest boobs in the world?  Right now.  I can do it if I get out.
You've got to help them.
Otho, why didn't you just come in the door?
There's only one Chinese restaurant in town, darling, the owners are Irish and Irish people happen to cook Cantonese.  They don't know better.
What's he going to do?  Viciously rearrange their environment?
Why not?
Let me have it.
Stepmother.
I'm lonely.
Come on.  Leave their stuff alone.
Then we own a whole <u>town</u> full of nowhere.
It wasn't a joke.
Of course, her favorite color! How <u>beautiful</u>!
That's Charles' study.  But you don't have to even look in there. He'll love whatever you do to it.  He's such a sheep.
We're dealing with Tracy and Hepburn here, a very sophisticated pair.  We must protect them, treat them with respect, <u>nur</u>ture them.
Look at the tiny figures.
Oh, they're still here.  They're Just not showing up.
I don't know.
As flies the lizard Serpent fell; As goblin vizard, At the spell Of pale wizard, Sinks to hell; The buried, dead, and slain... Rise again.
Yes, Robert. But it's not bad.
Yes, Ben told me to be in his room at ten o'clock.
Thank you, Robert.
In a minute, Robert - in a minute... Chauncey, I would like to ask a favor of you...
I wanted some fresh air, Robert. How is Mr. Gardiner?
Yes, he is different... Not the kind of person one usually meets in Washington.
He's very intense, and internal, don't you think?
Good. It might be pleasant for a couple of days.  ... Robert... Is there any improvement...?
You really care for him, don't you, Eve?
I think we'd better go look for him.  David!
I see.  Mr. Franklin, I must ask you and Miss Hayes to keep this incident with Mr. Gardiner to yourselves. There's no telling what he was involved in, and the matter may be extremely confidential. So please, not a word.
Yes, I have seen that show on television.
No. I like this attic very much.
Yes. I am.
It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.
My name is Chance.
No. It won't do that.
No. The Old Man died and Louise left.
I am a very good gardener.
Hello, Eve.
Yes, so do we.
Good night, Eve.
No, Eve. I don't read the papers.
Yes, Eve. I know that.
Yes. It's very good, Eve.
Hello, Eve.
Yes. I've been looking for you, too, Eve.
I have nothing more to say.
Yes. It's a very good show.
Yes, Eve. I shall yield too.
Yes, I agree, I think so too.
Do you think so? Do you think so?
Yes. I am very hungry.
I see. I would like to work in your garden.
Thank you, Ben. The garden that I left was such a place. Everything which grew there was with the labor of my own hands. I planted seeds and watered them and watched everything grow.
Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore.
You're looking much better today, Ben.
I see, Ben.
Thank you, Ben.
Senator Rowley's widow, Sophie, is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring Ambassador Skrapinov of the Soviet Union... I think it's rather obvious that Robert won't allow me to attend, so - would you go in my place, and escort Eve?
I can't write.
Yes. I would like to go to Rand Memorial Hospital.
Yes.
No. I'm not badly injured. But my leg is very sore.
I agree.
Yes. I was there with Ben.
Yes, I know the garden very well. I have worked in it all my life. It is a good garden and a healthy one; its trees are healthy and so are its shrubs and flowers, as long as they are trimmed and watered in the right seasons. The garden needs a lot of care. I do agree with the President; everything in it will grow strong, and there is plenty of room in it for new trees and new flowers of all kinds.
Yes. We need a very good gardener.
Thank you.
I live here.
Yes. I remember when he came. He was very fat and had short hair and showed me some pictures from a funny little book.
No, Thomas. But I have seen the Army on television.
Are you related to the deceased, Mr. Chance?
But you won't sign, correct?
... Oh, really...
That is correct. In a garden, growth has its season. There is spring and summer, but there is also fall and winter. And then spring and summer again...
... Nothing.
Try again.
I said - try again.
I may be a shut-in, but I do not lack for news. I'm sorry you had to go through all that.
Thank you, Wilson. That will be fine.
Would you two excuse me for a moment?
... It's very bizarre - I don't know what to think...
Look, Johanna...
Apparently the White House shares our curiosity - they have also launched an investigation, and, according to our sources, neither the F.B.I. nor the C.I.A. has met with success.
Very good, Your Excellency.
Well, we do have data from Honeycutt's sources, Chief - but it isn't pertinent.
Yes, sir.
A coup d'etat! Of course, that was foreseen by Lenin himself!
I'm sorry, too. Well, Nancy wanted me to send along her best to the two of you - and, Ben, I want to thank you for your time and thoughts.
Take care of yourself, Ben.
This is my fiancee Maxine.
Malkovich!
Craig, listen, honey, I've been thinking... maybe you'd feel better if you got, you know, a job or something.
Would you check in on Elijah? He seems to be a little under the weather this morning.
Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?
We have to make it an early night.
Hmmm.
Hi.
Right.
I'm scared.
We'll talk about it in the car.
Don't crowd me, Craig.
Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.
You're right. You know I was thinking that we should have Maxine over for dinner. Since you two are partners and all. It might be a nice gesture.
It'll be okay. I'll fix my lasagna. We’ll smoke a joint.  Tensions will melt away.
What?
No they're not.
Yes.
Me and John.
Yeah, well welcome to the nineties.
What the hell, darling. Close early today, live dangerously.
Yeah but I didn't do anything about it. Out of respect for our marriage.
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, "he's some kind of monster."
I suppose. But they got here first, the lousy bastards. So now it's all over, I guess.
Let me try.
Not at all, Dr. Lester. I simply misspoke.
Dr. Lester, while I am flattered that you share your feelings with me, I believe perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable environment for this type of discussion.
Ah. yes, the little door.  There is a short film on the little door in the orientation room in exactly two minutes. If you hurry, you'll just make it.
I see. Are you unhappy at our little company?
How dreary - to be - Somebody / How public - like a Frog / To tell one's name - the livelong June / To an admiring Bog!
Just.
You might want to check those tarot cards one more time.
It better be.
Good. We'll sell tickets.
Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going to offer a partnership to you, but this way it's more money for me.
I'll protect you, Dollface.
Sounds good. Oblique but intriguing. Phone it in.
I'm glad you learned sign language, Elijah, but I'm tired of your nagging. I'm tired of this conversation. I'm tired period. What has the world ever done for me that I should feel personally responsible for saving it?
Can I be anyone I want?
And as I said, sir, we can't very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel Malkovich.
Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad we can't kill him.
I like that.
But I think I have another plan.
Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show.
I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can handle it.
Fine. Let's drop it.
Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.
Think, Jew florist?
Do you?
I'm sure you're not going crazy.
You're crazy to let go of a chick who calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a friend.
It's Craig in there, I can tell.
That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich.
One hour.
Really? Well, you know, he's quite good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have a session with Malkovich I have to attend. I'll speak with you soon.
Because if you missed any, I just happen to have copies here you can take with you when you leave now.
We'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.
Broadway's finest three hours. It's about the suppression of the individual. Conformity as God in modern society.
Nothing but acting to hide behind, buddy-boy.
Great then.
It's just that I fantasize about you and, well, speaking to you now has gotten me sort of excited and...
Oh, I'm really glad you called.
Oh sure. It's very rewarding...
I can explain about the portal, darling.
Yeah. I've figured out how to hold on as long as I want. Oddly enough, it's all in the wrists.
He's a selfish bastard.
Busy day, my little fire chief. Why don't you climb into bed, and I'll meet you there in just...
Whatever.
If I call them, and they come what on earth am I going to say to them.
Can't say. It's something can't be planned.
I'm saying they came into my yard.
Was a time I knew what was.
The boys wouldn't have left if Halle were here.
Beloved..She's mine       I am Beloved
YOUR FACE IS MINE.
WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME WHO AM YOU?
Baby, don't be like that.
Don't pay to complain.
Haven't seen her since that day. Ella thinks she might be waiting in the woods for another chance but..I don't think so. Mama thinks she's gone for good. Says she can feel it.
I will.
I want to see Mr. and Mrs. Bodwin.
Fine. But what would I do at night?
DO YOU FORGIVE ME?
NO!...She wanted me to do it.
Mama?
Was over to Baby Suggs.
Unrile yourself, Stamp. It's only a few days he been there.
Her who?
I run him off.
I told him...Showed him the newspaper. About Sethe. Read it to him. He left that very day.
Sure he knew her. Her boy Halle, too.
Well I...I did get offered one place but I just wanted to be off by myself a spell.
I don't want to know.
She was only-
All he can. All he can.
Devil's confusion. What's this I hear about you not getting out of bed?  I saw Denver. She tell you?
You got to get up from here, girl.
She left me. She's gone again.
Yes sir.
No, man, nothing is fucked here--
You don't know shit, Lebowski.
Yes sir.  It is our most modestly priced receptacle.
My rug.
Rug-peers did not do this.  I mean look at it.  Young trophy wife. Marries a guy for money but figures he isn't giving her enough.  She owes money all over town--
I'm going home, Donny.
Thank you, Donny.
I got eighteen dollars, Dude.
Were you listening to the story, Donny?
I'm shomer shabbas.
Where's your car, Dude?
Lebowski on the right?
And what do you do, sir?
...Also, my rug was stolen.
Sure.  Take it easy, Dude--I know that you will.
On you, maybe.
Does the Pope shit in the woods?
Relax, man!  No physical harm intended!
Yeah man.
Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?
Sex.  The physical act of love. Coitus.  Do you like it?
You're not interested in sex?
I'm getting to your rug. My  father and I don't get along; he doesn't approve of my lifestyle and, needless to say, I don't approve of his. Still, I hardly wish to make my father's embezzlement a police matter, so I'm proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to.
Here's the name and number of a doctor who will look at it for you.  You will receive no bill.  He's a good man, and thorough.
The main guy, Dieter--
Well--yeah, I guess--
Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean, you know him?
Is he pretending to be the abductor?
Look, Jeffrey, you don't really kidnap someone that you're acquainted with.  You can't get away with it if the hostage knows who you are.
Uh-huh.
Well yes, what did you think this was all about?  Fun and games?
I want a child.
Exactly.  What happened to your face? Did Jackie Treehorn do that as well?
What?
Yeah man, it really tied the room together--
There's no fucking reason--here's my point, Dude--there's no fucking reason--
Walter, this is not a guy who built the rail- roads, here, this is a guy who peed on my--
Walter, he peed on my rug--
You're fucking twenty minutes late. What the fuck is that?
Huh?
Fucking dog has papers, Dude.--Over the line!
You know Dude, I myself dabbled with pacifism at one point.  Not in Nam, of course--
It's your roll.
Well call them up and explain it to 'em, Walter!  Your plan is so fucking simple, I'm sure they'd fucking understand it!  That's the beauty of it Walter!
Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars parked in the trunk of our car out here?
Well, certainly that's a possibility, Dude--
But Walter--
They're gonna kill her, Walter, and then they're gonna kill me--
What about the toe?
The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.
All but one man died?  There at Bitter Creek?
Not exactly a lightweight.
Yeah, go figure.  Well we'll go out there after the, uh, the.
I understand.  That's why I picked up the phone.
What's your point, Dude?
Yeah?
Okay, but how does all this add up to an emergency?
You know this!
Shit, Dude, I didn't know.  I wouldn't've done it if I knew he was a fucking crybaby.
Come on, Walter!.
No Dude.
Dude, I'm--it was an accident!
So no funny stuff.  Okay?
I understand sir.  Could you slide your shorts down please?
You're just looking for a handout like every other--are you employed, Mr. Lebowski?
My wife is not the issue here. I hope that my wife will someday learn to live on her allowance, which is ample, but if she doesn't, sir, that will be her problem, not mine, just as your rug is your problem, just as every bum's lot in life is his own responsibility regardless of whom he chooses to blame.  I didn't blame anyone for the loss of my legs, some chinaman in Korea took them from me but I went out and achieved anyway. I can't solve your problems, sir, only you can.
Sure!  Fuck it!  That's your answer! Tattoo it on your forehead!  Your answer to everything!
Sure.  That and a pair of testicles.
Am I wrong!?
He's half yours, partner.
Someday.
They tell bedtime stories about you. Blade the big, bad boogie-man.  Frankly, I'm disappointed.  That you were willing to come along so easily, I mean.  Without any assurances.
What the hell are you doing, Blade?
The House of Pain.
We need it.  Sensations are addictive and pain cuts the deepest.  Tattoos, piercings, tribal scarring -- because we regenerate, none of it's permanent.  So we have to take it to the next level. To remind us we're alive.
Right.  So why is he dying?  He doesn't appear to have any broken bones, no entry wounds of any kind -- what's killing him?
Save it.  I don't want to hear your words.  Let's do this NOW!!!
I don't think so.
I wouldn't read too much into it.
Sounds like a plan.
I wouldn't worry about it.
Why don't you ask your girlfriend?
Look, I care about the humans who are dying, not you, got it?
You're wasting your time, Blade.  The flechette's a dud.
You need to ratchet those 'nads of yours down a few notches, paco.
Yeah, but you fangs can see in the dark. What am I supposed to do?
Nomak said something to Blade in Greek. Athelfiki singenia ex amato.  Where did he learn that?
You experimented on your own, son?
They've made contact with the Reapers.
Scud.
Tweaked the phosphor rod, modified the collimated beam, wanna concentrate the light, get something like a UV laser going.
Blade doesn't talk about the old days much.
Are we bringing home strays now?
Wait.
I don't buy it.
Not anymore. You've seen one of them. You won't be allowed to live after that.
Do it. You'll be dead before you can file the complaint.
Figured they'd send someone after you. Thought I'd wait around and see who showed up.
And that's a good thing?
What do you see here?
How can you tell?
Those aren't real memories. No one has that kind of recall.
I've been better --
It's the only way. You know that. We'll never get out of here alive if you don't.
There's only one alternative to the serum.
Then what is it?
Sometimes --
Please. You and the other Elders wouldn't know what to do with these texts if your lives depended on it.  Which, of course, they do.
A few thousand scattered about the globe. In the past, we've had to restrict our numbers for fear of discovery. That won't be necessary after tonight.
Get away from him!
Go on, I'll be fine!
We weren't sure we could trust you.
What happens if he doesn't take the serum?
Habit, mostly, just like this.
I didn't. He was cruel enough to let me live.  Even gave me a souvenir to remember him by.
I don't know, but the back-up generator should've kicked in.
Hey, folklore--
Join the club.
--bad boys, mean boys, <u>cowardly</u> boys--just like Domini.
--my God, Nick???
Bullshit! Talk!
She e-mailed me yesterday this is where we should meet her.
No idea, just talked to her on the 'Net--she's very good.
Buried deep under 200 years worth of soil, ash, and compost layers.
--whatever; that's her.
You sure?
What is <u>this</u>?
--<u>whoever</u>--they built an entire house <u>around</u> a <u>tree</u>. Sticking up right through the living room. Somebody like to explain that to me?
--fine, later, fine.
What?
Little boys. Looking up my skirt as I danced. Giggling.
--no, what's wrong with you?
--fuck your bullshit pieties! You were the next to die, asshole!
--yeah, the goddamn stoners! Who you think stole the stuff!?
Oh, who did then? Blair Witch? Snatching equipment to make her own sequel?
What? That made her lose the baby?
If I could do that, I'd be at the goddamn racetrack, not here.
--go!
Oh, for chrissake, she was an actor.
So where the hell am I going to sleep?
No.
No sense at all.  I'm a little stressed.
--Cotter: shut up.
I spend a lot of time on e-Bay. Buying, selling--sometimes buying then re-selling at substantial mark-up, sometimes just selling crap I find in the street.
Still don't see it--
My room, asleep, last I checked.
--anywhere, anywhere, all up and live, all the time--fucking owl--
Next time try putting on shoes--
--hell, I don't think I'm ever leaving this place again--
Anna's the witch.
--Graduate Thesis--
--a Wiccan--
I am.
I'm not finished.
--now there.
No problem, just give us 'til dawn and we're gone.
--I dunno, I just woke up--
Spite.
A Cyber Entrepreneurialship.
--great: we can watch Domini sleep for hours--or, shit, maybe if we stay at it for a couple of days, maybe a deer'll dash by!
--oh, Jesus--
Enough to keep sane.
I can't!
What're you nuts--
--shit!!!
Ancient runes--
--and we brought it back with us!
--no.
Motion. Stop there. Play it again.
What'd you say?
Get some more beer.
--it's not a could've--there <u>was</u>, Nick. And it fucked up Anna, and did something to Domini, and it caused my father to die, and it's here <u>with</u> us in this place <u>now</u>. And I don't have one single idea in hell what's going to happen next, just that it's going to happen to one of us. And then the other. And then the other. It's going to get into our <u>brains</u>.
I dunno it's anything. It's a name Anna's mentioned--from her dreams.
Hey, chemicals, fear, sleep- deprivation--and a round-the-clock obsession with the occult--hell've a recipe for a mind-fuck.
Don't! You're making me lose my grip.
--or Lyme Disease or poison sumac, or God knows what-else we could have picked up in the woods.
There are <u>other</u> explanations! She is not the goddamn witch, that's insane!
I don't....
His daughter, for God's sake-- I need to know if he's heard from her this morning.
--his name's Von Teer! His daughter's named Domini!--
No.
No, I--
I just gotta see a guy.
What?
Door's locked. Nothing there.
I couldn't believe it either...
...You ever get tired?
I don't know. It's early... I love you.
Abby--
In the trunk.
See, Wednesday's the special on RC Cola. I don't know if I explained about the TV option. If there's a TV in the room, you got to pay the option.
Ever durned one.
...Hell.
No. It just made them feel better.
It's not strictly legal.
So it would seem.
Of course.
How would I know?
Not here tonight. Wasn't here last night. He's especially not back in his office.
No, you do, cowboy. You been to the bar?
What's that?
What?
No. I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.
I'm not sick.
Okay honey. that sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.
Okay.
The criminals are winning.
Yeah.
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
Only you. and the photo lab.
Yes sir.
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
Shut up. It's daddy. shithead.
Jeffrey nothing.
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
Well.
I . I don't know.
Nothing. Are you alright?
No.
It's okay. It's okay.
No. What is happening?
. same here.
Frank is coming?
Men are crazy. then they put their craziness into me. then it makes me crazy. then they aren't so crazy for awhile. then they put their craziness in me again.  . it's burning me. but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell. it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
Okay. soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
No.  Hi baby.
It's okay. it's okay.
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. to make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue. blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
What?
There ya go.
I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
Am I bothering you?
Terrible. boring.
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
I don't really know much but bits and pieces . I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear. there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
Not really, why?  You want to see the building?. Come on, I'll show you.
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. .Aren't you curious about my plan?
Alright.
I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
Oh, okay. can I call?
He got a little jealous.
. OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. this is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. they have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. the ears were for her a warning to stay alive. there is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". you saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
Goodnight.
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Oh yeah?
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
I can't dance fast.
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
For good?. I can't. Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
Of course, Jeffrey.
I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean. no offense.
Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
Yeah, I know.
No. No thank you.
You can change it if you want to.
Okay.
This is a one time thing, Gusto.  One and I'm out.  Give me a good price for old time's sake.  What do you think?
You happy, baby?
You'll see for yourself.
Baby, you didn't have to come.
Which brings me to rule number three: which says, fuck rules one and two, skip bail and take off.
What?  Yeah, sure.
My clothes, your clothes.  What does it matter?
We want some grass.
No.
Here's the best part.  We can charge five-hundred a pound.
Get me a six pack.
I don't like a lot of conversation, Diego.
Twenty-six months?  For murder?  I must be your lawyer.
Because they caught me?
And that's wholesale.  Cut it a few times and retail, you're looking at two, three-hundred thousand.
Allo?
We make the pick-up, refuel once more in the Bahamas, and fly back on Sunday with the mom and pop traffic.
It is bad.  It's chump change.  We might as well be hauling suitcases across the border.  We're getting screwed.
What the fuck is going on?  When did you get out of jail?
Just a friend.
Yeah.  You do the talking.
You're a lucky man, Diego.
Que es lo que quieren de me, hijueputas campesinos?
What?
No more brothers, Diego.
I'm just happy that George has found someone he cares for.
You know why I'm here.  You know what I have to do.  I came here for permission. Out of respect, Pablo.  This is bullshit, he's making me look like a punk.
I just don't know what you're thinking. I don't understand your choices.  You know, the police are looking for you.
Yeah, I know.  This is it, isn't it?
I'll tell her.
Did you know I died two weeks after you sent me that tape?
The set-up is wrong.  We're doing all the legwork, and at the end of the day, we're still paying retail.  We're getting middled.
He's getting middled, too.  And Derek's our partner.  What's good for us is good for him.
Yeah.  I know.  She did that before.
Can you lift the furnace.  I need money.
Don't give me that shit.  You just better do something.
Yeah, so I've been thinking.  I love her, y'know?  I kind of want to have her.  I've been away for so long.  Make up for the missed time, you know?
I know.  Well, that's all I really wanted to say.  So, okay, then.
Yeah.  I'm fine.  I'm good.
Well, I got a call from Pablo.  He said this thing with Diego is a disaster. He's giving up lab locations, names, bank accounts, he was very pissed off. Pablo said to take him down.  His exact words were "Fuck Diego."
What's happening to us?
Just to walk with you.  I want to be your dad again.
You know I can't.  Mom will never let me go.
You swear?
Yes, he's sitting right there at the end of the table.
Who's the co-pilot?
Jesus, George, fifteen percent.  That's an extra two-hundred large.
Yes, I am.
Very nice.  I'll take it.
All of it.  As much as you've got.  A couples thousand pounds.  I'll be back in a week with a plane.
Shit, yeah.  Do you know how much money I could make if I had this stuff back east?
Are we good?  Yeah, we're good.  We're beautiful.  We're perfect.  This is A grade, one-hundred percent pure Colombian cocaine, Ladies and Gentlemen. Disco shit.  Pure as the driven snow. Good riddance.
Jesus Christ, I'm getting a boner just looking at it.
Don't be such a pussy.
Let's try to be precise then. The word "torture" does not appear in our orders. We have always spoken of interrogation as the only valid method in a police operation directed against unknown enemies. As for the NLF, they request that their members, in the event of capture, should maintain silence for twenty-four hours, and then, they may talk. Thus, the organization has already had the time necessary to render useless any information furnished ... What type of interrogation should we choose? ... the one the courts use for a crime of homicide which drags on for months?
I'll explain.
Sure. By shooting at me.
I don't even know your name yet ...
C'mon ... you're exaggerating. The orders were to shoot him in the back.
Because we aren't ready yet for the French. Before attacking, we must have safe places from which to depart and find refuge. Of course, there is the Casbah. But even the Casbah isn't safe yet. There are too many drunks, pushers, whores, addicts, spies ... people who talk too much ... people who are ready to sell themselves, undecided people. We must either convince them or eliminate them. We must think of ourselves first. We must clean out the Casbah first. Only then will we be able to deal with the French. Do you understand, Ali?
No, it's better if he doesn't. The house is filled with new people.
No, they'll do even more. We've given them the opportunity to do a lot more ... Do you understand what I mean? Starting tomorrow, they won't be groping in the dark any more; every shop and every worker who strikes will be a known enemy, a self-confessed criminal ... And they will be able to pass to the offensive. Have you thought of this?
But Kader told me that you weren't in favor of the strike.
That's true ... Wars aren't won with terrorism, neither wars nor revolutions. Terrorism is a beginning but afterward, all the people must act ... This is the reason for the strike, and its necessity: to mobilize all Algerians, count them and measure their strength ...
I'm sorry. Tomorrow. Tonight is out of the question.
You've got to get me something I can use, Charlie.
So, what good is it to us if it's been erased?
For starters I'd like to know why she left the house and didn't report the death?
Had to.  I also interviewed three women who were in past relationships with Marsh.  There's no evidence that he had anything but straight sex prior to meeting Miss Lawson.
Then you can go.
The official cause?
We know Marsh had a head cold.   We found cocaine mixed with water in a nasal spray container on the nightstand.  The coke would contract the nasal membrane the same as any decongestant, but for a much shorter time.  He'd keep using more and more -- never knowing what he was taking.
We found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood.
It would be an added stress to his heart.
Well -- he died on a Sunday and I have the weekends off -- but they were ripping at each other with both barrels Friday afternoon.
Alright -- I'm going to allow his testimony.
Did Miss Lawson ever give you any indication why she was leaving?
Counsel approach the bench.
She planned this.  She wanted us to find the nasal spray.
Objection.  Your Honor, we don't know where this tape is from.  Who made it -- or under what circumstances it was made.
Your Honor, Mr. Roston lived with the defendant for many months.  I feel that his opinion is valid in substantiating the character of the Miss Lawson.
No.
I opened the bathroom door one day and saw Miss Lawson pouring Cocaine out of a vial.
No.  She stopped by to pick up some papers.
It was wild.  She was constantly trying to get me more and more worked up -- kinky things.  I tried to satisfy her the best I could, but it was difficult in my condition.
She left me.
It was like she was trying to push me as far as she could.  She called it opening new doors.
She started touching herself and telling me how much she wanted me. She reached down and put me inside her.  My doctor had warned me about exerting myself -- but you really don't think of those things at a moment like that.  You just think about how beautiful this woman is -- how much you want her.  How deeply you want to please her.  At first it started off slowly -- but the rhythm built and built.    Every time I got close to an orgasm she would stop.  Eventually I started to have trouble breathing.  Rebecca just kept going -- faster and faster.  No matter what I said she wouldn't stop. I really thought for a moment I was going to die.
At a dinner party -- about eight months ago.
We stopped seeing each other.
She said that those weren't any good -- because their use would be detected and the police would know the victim had been poisoned.  She wanted to know if there was a drug that would induce a heart attack but could also be used to enhance a sexual high.
No.
And after that didn't you continuously harass Miss Lawson?
That's all Dr. Paley.
Yes.  I've been seeing her for over a year.
Yes.
I'm a nurse.  I used to work at Roseburg Memorial Hospital.  Dr. Paley's on staff there.
Yes -- cocaine.
What other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial?
He said that if it kept up she was going to kill him.  That his heart couldn't take it.
Well, think about it.  Isn't it possible?
It must have been horrible.  Having to go there -- seeing them together - - knowing he was sleeping with her in the same bed he did with you.
You've tried it?  Isn't it true that you've been in and out of Rehab centers for the last four years?
There's an item you picked up that's marked.  Will you read it?
Then you would have gotten your money?
You didn't know about it before that?
There are no charges against you. I'm here to decide if I'm going to represent you should that occur.  Did you kill him?
You're assuming the District Attorney is going to file charges.
I think the photographer's probably a voyeur.
Andrew loved this old cabin.  He always dreamed about moving to Tahiti -- living in a hut and becoming a beach-bum.  I could never imagine myself doing that -- but somehow when he talked about it, he made it sound so alive - - so wonderful.  Soft ocean breezes and beautiful sunsets -- leaving the world and it's problems behind.  I wish he'd had a chance to do it.
What?
I don't use cocaine anymore.  If she says she saw me doing it she's lying.
It's only the beginning.
You can see me now.
Honey.
I'm not leaving without that tape.
She allegedly humped him to death?
Is Mom yelling at you too?
Mr. Roston?
Are you able to back up this allegation -- or are you fishing?
I am relaxing.
I don't know yet.  I want to hear what she says at her statement tomorrow.
Yeah -- fine.  Excuse me.  I'll be right back.
Where have you been?
You used to like to touch me -- to make love to me.
That's too bad.
No -- never.
Why are there two deeds here?
I'm sure you haven't done anything. Have some iced tea. How are the kids?
Mom's orders.
Well, there's a problem.
Goddamn sonofabitch! I don't want to hear anymore! Sonofabitch! Burn the damn thing! I don't want to hear it! Throw it away!
Sshhh. "After going through the safety deposit box, I'm sure you'll find you're way to this letter. It's hard to write this to my own children. I could let this die with the rest of me, I suppose.  But as one gets older, one fears subside. What becomes more and more important is to be known -- known for all that you were during this brief stay. Row said it seems to me to leave this earth without hose you love the most ever really knowing who you were. It's easy for a mother to love her children no matter what -- it's something that just happens. I don't know if it's as simple for children. You're all so busy being angry at us for raising you wrong. But I thought it was important to give you that chance. To give you the opportunity to love me for all that I was..."
Yeah. But I thought she died.
Boy. All these years I've resented not living the wild life in some place like Paris and all the time I could've moved back to Iowa... Are you drunk?
I think I better. Between the book and the coffee, I'm this close to raping the busboy.
-- for over twenty years because that's what I was taught -- you stick with it! Normal people don't get divorced. I can't remember the last time my husband made love to me so intensely that he transported me to Europe, for Christ's sake -- quite frankly, I don't think he ever did! And now I find out in between bake sales, my mother was Anais Nin!
No. What a tragedy. What happened?
Hi. I made some brown betty. I sent Floyd off to town with the boy. I said -  "Floyd, I'm going to visit my girlfriend and spend the afternoon and that's all there is to it. He said who's going to make lunch? I said I'm taking a sick day. Eat at the dinner." Isn't that hilarious?  He didn't dare raise an eyebrow -- I don't even want to tell you how late he was out last night with those good for nothings from the Sandford ranch. I am so sorry, honey, I let two days pass before I came by, but with the boy home the time just escapes me. Have you heard from Richard? How's the fair? God, it's hot.
That's it.
No. I was just going to have some iced tea then split the atom, but that can wait.  I just have to get my shoes.
Maybe it's because I live here.
How long you been married?
Oh, yeah. Actually, I had an assignment in Greece and I had to go through Bari to get the boat at Brindisi. But it looked so pretty I got off and stayed for a few days. Breathtaking country.
I don't mind waiting.
Oh! You caught me.
Want another cigarette?
A little place with cabins. The something-Motor Inn. I haven't checked in yet.
I think so.
I feel so embarrassed.
But I... We don't even know each other.
Sure. Men cook. We don't all eat bananas with our feet, ya know.
I'm kind of obsessed by it, actually.
No, you rub it on you. I have some in the truck. Don't go away.
Yes.
No.
That's not what you're saying. I know it's not the same. What you're saying is, it's not as good. Or it's not as normal or proper.
The light was fading. Huh-huh.
Oh, hi. Look, I'm running a little late, but I'll still...
Oh, how is he?
What?
No. I couldn't.
Because I already tried once.
No, I don't mind.
What?
You're right, you know. We don't have much time.
To do what? Be with someone who needs everyone and no one in particular? I mean, what would be the point. Would you pass the butter?
I know you! What can this possibly mean to anyone who doesn't "need" meaning -  "Who goes with the Mystery" -- who pretends he isn't scared to death.
I don't want you to say anything. I don't need you to say anything.
You won't be made to feel! Period. You've carved out this little part for yourself in the world where you get to be a voyeur, a hermit and a lover whenever you feel like it and the rest of us are just supposed to feel so incredibly grateful for the brief time you've touched our lives! Well, go to hell! It isn't human not to feel lonely -- it isn't human not to afraid! You're a hypocrite and you're a phony!
WHY?
For who?
What about us? What about me?
Yeah. It could get better.
Yes. And I've accepted.
I said to him Cary you're being ridiculous. You're more than half her age. He said no one had ever been that honest with him and he falls in love with me.
I'm very sad but Richard said that since it's Cary Grant, he completely understands. I'm also taking Mrs. Delaney away from this town. She'll be living with Cary and I in Beverly Hills.
Well you should all go to bed early. I'll do the cleaning up.
I'm not tired. I thought I might finish Carolyn's skirt.
I can't sleep.
What's she like?
What happened?
I don't care what it says! Maybe Mama was delirious, you know. She didn't know what she was saying. If she wanted to be cremated, why the hell did she let dad buy two plots, huh?
WHAT!
Who the hell is Lucy Delaney?
Well, close the fucking door by all means.  But don't expect me to go down there and do it.
How the hell should I know?
Yeah?
So what the hell's the good news?
I believe in you guys.  You are the real shit.  And you know it.  Now I'm putting everything I got into this cuz I think we can make it happen, but you gotta put a little in too.  Now all I"m asking is that everybody do their part.  We'll move some shit in, and take shifts, or all crash together here --
Wh-wh-whooo?
I do alright.  Everybody's happy.
Ain't no big thang.  It's just a po' man's free base.  Here, check it out.
Sounds like mama needs a brand new bag.
Hush, baby.
That's your dream, Homes.  Not mine.  I don't want to leave this street.  Ever. The status quo is totally cool with me.
No brother.  I wouldn'ta.  I never done a man - any man.  Let alone a brother like that.  Course, as you can see, no good deed goes unfucked.  Now the question is, if the good get fucked, what we got saved up for the bad?  You about to find out.
You mean as opposed to your life?
I don't want you meeting around that house.  You stay away from those kids. And away from that dog.
But if it's him.  If he's really come back, won't he know us?  Love us?
But how do you know?  Maybe he just wanted to see us?  And now he's gone again.  And you've all killed my father for the second time.
No we won't, Momma.  I'll just have them call and tell Patrick it's us.
My God.  My dress.  We have to find it. And burn it.  And shut the door.
Naw.  But they will be.  They're the best.
My momma says every house is two houses. Every street, two streets.  There's a whole city, a whole world, kinda beside, on top, just below this one.  The city of the dead.
What?  Oh yeah.  Coming.
I'm sure I can make your mother like me. But then do I gotta worry 'bout your father?
Don't worry about it.  I'll stay with the boys.
I can't!
Can't be done.  That place already died and gone to hell.
Like you always said, Pop, look for the undervalued.
Daddy?
You better hope not.  Cause it's like they say, four can keep a secret, if three are dead.
No, Eddie.  It's just that, I dunno.  He was tall, and thin, and like a shadow, his face was just a blur.  All I remember is the voice.  It was smooth and low and it didn't seem to be comin' out of his mouth.
I am the future.  I am all colors.  All races.  All creeds.  I am the melting pot.  I am the tossed salad.  I am post racial.
What's that, Johnnie?
You're a dead man!  A fucking dead man!
Yeah, I know.
No, Caesar, gimme the gun.
I can't.  I can't.
What the fuck is going on?
Caesar, this is Corky.  Corky, Caesar.
There's no time.
What are you talking about?
Why?
Caesar, I know Johnnie.  It was him. I screamed when I saw him.  I couldn't believe I missed them.  I knew you were going to be upset so I thought I'd apologize and give Gino the Scotch.  I honked a couple of times but he didn't stop.
The money?  The money's gone.
Bullshit!  You don't need me!  You've never needed me!  I can't help you! Understand?!  I have to get out.
What happened to them?
We're going to need some time.
Not until he has the money!
Ha!  What a load of crap.  Look at yourself, Caesar.  You're a thug. |You launder money for the mob.  You rent women like you rented this apartment.
Good idea.
No.  Rajeev's in India.
Either pull the trigger or get that thing out of my face.
Leave your phone on the hook.
This is the police, ma'am.
Gunfire?  Is this a joke?
Pretty much.  One day at a time.
Yeah, see, I'm kind of a night person, so I was wondering if it wasn't a terrible inconvenience if you could wait a bit before using power tools.
No, it isn't your fault.  The walls here are just so thin.
That is so amazing.  I'm in awe of people who can fix things.  My dad was like that.  We never had anything new.  Whenever something broke he would open it up, tinker with it and it would work.  His hands were magic.
Truck.  Of course.
Not exactly.
A beer.  Of course.
You have to ask?
They took over a club I was working at.  Caesar started managing it.
Yes, it is.
What are you saying?  That you don't have sex with men?
Don't tell me, you're a workaholic.
He was in love with you, right?
Mickey?
What choice?
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Do you have any idea what you are saying? You are asking me to help you fuck the mob.
You think I'm lying?
Johnnie?
Not much, really.  Caesar was nervous, kept cleaning the apartment.  |The first time, he picked out the dress he wanted me to wear.
He does it right in front of him.
Scotch, Glenlivet.  I remember that Caesar made a huge deal about it.
The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.
Gino travels with a big man named Roy.  Caesar calls him the driver.
Waiting in the apartment next door.
Because of what you are going to tell him.  You have to make it as real as you can.  The moment you open the door with the Scotch in your hand, you will be covered, and that moment is the most important moment in the plan.
It's all right, Violet.  It's working. All we got to do is wait him out and see what he does.
That means he probably will kill Johnnie.
I'm still here.
Don't be sorry.  Help me.
Hey, Johnnie ...
I'm assuming we're exploring that possibility.
We'll make you better.  We can put the pieces back.  We can do that.

Yes, sir...  How can I help you?
One moment, please...  I'm afraid, I have no one by that name registered, sir.
Yes.
Get me out of here.  <u>Please</u>.
<u>No</u>.  No, that was too easy -- 
Then I'll find another ride.
Amnesia?  You're saying you don't remember anything that happened before two weeks ago?
No.
-- which was okay for a while, I was okay with it...  But then -- there's all these other things -- all these other things I know how to do -- and this -- this stuff from the bank and...  I think something bad happened.
I can't believe I slept.
You got me pretty fucking curious.
All this stuff -- it's all about boats.  I think I'm in the shipping business.
...omigod, no...
-- where does this come from? --  How do you have my picture?
-- do what? -- what are you doing? -- he's got my picture --  -- he's -- my God -- look at him -- he's bleeding to death -- my picture -- look! -- he was trying to kill us! -- omigod --
Nykwana Wombosi. 
I don't know. 
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
-- here we go -- I found it --
That old beast?  Miss his breakfast? Not a chance.  It's always something, right?
-- I'm the one that got ripped off! -- not you -- not the United States government -- me -- I'm the one being ripped off!
Hang on... 
-- we're evacuating the building --
Where am I?
<u>Where am I</u>?
Uh - what? - I ...
I haven't got an emergency. Get out of here.
What have you done to my flat?
... have a look.
...Yer nostril?
...sabotage!
... yer ducts.
... new washer.
Yes, I know. It's the backlog, everybody complains. Was it all right otherwise?
David ... in a free society information is the name of the game. You can't win the game if you're a man short.
On yes. Our morale is much higher than theirs, we're fielding all their strokes, running a lot of them out, and pretty consistently knocking them for six. I'd say they're nearly out of the game.
Yes, you've got to get me out of here. I've got to find her.
No, no ... I did that...
Er, I knew you looked different.
I've got numbers all over these - I'm not sure which is the one you want.
You got the wrong man.
So how ...?
What has Tuttle done?
You didn't know as much about this business as you pretended to, did you?
Look after that suit, eh. Barbara chose it for me.
Why?
Get her out of circulation - I've put her on the detention list.
Do you know what you're doing.
Sam ... we're proud to have you at Information Retrieval. Merry Xmas. 
Have you got an Arrest Receipt?
Is it stamped?
If you say so.
Ah.
Who are you?
It's my fucking life.
I know you. I saw you through the floor, didn't I?
Where are you taking me?
A heavy Christmas present.
Looking for you.
Suit me?
What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.
I thought you arrested me.
Let go! We've got to stop!
"Lady bird, lady bird, fly away home, your house is on fire and your children all gone" ... Do you think anyone's hurt?
Go away.
Don't do anything silly.
It's not the machine. There's a mismatch on the personnel code numbers... Ah there we go! That's a B58/732 when it should be a T47/215 ... Tuttle ... he should have £31.06, debited against his account for electrical procedures, not Buttle.
Expediting has put in for electrical procedures in respect of Buttle, Archibald, shoe repair operative, but Security has invoiced Admin for Tuttle, Archibald, heating engineer
What a BITCH!
Dead! Oh no! That's terrible! We'll never get rid of the damned thing! What are we going to do?
You are good to me Sam.
Yes.
Sam Lowry.
Gillian Layton - Suspect S/5173. Truck driver! All enquiries, reference officer 412/L - Room 5001.  That's what I wanted to know. Thank you very much.
You're not listening, mother.
I'm sorry. I don' t want dessert. I don't want promotion. I don't want anything.
Mother? ... What ... what's ... you've got to help me ...
Mistake?
I ... uh ...
No, sir.
No need, sir
Ah yes, the lady is waiting.
Fixed?
Fixed itself.
It's a 27B/6 of course.
Why? I came into this game for adventure - go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man alone. Now they've got the whole country sectioned of and you can't move without a form. I'm the last of a breed. Ah ha! Found it!  There's your problem.
Pregnant.
We are virgins.
Mary, we really have to go.
I was tired. I needed a coffee.
Ten-four, hon.  This is for you.
She said to me, I love the way you talk on the radio.
Ten-four, hon.
What'd you mean IB Bangin? What kind of name is IB Bangin?
What did you say?
No, I'd better not.
I guess there's always a chance.
The first is always the best.
At least he's got people around him.
Go home. Take her home. Get some rest. Not going to find anything out now.
It's okay. They're prescription.  Works better with a little whiskey.
Our Lady of Misery.
He's working a double shift.
You look so different.
How is she?
I was just going to get some food. Pizza. Maybe we could.
Wow, you musta seen some things, huh? What's the worst thing you ever seen?
You must get a lot of overdoses. I bet you picked me up a couple of times.
Maybe not. I was a different person then. Does everybody you meet spill their problems on you like this?
I'm all right. I just can't stand to see people tied up.  I'm in the waiting room for hours, listening to Noel screaming. The only reason he's screaming is 'cause he's tied up.
No problem. Thanks for letting me crash. It was the best sleep I've had in months. I used some of your soap.
The ghosts--
Make a left here. I want to stop.
What about rule number three: Don't get involved with dispatchers named Love.
Can't tell. It was a breech, twins. The other one seems okay, though. Marcus is taking him and the mother to Maternity.
What do you do, just have someone follow him around with a defribilator?
A medical miracle.
Jesus Christ. Nurse Crupp!  Anybody else hurt?
Ten-four. El Toro de Oro. Blast off.
I feel the need, the need for speed. I'm driving out of myself.
I never felt better in my life.
You're crazy.
I'm not hungry.
I eat. I just haven't had coffee yet.
Someone's gonna die someday causa that bum, going to have a cardiac and the only medics will be taking care of Mr. Oh.
Used to be my partner.
One more time!
Yes, Zebra. You'll be driving to the man who needs no introduction, chronic caller of the year three straight and shooting for number four. The duke of drunk, the king of stink, our most frequent flier, Mr. Oh.
You're almost there, you can do it -- can do -- can do.
You write this?
Same old stuff.  I'm watching a man who won three Overseas Press Awards pitch an hors d'oeuvre idea.
Oh, God, no!
London.  That's a promotion!
I don't like the word gay.
No.  It makes me nervous to think about it.  Let's do this.
This conversation is not worthy of you.
Good night.
Right and we have the '81 pilot on the way in -- Nobody else will have him.
I didn't know you were going with him.
You too.
Then it went well.
Call him -- I mean it can wait, right?
This is important to me.
Yeah -- being a basket case.
Because we have the kind of relationship where if I were the Devil, you'd be the only one I told.
Yes, yes.  I know.  Right.  And if it had gone well for me tonight, maybe I'd be keeping quiet about all this...I grant you everything but give me this...he does personify everything you've been fighting against...And I'm in love with you.  How do you like that? -- I buried the lead.
Sit down, stop.
Okay, that's very easy.  Five, six years from now I'll be in town to collect an award representing the surge in foreign coverage by local stations.
Well, we met about three months ago. He works at the surgeon general office. He loves boating.  So, he's been getting me into water skiing.
Well -- my wife got this new job...
Stop it.
Just blunt talk, okay?  I'd really appreciate bluntness.
Wait.  Bullshit me a little...I'm beginning to appreciate it.
Do one thing to me?  Get me one shot at anchoring the Weekend News -- they've never seen me do it.  I think it could turn them around.
It's been a while since you read the news -- I'll have somebody work with you.  Just on superficial performance things.
Move away from me.
Oh, that's nice...  We'll need some new lines.
Oh, come on -- tell us another.
Almost immediately.
Bill...This is hard on all of us and it's no time for compliments. But I think it's extraordinary of you to come down here for this.
Well, you always want to give the credit away, do you?
I'll speak to you soon
Yes, there is.
I spent a fortune on this.
It's started.
No stop where he's all besieged.
Bad manners.
Thanks a lot, Buddy.
Okay.
Tell me I'm on the way in.
I just have two more pen pals and then I'm done.
No.  But, honest.  What are you supposed to say when they keep talking about your looks?  I don't even know what they mean -- "Beat them off with a stick."
Would it help if I got you a tutor?
No, it's awful.  Oh my, it's awful.
I like "godsend."
So great -- right?
Just what do you want from me, anyway? Permission to be a fake?  Stop whining and do something about it.
Hey?
Excited.
Jane, yes.  Tom?  Tom, is that you? Is this Tom?
Says who?  Not important -- ha-ha-ha. I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't tell -- how embarrassing for me. Gosh.
Why, you need me for the story?
It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I really did.  It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice...but it's real and it got me...and I think a lot of the time I'm too conservative about that kind of stuff.  Okay?
I'd like to know.  I'll go along.
I know.  I taped it.
I've got my father coming through tomorrow anyway.  I should get some sleep.
I'll see you at the office.  Good night.
Good night??!
He -- uh -- said he liked you because you looked like you had -- fire and honesty.
You keep coming after me and looking down on me.  It's starting to make me batty.
What I don't know, I can learn and what I know, nobody can teach. Excuse me for saying it about myself, but I think it's true.  What do you think?  Never mind what you think.
Yes, I am.  Thanks.  I mean it.
Then you should stay here.
I'm not knocking it.  It's a great solution.  Not only the storage but you can see everything you have.
Oh yeah?
I already told you I'm not.
Whaddya mean?
I'll pose any way you want.
Anything new?
He made a cat.
Murdered man.
Yeah it was all just an accident.
Oh...
Better!
Well I can't say that Walter!  She's incomparable.  They're both great.
Hm...
You think I'm creative?
Why not?!
Just about anything, Walter.
What?
Oh yes...very nice...very, very nice...
What are you doing here so early?
I wouldn't give up your day job.
Yes...I'm uh...I'm fine.
Listen, I'm going over to Walter's after the place closes.  I want to get a look at Murdered Man.  Do you want to come along?
Nothing...nothing at all.
That's the idea, Walter.  It's the only way to gain recognition. All the big art critics and art dealers would be there, it would be an event.
I do the research.
I think he's looking for you, man... it's all finally catching up with you!
Right.  Ain't no body of work complete without some... nudes -
Yeah, right outside the door!
I was just looking at Carla's picture.
I didn't mean to.
OK...good night Mr. De Santis!
You made...a bust... WALTER  Yeah isn't it wonderful?
I'm holding for Lieutenant Beldere!
Hm.
Oh yeah that was Mayolia, she's a nice girl.  She's kind of strange, though.
Did you like it Mister Brock?
I see the rewards of achievement have come your way.
Good morning Walter!
What do you get?
Really?
Good night, Mrs. Swicker -
Not as single-minded as the others, not as sybaritic.  Almost thoughtful. She's useless.
My arm!  He took my fucking arm!
I had him in my grasp.
Litter, yeah!
I don't know.  Coach said I had to work on my 'ab's.'
Do people ever call you 'Buffy the Buffalo?'  I'm just wondering.
Bummer metaphor.
Let me in.
Get away from here.
My bike!  She's a lesbian, too. She told me.
Guys.  The environment.  I'm telling you, it's totally key.  The earth is in terrible shape, we could al die, and besides, Sting's doing it.
Eeyuu.
I don't know, Mom; I've never met Bobby.
Nothing.
I thought we were meeting here.
Didn't you get my message?
I'm out of here.  Jenny.
It could happen.
Thanks.  Tomorrow morning, I'm on a bus.  I'm gone.
I'll back that up.
I think I could help.  You gonna tell me you don't need help?
For the dance.
I'm going to the senior dance.
You got that right.  I thought you wanted to kill vampires.
Listen, I know you're bummed about your friend, and I'm really sorry...
You say that like it's a bad thing.
Buffy, there's no way you're going out there alone.
'One that reflects the students' growing awareness of and involvement in the world around them.'
See, Cassandra likes it.  Cassandra's my friend.
Like my homework.
I'm sorry.  That was impressive. The...  tumbling.
Yes.
I don't have time for your prattling. I have proof.  You bear the mark.
In the past.  A girl.  Maybe... A Magyar peasant.  An Indian princess. A slave.
China.
Why didn't you ever tell anybody about your dreams?
All right.
Our purposes.
Oh, yes.  And the man from your dreams.  Lothos.
We'll cover it later.
Yes, you used to do gymnastics. But you stopped.  Why?
But you enjoyed it, yes?
Yes, yes.  It would be interesting. A nice cheer.
Oh, several.  Lucretia Borgia, Joseph Mengele, Franklin Pangborn... are any of those names familiar?
They were vampires?
Oh.
What do you want?  Encouragement?  'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I just want to give you a great big hug, oh I'm just having a warm fuzzy.'
Five.
Buffy, don't... don't start thinking of me as your friend.  It interferes with the work, and it...
As for example, what?
I kind of had to improvise.  Sorry about your guitar.
I'm pretty much learning not to accept anything anymore.  Come on, Merrick.  Football.  Afterwards we can kill and kill until there is nothing left.
He knows who I am!
You got a C-plus?  I can't believe I cheated off you.
They don't even have Dolby.
That's the plan.
Cassandra's really smart.
Sorry.
Got that.
No --
Well, I hope so.
Snapped.  Buffy was, you know, on the upswing, and I swear to God she went across the room.  Perm over heels.
Does Jeffrey know?
Pike isn't a name.  It's a fish.
Like we don't have rights too?
Right!
Oh, please!  When she ran onto the field in the middle of the game? Was that the most out-of-it thing ever, or did I blink?
As long as there's room for three in it.  What, didn't you bring your new friends?
You should think about leaving, too, man.  Sell this place... Something's going on here.  I don't know.  Something real weird.
I don't think so.
If I throw too hard I'll hurt the kid.
Much better.  Your delivery was fully integrated because you weren't thinking about it 'cause you were pissed off at me.  This is progress.
It's all the same thing.
Y'know, Annie, I been thinking if it works for one game, maybe it'll work for a whole buncha games.
Sure.  Unsnap my stockings.
What a nasty thing to say.
Of course I'm seducing you for Godsakes, and I'm doing a damn poor job of it--  Aren't I pretty?
Don't worry.
Why do you get to choose?  Why don't I get to choose?
What do you believe in?
When you're hitting you shouldn't think about anything but hitting.  But you shouldn't think about it too much.  The trick is to use your brain to not use your brain.
What'you see in that guy--he's dim, pretty boy.  a young, wild,
Why not?  If you hit twenty homers this year you'll be the all time minor league champ!  The record's
You got me all confused.
I'm not a real batter.  I'm a woman.
Nuke won't go to bed with you, eh?
I want to be had.
He won't make love to me anymore.
I don't imagine there's much I could teach you.
Crash, I get wet just thinking about you.
Well...I used to think that wasn't the worst thing in the world to look forward to.  Lately I'm not so sure.
Whatta you mean "why not"?  Are you gonna play forever?!
Yeah...you a witch?
You'd be great, just great...  'Cause you understand non-linear thinking even though it seems like baseball is a linear game 'cause of the lines and the box scores an'  all--but the fact is that there's a spacious-"non-time kind of time" to it...
He'll learn.
You got a live arm there.
You need a nickname.
Which one of us?
You're a regular nuclear meltdown, honey--slow down.
Shake off the pitch.  Throw what you wanta.
Why's he always call me "Meat"? I'm the guy driving a Porsche.
Well, I held it like an egg.
I'm having a blast.  God, that sucker teed off on it just like he knew I was gonna throw a fastball.
How?
You been in the Majors?
I just wanta play everyday despite small nagging injuries--and go home to a woman who appreciates how full of crap I truly am.
Go for it.
If he had a good breaking ball, I'd respect the shit outta him.
I know, I know--I have that dream all the time.  We're almost home.
Yep.  He really crushed that dinger, didn't he.  Musta gone 450 feet...damn...
It's time you started working on your interviews.
I don't need a crazy woman in my life.
'Cause of Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.  The Big Club's got a hundred grand in him-
And where can I go?
Love to--
C'mon, Meat.  You can't hit me 'cause you're starting to think about it already, you're starting to think how embarrassing it'll be to miss, how all these people would laugh.  C'mon, Rook--show me that million dollar arm 'cause I'm getting a good idea about the five cent head--
We'll be praying for you.
It's a league record.
Even if it's the Carolina League-- this is a chance to play everyday.
...and one helluva guy.
Some kid hittin' .300 in Lynchburg ...probably a bust.
Looking for Crash Davis.
I'm Nuke LaLoosh.  With the Bulls.
Hello, Senator.
Good to see ya.  William would you...
I was in the building!
Philip, if you would rise.
It's a pity in this...
All right, take care.
Hello.
Right away.
Yeah, sure I do. Why?
I can't! I'm tied!
I don't know.
Eight.
Honey, come here.
Me? That's why the bosses sent me out here. They wanted me to make sure none of the other crews robbed the joint. Like these two fuckin' balloon-heads over here [EDDY and JERRY]. They were gonna try and bang us out of two hundred fuckin' grand?  Yeah, right, I'm sure.
Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place.
No.
Then he called me a faggot.
Okay.
Between...
Yeah, I believe it. You got banned.
Forget it. You can't even set foot in the parking lot. That's how serious it is.
Hey.
What're you doin'? He's a square guy, for chrissakes.  You can't treat him like that. He's gonna run to the FBI.
Well, back home they don't know about fuckin' control. That looks bad.
What the fuck happened to you? Will you tell me?
A week ago it was my business, now it's none of my business. In other words, when you need me to take care of somethin' for you, then you need me.
What people?
I don't even know what you're talkin' about, Nick.
I didn't do anything. I mean, I didn't order you or anybody...  I only told Andy Stone that you had a lot of heat on you, and that was a problem.
You never - ?
I don't know. What am I gonna do with this woman? I don't know...  She's drivin' me fuckin' crazy.
She's driving me fuckin' crazy.
It's me.
Yeah, I heard a lot about you.
You bet.
Well, that's why they paid so well.
Seven o'clock.
They were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where it happened.
...as soon as Andy got back home, Nicky heard about our talk in the car.
Yeah, refill'd be great.
...all you do is give me answers. Just - just give me the right answer.
...And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room...
I wouldn't give the bum a mop job.
Certainly.  Senator.
What is it?
Ginger's mission in life was money.
See you, Ginger.
She was a queen around the casino. She brought in high rollers and helped them spread around a lot of money.
I hit a few... uh, games on the way back.
Thanks a lot.
We're not getting any younger. Don't you think it's time? Aren't you gettin' tired of all this shit? Bangin' around, hustlin' around?
I know I'd be a good father. I know you'd be a good mother.
Yeah, I know all that.
You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm gonna do even better. And so, whatever happens, if it doesn't work out between us, I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life. And if there are kids, especially, you know, I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine.
Just what I said. You'll be set up for the rest of your life. That I can promise you.  Want to take a chance?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Need a little help with that, Mr Collins?
Look - Sam, I've been independent my whole life. I never had to ask anybody for anything. Now you're making me beg you for this.
You can trust me.
Look - for my ulcer, I take a half a one of these, a half a one of these. And that's when I have extreme pain. I had a three-month supply. What'd you do with 'em?
I don't need one.
No, you don't.
Yeah, and I get a sprained fuckin' elbow.
Hi, it's me.  Just who you wanted to talk to, right?
What do you mean?
Yeah, yeah, I got the rest.
But even if you bought him a watch, a really nice watch, one that he thought was nice - and he doesn't know what the fuck a good watch is - so, you go, five, ten, twelve grand?
Would you knock it off, Sam?
There's nothin' to figure out. I'm home... we're workin' it out.
No kidding. NO KIDDING!
Fuck you!
And don't send your guys down there to stop me! I mean it.
What did Jennifer have?
Who were you with?
I should have -
You understand? What? Let you go?
I wouldn't do that...
Get the fu-  You threatening me?  I'll fuckin' kill you in this place!  Get up and go home right now.
You're gonna be sorry if you don't stop that.
I'm not -
Good evening, everyone, I'm Paige Novodor.  What should have been a routine licensing hearing turned into bedlam yesterday when the flamboyant Tangiers Casino executive, Sam
Mr Rothstein.
What are they doin' way back there? Bring 'em up here where they belong. You can't even see 'em over there.
These are our best machines. They bring all the action. No wonder the drop is off.
Listen to me very carefully. There are three ways of doing things around here. The right way, the wrong way, and the way I do it. You understand?
Well, it happened so quick. Three guys won. I didn't have a chance to call you.
Well, there's no way to determine that, Sam.
Well, it's a casino. People gotta win sometimes.
You're firin' me?
I'll regret it even more if I keep you on.
I'm just curious. I saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand. Can you do that with both hands?
Can't do it with both hands?
Mm.
Mm.
You call yourself a man? You know you're a lyin', low-life, motherfuckin' gambling degenerate prick? You know that's what you are? Two small kids at home. I gave you money to pay the fuckin' rent and buy groceries, put the heat on. You know your wife called Frankie and told him the fuckin' heat's off?
Thanks, Nick.
Well, you gotta understand, I'm giving you fifty thousand cash.
Hi. Good.
What're you gonna do? Strong-arm me?
Please.
Hey!
She's on the account. There's nothing we can do.
Yeah?
Ace got my son, little Nicky, involved with Little League, and it was great.
...metro intelligence cop. But it didn't matter. I mean, it was all about the kids, you know.
He tries to do everything...
Yeah. Fuck him.
Why, does it look like it's bothering me? What do I give a fuck?  Fuckin' Oscar too. All the fuckin' money I've given that prick, he don't even look over here. What's his problem?
Carmine left?
Well, listen, uh... Good luck with the joint, huh? 
Stay out of the way!
Yeah, I heard, yeah.
I'm positive.  Remo... things are very fucked up down there, you know?
Pleasure.  Very nice to meet you.
Okay, Sammy.
It's all right.
I'll be there.
I don't - 
Yeah?
Yeah. 'Cause, you know,  He's never gonna give me my jewelry.
I did what you told me to.
Sure did.
Come on, come on, you're a toughie. You can take this.  Don't cry.
It's what you want?
I don't need you! I have my own fuckin' money!
But I saw something...
Thank you. Very nice.
What's the matter?
What money? I've seen you stealing from me.
Ginger, I've been watching you all night. You've been stealing from me.
That bag's full of fuckin' chips you
It means I got the money.
Here.
She started it. She started the whole thing. I'm just standin' here.
All right.
Don't look at me, pal. I gotta live with her.
All right.
Two.
Hey. This is Shelly.
Stacy. 
It's up to you.
Let's get out of here.
Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say?
Yeah, what'd you tell him?
Dominick said they're in the motel?
Ch-Charlie M!
Charlie M.
What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought you was layin'.
No, I want to have this marked, Mr. -
Mr. Chairman -
I didn't curse. I said 'frickin' head'.
I'm sorry.
I can't take this no more. Back and forth, back and forth.
You are right. What can I...
Having a good time?
Sorry, sir. The Cult is my life and my life is the Cult. By God, Captain God, I shall not fail you..
Crowd always buys it. What do we got?
Guilty. I am.
There's a nice cafe down the street...unless you're afraid of this Catwoman prowling around. We can always dine at the mansion, if..
What little boy doesn't...  My God...it's, it's...Catwoman.
Your warehouse?  Go on ahead--to your "warehouse." I'll be okay...
At some sanctimonious celebration of condescension. Nothing like appeasing half the population with a two hour luncheon.
Uh Brock, today you are without me...
You're telling the truth. I can tell..How did this..
A couple that battles the forces of evil together is a couple that stays together.  Thank you, Jeff.
She has a real spirit.
Yes, did you call us here for any particular reason?
Your uniform, that first time I saw you, was a ghastly cage I vowed to unlock in order to..
Oh come on, Cactus, be a man!  The blimp is still on schedule, right?
I've been thinking. I've been thinking about us. I'm sorry I've been so hard no you these past couple days. I realize now it's because you're the only woman who ever understood me and I couldn't handle it!  I've never revealed myself to anyone the way I have to you. Let's blow this town together.  We'll run a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont by day, and by night, we'll dress up and kill anything that...
You were right all along--the two parts to a person are the reality and the lie.  I was making good money as a top architect--but that's not who I am. I'm not an architect, I'm a..
Ooh, I've read about this philly. She's the one who gave that wimp Batman all those migraines up in Gotham...
Resting Up?  Sorry Spooky, I've got to go with God on this one. I hate to think we're just in this for the money.  Garfield's girlfriend crossed a line last night and she's got to get spayed. We're going out of Oasisburg on a win.
I'll put that in the report--after you shoot her.
And...your point?
Do you have any idea how much superheroes get paid?  Zilcho. Urban vigilantes with secret identities operating outside the law. Not exactly the stuff of a W-2 form.  If it wasn't for merchandising and corruption and these diabolical "missions"...There is no such thing as heroes and villains, anymore, Selina.  There are only winners and losers. You lost. We won.
The Mission is happening tonight..It's up to you to...to save the City...
What is it with women and Catwoman? Men have the courtesy to punish the weak, but women love punishing the strong. Don't get me wrong--this Catwoman is a terrifying, subversive menace to everything this community stands for and she must be stopped. It's just, I like her a lot.
I'm not through. This will come as a shock. Again, to one of you. I am Catwoman. The Catwoman.
We have to do something. What can we do to help, Selina?
Do I hear a woman's voice?
Taking messages.
I'm not finished.  Under other circumstances I'd gladly go out of my way.  I don't understand why you just don't phone some other person.
Then whose is it?
You got it wrong.  I'm the one that's on your side.
Yes sir.
Can you make him stop!
I want the gun emptied.  I want to see all six slugs tossed up here. And then I want out.  That's all. <u>OUT</u>!
I'll see that he stays calm.  Pack the money up and put it in the trunk.
Not this minute.
Wait!  I hear her breathing now. There, she just picked it up again.
<u>You're</u> doing all the talk.
What am I supposed to do?
Will you let me explain!
I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry to do this to you.
You won't disconnect.
Elliot -- our driver.  The officer put his gun to the back of Elliot's head and -- fired.  It was so quick.
Shit!
Even if I got there first she wouldn't go with me.
Forget about us.  Just save Rachel.
Why didn't you do what your friends wanted and just -- get rid of me?
Pictures.
That makes two of us.
I've lost you.  You're gone.  I can't hear anything.
That's not her.
No.
When Jack sees they've got Rachel HE'LL tell them what they want to know.
Even if you found us -- what then?
Don't talk.  Don't talk!
Jack hasn't loved me for years. And now I'm afraid she's turning out to be like him.  So cold and distant.  I've let him make her like that.
I'm sorry.  You've thought this out better than I ever could.  I'm ready now.
Just start walking.  Come on. Walk to me.
She'll be with you soon.  They're pulling up.  They'll realize I kept my part of the bargain.
They tortured us.  And you're going to let them have all that money?
Why are you telling him that.  Are you crazy?
There isn't any such person.
Jack Oberfeld in person.  Did you kill him?
He seems to think he's entitled to it all.
A typical fuck-up.
Plus names, addresses and I.D. for the lot of you.  We're in this together and I need to know who my partners are.  In case I ever need to roll over on somebody.
That's why we're turning off onto a fire road.
The money, Nels ... ?
I had it in my mind what you'd look like.  "Her," I could've painted.  <u>You</u>, I'd be afraid to turn my back to mix the colors.
Why are we stopping?
Take your hand out of there. Slowly.
Toss them -- one at a time.  I don't want to lose count.
I don't want it.
You're up on your details, aren't you?
Tell the lady to relax.  Tell her I can't wait to meet her in person.
Stay there.
You already tried to pull one little number on me -- and it didn't work.
Thanks for the sound advice.  Now ask the woman to get out of the van and walk over here.  Alone.
You pull up -- collect your first installment.  Then you let the daughter go.  When she reaches me, I'll dump out another third.  Same action.  I back up again -- you pull forward.  Satisfy yourself it's there.  Then we do it one last time.  The final exchange. And we go our separate ways.
Are you trying to panic the women?
She's yours.  What are we waiting on?
If you're looking for a quickie all you've got to do is ask.
And if you ditch us we get zilch.
And I end up in a fucking neck brace for life!
Nels!  Guess who?  A friendly voice from beyond the grave.
I thought you'd know me by now.
You could always disappear with what's already in your backpack.
Take the 405 south.
Five minutes.
Stay put!  I know my way around.
Them.  They won't be expecting us.
Nobody can do anything right but you!
If you weren't going for a spare what were you doing?
Was I picking on you?  How come you pulled in back of this fruitstand?
There's no lady here.
Let her tell you.
Government business?
Undercover.
Your partners are currently armed and we're not.  Our edge is that they don't know we're in touch.
She wants to know, sir, do you like your hair.
What do you think his name is?
Who the fuck is he?
Fucking mad!
Fuck off, Dave.
Consider it how you like. Just get that bloody tart out of here.
Not in my experience.
Guy I work with.
Like treacle.
Must be.
Yes, thank you.
Must be.
How special?
Whiskey.
Jesus fucking Christ.
How different?
Maybe.
What do you think?
You say that like a gentleman.
Like you're concerned.
I am.
He did sometimes.
Something I heard someone say once.
If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.
All the time.
Where?
What you doing here?
Don't call me that.
Never said a truer word.
Do you care, Jimmy?
Make it up to me, then.
I can't.
I promise.
What?
For me.
Jimmy?
You knew which man?
He asked me to see were you all right.
I like you, Dil --
More what?
Whatever you say, Dil.
Yeah.
Never.
Fergus.
It's my name, Dil --
Carnations.
Fucking do. I had him all over me.
No, what is the thing?
Jesus, Fergus, you're a walking cliche. You know we won't leave her out of this. But I'm glad to see you care.
Get that thing off me, Fergus --
He described me down to a T. Knows what Jude looks like.
I'm a volunteer, am n't I?
And who's Dave when he's at home?
No. It's the truth.
So I've noticed.
They're going to let that guy die. And you're going to kill me.
And you know the funny thing?
You fuckers set me up. That bitch --
My pleasure, Jody
Tree.
Hurry up, would you?
Shut up, would you?
What do you believe in?
Present tense, please. Love her. Whatever she is. I'm thinking of her now, Fergus. Will you think of her too?
How can I?
I don't want to sleep. Tell me something.
A story.
Me? No, I'm not good for much...
The fastest.
Cricket's in the halfpenny place.
You won't run.
You didn't?
Tell me, Jody
Who gives a fuck.
Thought you liked me, bitch.
First her husband, now her -- she hoodwinked you! She batted all them big eyes and you went 'n fell for it - like a egg from a tall chicken! Here!  You want? Here -- it's yours!
Is there a Mrs. Canfield?
I think that's what you ordered.
Don't you know I'm having a tough time keeping my eyes off of you?
What about it?
Well -- come on.
I've looked, Adam -- you know I have --
To the apartment -- it matches mine perfectly.
No -- last time I said "I love you, Alex."
With whom? Where?
Stop grousing. If we find the money I'll buy you an international conference all your own. Now start looking. You take this side and I'll poke around over there.
I'm through listening to you!
You lied to me so many times --
Here, give it to me.
Mr. Bartholomew -- are you sure you know who I am?
I don't suppose it's an airline, is it?
May I have a sandwich, please?
Stop calling me that! Lampert's the name on the marriage license.
Thanks very much.
But --
Well, there you are! Charles had the money with him -- so whoever killed him has it -- they have it!
Like I said, Mrs Lampert -- I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger. Remember what happened to Charles.
You mean he might have -- Mr. Bartholomew, I'm catching the next plane out of here -- I'm not going to sit here and wait for someone to make chopped liver out of me!
Who?
What does your Mr. Dyle look like, Mrs. Lampert?
Yes. The five men. They were, of course, your husband, Charles, the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday, and Carson Dyle. But something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact. It must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money.
But if they stole all that money -- why can't you arrest them?
I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew, but nothing you've told me has changed my mind. I still intend leaving Paris -- tonight.
Well, if I'm going to die, I might as well do it for my country.
But no one actually saw him die.
None whatsoever. Please, Mrs. Lampert -- be careful.
Yes, I'm leaving now -- goodbye.
Herman Scobie. And you've never seen him before, either?
Yes.
You'll wreck your raincoat.
Okay -- up there.
Open it.
It's all right with us --
I'll take that.
I'm no easier to live with than he was.
Oh. Well, then he's a truthful Whitefoot, of course.
Reggie -- listen to me --
Cutting it out.
Whoever it is won't give up -- and neither will I.
I'd better call Sylvie -- she must be frantic.
Scobie -- he's the one that objected.
I'm sorry.
I'm scared.
What makes you think that this somebody will be satisfied with three? He wants it all, Alex -- that means we're in his way, too.
First your brother, then Charles, now Scobie -- we've got to do something! Any minute now we could be assassinated! Would you do anything like that?
Let me know what you want -- I'll pick a suit that matches.
Have you ever heard of anyone taking a shower with his shoes on?  What a nut.
But then if we sit back and wait, the field should start narrowing down, shouldn't it? Whoever's left alive at the end will pretty well have sewn up the nomination, wouldn't you say so?
I can't very well leave without a pair of water wings.
What do you mean?
Adam Canfield. Wonderful. Do you realize you've had three names in the past two days? I don't even know who I'm talking to any more.
The man who bought them last week was American. I did not see him but I heard. I knew you would come.
I'm -- I'm sorry -- I don't know anything about stamps.
What's its value today?
No. For a few minutes they were mine -- that is enough.
And then some. If you'd only told us you was goin' to her room we could've kept 'em busy --
And if it is?
You know I'd tell you if I had it.
Stop it!
But his mother --
I wish you wouldn't.
A letter? May I see it?
And this? And this?
In Mr. Dyle's room?
I know. I would bury it in the garden.
Oh.  Neither do I.  Voilà!
I found it! I found it!
No, Jean-Louis.
The one you're blocking. This is the last chance I have -- I'm flying back to Paris this afternoon. What's your name?
No, it isn't. I'm getting a divorce.
Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said: "When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again"?
Try and get my old job back at UNESCO, I suppose.
Don't you understand French?
Starting tonight?
Lay on, MacDuff.
I -- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tell you or not.
He said if I told anybody it could prove fatal for them as well as me.
That's what I'm not supposed to say.
Where?
Then stop acting like one. If you're really in some kind of trouble, I'd like to hear about it. Otherwise, it's late, I'm tired and I'm going home to bed.
Good night.
I think I sprained my pride.  Where'd he go?
A quarter of a million dollars.
That's all.
That's all right -- it's a drip-dry.
How do you know what they're doing?
At least he knows how to behave at funerals.
Until two days ago all I really knew about Charles was his name -- now it turns out I didn't even know that.
Hello, Reggie -- I am waiting for Jean-Louis.
He feels terrible about those things he said to you in school.
Can I come in? I'll need to use the phone.
As fucking if.
That's an awful lot for ten minutes of beasting?
I get the imports.
The kids adore him. They confide in him. His patchouli reeking rear might know if Stacy and Rod were really virgins. Why didn't you ask Jody that?
Had either of them broken up with someone recently? Hurt someone?
Run!
The same type that decides to carve into her stomach.
No. I'll handle this.
She's still a virgin.
I'm looking for Lisa Sherman.
I never met the woman. I'm just taking care of the place until they sell it.

Can you just follow me? The back is full?
I don't watch him eat everyday.
You could tell him you really liked the way he chews with his back molars.
You're the one always saying 'Just do it'.
You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
No.
So? You're already late. A few more minutes won't matter.
Did Sharon say no?
I do not.
I'll think about it.
I can't believe I listened to one word of his shit.
So I should feel happy that he got away with it?
Yeah.
That's not why we broke up.
What?
I love you.
Hi princess.
Yeah. Who is she?
I overheard daddy mentioning her to someone. I he thinks she's the killer.
The library. I'll be fine.
Who is she?
How could you?
The men. Do any of them still live around here?
Who was the fourth?
Not a day has gone by where your father has not torn himself to shreds for what happened. We both have...
I'm Kenny's Aunt Lisa.
Yes. He asked me to come over and talk to you.
There's going to be very few virgins left in school on Monday. It could be really dangerous for them if the killer isn't caught.
Hi Sandy.
No, you keep one.
Told you to hide it.
What?
If sheep don't count.
You're being unfair.
Yes. Unfair to me.
Okay, okay.
EXT. ROAD - DAY.
Oh...
No argument there.
Hey, I'm with you on that one, my man. Prick.
Except for the fact that I need cash.
...two things Andy is not.  Uh, but I tell you what.
That'll make up the difference, huh?
Peace.
I got, like, uh....
Hey, you're gonna piss me--  What the hell are you supposed to be...
I'm gonna stomp your a--

Suppose you're gonna shoot me because you can't get service on my cell phone.
No, you gotta go to McGrud-...
To get to McGruder, you have to go through Missoula, and I ain't goin' to Missoula.
Borrowed.
You're nuts, goin' back there!

Oh...
All right.
Okay.
...gun?!
Hi--!  The gun was empty!

You can just bend over and kiss your crazy ass goodbye, buddy! 
Hey, hey!  Whoo!  Okay.
...Pete!  Come on.
Come on, old...
...you crazy bastard.
 I made it.
You okay?
Holy--!

...man!
Oh, shit.
Okay.  Okay.
You know.
Started every game my senior year.  Not all-American or anything, but not bad. Anyway, the real star was my best friend, the quarterback.  Got taken in the first round.
...for whatever it's worth, I'm sorry I dragged you into this...
...shit.

Are you all right?
Huh?
We're gonna die!
Okay.  All right, man.  Okay.


What?

...they come!
What do you think I'm doin'?!
 
 What's it say? 
We got-...
Hold this. 
Arlo, I'm gonna get Elvis.  You go.
They aren't exactly gonna publicize this,  Arlo. 
Who had to put a gun to your head?
I'll handle this from here, sweet   Owes us a little restitution.
What about all that "no need to get in the man's...
Look.  That's negotiating? He threatened to kill...
That's bullshit.
Yeah.

Yeah.
 big balls.
That was quick.
...within five minutes.
Oh, my God.
Three seconds.  One...
And it won't be pleasant. 
Hey!
So...where's my truck?
We do need your truck.
I had no idea how powerful it was.
...-lem too?
What the hell's a sage?
He's the dude...
 ...Mason.  I can barely hear you.
Thank you.
...and selfless actions, you did save millions of lives.
However, you are also non-en-...

Is it--?

I don't work for you, Captain Brynner.
This isn't some kind of pissing contest, Long.  You may be in charge here, but those men out there are my responsi-...
...sittin' here with our hands in the goddamn cookie jar!  And let me tell you something else.  I didn't join the service to let people like you turn...
It's too...
Do you think I haven't seen the bodies of those...
So far, ye-yes.
Pleasant surprise.

Land sales out of escrow are always recorded within the week.
It doesn't hurt.
No. She happens to think the last one was murdered.
Tell me. What do the police say?
Who's the investigating officer?
His girlfriend?
When was the last time?
My daughter.
How did you find out?
Yes... I think I can manage...
Call me Jake. How is everything?
Curly, where's your car?
I don't know...
I said okay, Jake.
Give us things. Not just some old flag like this, but –-
How'd you get past the guards?
I get by.
You're welcome to try. There he is.
No?
You mean that's what you're going to call it.
Oh yeah? Can you think of something to charge me with?
How did she...  ...happen to have them?
I don't think I need a day or two. You're even dumber than you think I think you are. Not only that, I'd never extort a nickel out of my worst enemy, that's where I draw the line, Escobar.
Let her go. She didn't kill anybody.
Jake, you're very disturbed. You're crazy. That's her father.
Of course.
A private investigator?
Anyway... I... the point is, Mrs. Mulwray.  I'm not in business to be loved, but I am in business, and believe me, whoever set up your husband, set me up. L.A.'s a small town, people talk.
Suppose they did. How does it concern you?
A check?
Mr. Gittes...  Don't tell me how I feel.
He told you?
Why?
Where you were when your husband died.
You mean you don't know where you were?
Been meaning to talk to you about that.
Yes, of course. It was quite a while after. I was just out of grade school when they did that.
Oh.
Not over me. Why would they have a falling out over me?
Yes. He never forgave him for it.
Before this I turned on the faucet, it came out hot and cold, I didn't think there was a thing to it.
No, I think I'd remember.
No question from you is innocent, Mr. Gittes.
Doing what?
I thought I was keeping someone from being hurt and actually I ended up making sure they were hurt.
It has to do with my father.
He owns it. You know?
Including the death of your husband?
I am not!
Aren't you coming back with me?
Sure.
Where's the girl?
What are you doing? What's wrong? I told you we've got a 4:30.
What the hell is this all about?
What are you saying?
I don't know what you're talking about. This is the most insane... the craziest thing I ever...
She's my sister and my daughter!
...so that's why you hate him...
I have to go home and get my things.
With us.
Okay...
But, Mr. Gittes.
What'd you expect? That's his job.
When did you come in?
Ida Sessions.
And Mulwray isn't?
Hope so. He's working for us.
Neither do I, actually. But you hired me or you hired that chippie to hire me.
Well, look at it this way, Mr. Yelburton.  Mulwray didn't want to build a dam and he had a reputation that was hard to get around, so. you decided to ruin it. Then he found out that you were dumping water every night. Then he was drowned.
Well, Whitey Mehrholtz over at the Times will. Dumping thousands of gallons of water down the toilet in the middle of a drought.  That's news.
Yeah, a little runoff. Where are those orchards?
Yes...
Yes?
Yeah, got dead drunk, passed out in the bottom of the riverbed.
Now, what makes you certain he is involved with someone?
Money doesn't matter to me, Mr. Gittes.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'll do that.
May I ask what this is regarding?
I take a long lunch. All day sometimes.
Along with Mr. Mulwray.
I don't know. The traffic was pretty loud. I only heard one thing – apple core.
Look, you tell me to take pictures, I take pictures.
Yeah. What's wrong with you guys? Think ahead. We find 'em, sue 'em. We'll make a killing.  We'll have dinner at Chasen's twice a week, we'll be pissing on ice the rest of our lives.
Jake, it's Chinatown. They're all over the place. You oughta know better.
Toto, come here.
Then why don't you want to teach it to me too? Now that there's no more cranking, and it's easier?
Alfredo, go fuck yourself!!! 
OK. OK. But now that I've got a job, I'11 probably stop going...
Progress! It always arrives too late!
That's right, Modern Times.
They tell me you never go out, never talk to anybody. Why?
Yeah!...Getting there's downhill and all the saints help you. But coming back! The saints stand there watching you, that's all! God's will be done.
That's nothing to do with it, it's the car that's still being run in...
I got back today. You can't imagine the excuses I had to make up to be here...
Good, this way we can finally talk. I'll convince him this time.
Who?
One or two. Bur there're not all that many Salvatores.  I've got a son, too...he's older. And you, do you have children?
Alfredo, damn him! He cast his spell on you too!
He wasn't crazy. In the beginning I was upset. I think I really hated him. But then, with time, I understood what he said...and your silence too.
And I never asked for one! You have nothing to explain. I always thought that what you did was right, and that was that. With no beating around the bush...  Only one thing made me suffer: bolting the door shut before going to bed at night...
The food is marvelous in Cuba the senoritas are beautiful stop I could send you prose poems of palm trees and sunrises and tropical colors blending in far off landscapes but don't feel right in spending your money for this stop there's no war in Cuba regards Wheeler.
What does it say there?
Thais.
I can't take shorthand.
You don't really think so?
That's a long story.
And the social.  How about the music notice?  You got that in?
Enthusiastic?
-  We thought maybe, if we can find out what he meant by that last word - as he was dying -
He made an awful lot of money.
In case you'd like to know, Mr. Bernstein, he's at the Huntington Memorial Hospital on 180th Street.
Yes.
I'm all right, Mr. Leland.  Only there was some fellows out front that thought they ought to take things up with me.  I learned 'em! Didn't I, officer?
Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein.  There doesn't seem to be an serious injury.
I don't my plans myself.
How do you do, Mr. Bernstein?
That's one of the things I think must be changed, Mr. Carter.  The news goes on for twenty-four hours a day.
Charles!  Your - your breaking this man's neck -  would scarcely explain this note -  Serious consequences for Mr. Kane -  for myself, and for my son.  What does this note mean, Miss -
Why should anyone vote for him? He's made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them. Children - to be told one thing one day, something else the next, as the whim seizes him.  And they're supposed to be grateful and love and adore him - because he sees to it that they get cheap ice and only pay a nickel in the street cars.
Maybe I should have - the first time he showed me what a mad dog he really was.
He's paying for it, Emily.  Those returns tonight - he's finished. Politically -  - socially, everywhere, I guess. I don't know about the papers, but -
It may not be about anything at all.
I'm not interested in the voters of this state right now.  I am interested in - well, Junior, for one thing.
Too late for what?  Too late for you and this -  this public thief to take the love of the people of this state away from me?  Well, you won't do it, I tell you.  You won't do it!
Rogers, I don't think I will postpone doing something about you until I'm elected.  To start with, I'll break your neck.
Thanks.
In the water.
On the chiffonier.  Here.
But you like me, don't you?  Even though you don't know who I am?
And I know too many people.  Obviously, we're both lonely.  Would you like to know where I was going tonight - when you ran into me and ruined my Sunday clothes?
I was only joking!  This evening I was on my way to the Western Manhattan Warehouses - in search of my youth.
I want to be a singer.  I mean, I didn't.  Mother did for me.
Oh, no!  Nothing like that.  Mother always thought - she used to talk about Grand Opera for me.  Imagine! An American girl, for one thing - and then my voice isn't really that kind anyway, it's just that Mother - you know what mothers are like.
As a matter of fact, I do sing a little.
As far as you're concerned, Susan, I've never wanted anything -  I don't want anything now - except what you want.
Susan!
Susan, it seems to me -
You can't stop me.
Susan, don't go!  Susan, please!
I'm going to be elected governor. And the first thing I'm going to do -
Get out!  I've got nothing to talk to you about.  If you want to see me, have the Warden write me a letter.
I think we'll have to send our friend Wheeler a cable, Mr. Bernstein.  Of course, we'll have to make it shorter than his, because he's working on an expense account and we're not.  Let me see -  Mike!
Yes, sir.
All right.
Yes, sir -
Our readers are, anyway, I don't know about the rest of the country.
Why not?  Well - nobody's a great man in your estimation until he's dead.
Charlie!
I don't have to.  I run a newspaper with half a million readers and they're getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast. I can't help that.  Besides, they all know I'm married to his niece.  I've got to think of her.
She's going to leave you -
She was going to leave you anyway -
Why is she leaving me?
The personal note is all there is to it.  It's all there ever is to it.  It's all there every is to anything!  Stupidity in our government, complacency and self-satisfaction and unwillingness to believe that anything done by a certain class of people can be wrong - you can't fight those things impersonally. They're not impersonal crimes against people.  They're being done by actual persons - with actual names and positions and - the right of the American people to own their own country is not an academic issue, Brad, that you debate - and then the judges retire to return a verdict and the winners give a dinner for the losers.
Yes.
Hello, Charlie -  I didn't know we were speaking.
What do you mean by that?
Mr. Leland sent back that check.
You made it out to him last week after he left for Chicago.
It is.  Go on, Mr. Thatcher -
You won't be lonely, Charles...
Never mind -  Bernstein told you about the first days at the office, didn't he?  Well, Charlie was a bad newspaper man even then.  He entertained his readers, but he never told them the truth.
He knows the first Mrs. Kane socially -  That's the answer we got.
We will assume full management of the Colorado Lode - of which you, Mrs. Kane, are the sole owner.
Right here, Mrs. Kane.
But don't you think if we release it now - he's only been dead four days - it might be better than if -
We're leaving tonight.  As soon as they're through photographing the stuff -
Millions - if anybody wants it.
I had a toothache.
I feel kind of sorry for him, all the same -
I'll have a highball.
I'm not from a newspaper exactly, I -
She'll snap out of it.  Why, until he died, she'd just as soon talk about Mr. Kane as about anybody.  Sooner.
Rosebud?
What is this, a poll?
What the hell is that?
You're shittin' me.
It's cheaper than cigarettes. And it certainly beats this.
It's a picture of a cancer-ridden lung. Keep it.
This? How long have you been smoking?
How long have you been a smoker?
No, I think I'll drink it in here, thanks.
Okay. I'm sorry about that.
You want me to leave? Why? Because somebody is telling it like it is? Somebody's giving these fine people a wake-up call?!
What better place than this? To stamp it out, you gotta start at the source!
No, this is great.
You two better quit it.
Just now.
I want to talk to you about something, and I don't want to be disturbed.
Very dramatic, I thought.
What, it's worse? You're pregnant with an Asian design major's child?
You could've broke it to me gently, you know; at least started by telling me you had a boyfriend. I told you I have a girlfriend.
How like her.
Yeah, but not seriously. Christ, you're ready to walk down the aisle- I'd say that constitutes something more than just seeing somebody.
Sang? His name is a past tense?
I just believe in giving credit where credit is due. And I believe that I'm the impetus behind your failure to wed.
We could introduce them. They might hit it off.
Give me a bit more credit. I think it's time we got back together, you know. I'm more mature, you're more mature, you're finishing college, I'm already in the job market...
So... what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating?
I hear that's a rather popular date.
Sang.
He's your fiancé.
So what are you saying?
I'm just kidding.
I'll ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back.
He went to rent a movie, but he hasn't gotten back yet. Ah, screw it; I'll just lock the store up and leave him a note.
What happened to the walk and the nakedness?
Um... okay.
It wasn't me.
I'm not fooling around!  Who went back there?
Yeah.
In a second!
I'll assess all I want!
Give me a stick, pretty boy! I'll knock your fucking teeth out and pass all over your ass.
Yes.
Sir! Sir, I'm sorry! He didn't mean it! He was trying to get me.
I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund your cigarette money, and we'll call it even.
Annoying Customer.
Why are the shutters closed?
Shit, if I'd known you were working, I would've come even later.
You called Caitlin again?
Chick only made you nuts. She cheated on you how many times?
She called you Brad?
That's not cheating. People say crazy shit during sex. One time, I called this girl "Mom."
What do you mean?
Chess team Allan Harris?!
Oh yeah.
You think things would be any different now?
Which did you like better: Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back.
Blasphemy.
Then wouldn't that logically mean that it's a theocracy? If the head of the Empire is a priest of some sort, then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion.
Hence, the Empire was a fascist theocracy, and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution.
There's more?
Yeah.
This guy is going through all of the eggs. Look.
I'll give him five more minutes then I'm calling the cops. I don't need this, man. I'm not even supposed to be here today.
You know how much money the average jizz-mopper make per hour?
All of them.
Smokey Three: thumbs up, am I right?
Can you believe this?!
I don't back down.
You know what pisses me off the most?
I can't believe I'm going to miss the game!
You've got a customer.
At least let me maintain some semblance of managerial control here.
Gatorade.
Exactly. They drank it all.
"It's not like we're gonna sell out."
Embolism in her brain. Yesterday.
You've had sex with a dead person.
I'm not missing what's probably going to be the social event of the season.
If you go, I go.
Balls resting on his lips.
Yeah, but at what a price.
What, your dick?
Listen to you.
If title dictated my behavior, as a clerk serving the public, I wouldn't be allowed to spit a mouthful of water at that guy. But I did, so my point is that people dictate their own behavior. Hence, even though I'm a clerk in this video store, I choose to go rent videos at Big Choice.  Agreed?
I got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor.
Five hundred dollars.
She's not going to marry that guy. She went home to tell her mother.
This is my way of spitting water at life.
I told her that. She said she didn't need any. Why don't you join her, man. Make a little bathroom bam-bam.
Shut the fuck up!
I should shit or get off the pot.
What are you talking about?
Leave me alone.
I can't, all right! Jesus, would you leave me alone? I can't make changes like that in my life. If I could, I would-but I don't have the ability to risk comfortable situations on the big money and the fabulous prizes.
My mother told me once that when I as three, my potty lid was closed, and instead of lifting it, I chose to shit my pants.
Why do I say that?  Randal... forget it.
What don't you do?  Randal, sometimes it seems like the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable.
What time did you get to work today?
Unless you're out renting videos at other video stores.
I'm not dealing.
Done poisoning the youth for the day?
Nothing personal.
A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax.
I jacked the car up. All she did was loosen the nuts and put the tire on.
She's my girlfriend.
I'm sure he wasn't sleeping.
No; he was probably just resting his eyes.
Actually, that's his night job.
If you'll just tell me the title of your rental choice, I'll have him hold it for you.
I'm not asking about the color. I mean is it rough or cottony?
Aw, c'mon boy. What's the difference? You said yourself the stuff that's there now is rough.
Can I trouble you for one of those magazines?
No, I mean the ones there. Behind the counter.
Uh, can I have the other one. The one below this one. They show more in that one.
Too hard?! I don't have enough indignities in my life-people start throwing cigarettes at me!
I'm only here until twelve, then I'm gone. The boss is coming in.
I had to use shoe polish to make that sign. The smell won't come off.
A girl makes a guy cum, it's standard. A guy makes a girl cum, it's talent.
I touched a nerve.
It wasn't directed at you. I was making a broad generalization.
Three.
I am. And that's why you should feel like a pig. You men make me sick. You'll sleep with anything that says yes.
I want you to come with me on Monday.
Unlike you, I have a class in forty- five minutes.
I'm sorry, Dante. I thought you understood.
All right! Shut up a second and I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked.
Um. Thirty-seven.
I'm going to class.
...And one of those guys was you! The last one, I might add, which-if you're too stupid to comprehend- means that I've been faithful to you since we met! All the other guys I went with before I met you, so, if you want to have a complex about it, go ahead!  But don't look at me like I'm the town whore, because you were plenty busy yourself, before you met me!
I love you. Don't feel sick.
At least he wasn't thirty-six.
Randal...?
WHAT?
According to the NJAC-the New Jersey Administrative Code, section eighteen, five, slash twelve point five-a fine of no less than two hundred and fifty dollars is to be leveled against any person reported selling cigarettes to a minor.
An angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at Quick Stop Convenience sold her five-year-old daughter cigarettes today at around four o'clock. Division of taxation calls the State Board of Health, and they send me down here to issue a fine. You say you were working all day, hence the fine is yours.  It's doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child.
Scumbag. What are you doing?
He knows some English, but he can't not speak it good like we do.
That's sick, Dante.
No, I wasn't.
You're gonna be at John K's party?
You're not?
He didn't ask me to...
You're kidding. It's almost eleven- thirty!
I'll bet you twenty bucks you don't get to rent that tape.
Ronnie! How are you? You work here now?
So...what are you, blind, son? This is a banana eating a monkey, nature in reverse.
It can't fly in this weather.
A bad climb, no, just another challenge.  What's life without 'em, right, Agent Travers.
Hey, anything for a friend. How's the knee?
Hey, fuck you.
When we get this group down, I'm gone.
You keep it.  Get up there if you can, and if you get a chance, do me a favor and kill him.
Sure you can.
One...
Nice and easy...
We spent a night there one night...
Working...I'm trying to figure out where to start.
It doesn't matter, anywhere but here.
I only came back for you.
What are you doing here!?
How'd you get up here?
You got to go back now!
You attacked me.
I've gone this far, and right now I think I'm in better shape than you.
No, not really.  Throw down a rope.
Up ahead.
Hold on!  Hold on!  Reach up!
I won't do it.  No way.
Good memory.  You must be great with numbers.
Never could save a thing.
We're not animals, but don't force us to be.  Walk over.
What are you talking about?
Anyone else following?
Who the hell ever is.  This is the most protected shipment we've got-- and the most useless. These bills aren't even <u>in</u> circulation; the one thousand dollar bills we're transporting are only used for international banking exchange.
What the hell are you waiting for, goddammit!  Don't you see what he's doing!  He's hijacking the shipment!
On my way.  The cases are hooked up and ready.
Kill him when he gets down.
We can't and he knows it.
What about it?
He can't be far away.  Find him. Go!
You dumb bastard, you waited too long.  If he made it back, this place would have been covered with police in a few hours.  The way we're moving, it's going to be anyway.
Primed to go off right over his head, officer.
I haven't lost a bill in eighteen years, don't jinx me, Walt.
We should be.  Everybody wants what we have.
We've been working hard too. Takes glass.
There was some sophistos from the TV studios around the corner, laughing an govoreeting. The Devotchka was smecking away, and not caring about the wicked world one bit. Then the disc on the stereo twanged off and out, and in the short silence before the next one came on, she suddenly came with a burst of singing, and it was like for a moment, O my brothers, some great bird had flown into the milkbar and I felt all the malenky little hairs on my plott standing endwise, athe shivers crawling up like slow malenky lizards and then down again. Because I knew what she sang. It was a bit from the glorious 9th, by Ludwig van. Dim makes a lip-trump followed by a dog howl, followed by two fingers pronging twice in the air, followed by a clowny guffaw. Alex brings his stick down smartly on Dim's legs.
A nozh scrap any time you say. Dim weakens.
I just don't get this all. It was them that went for me, brothers. You're not on their side and can't be. You can't be Dim. It was someone we fillied with back in the old days... Trying to get his own malenky bit of revenge after all this time. You remember, Dim?
Try the wine!
Won't you join me, sir?
Who are they, sir?
I'm frightfully sorry. There is a telephone in the Public House about a mile down the road. I suggest you use that.
Hahaha, and how are you feeling now?
Well, as I've said, we've heard about you. We are interested in your case. We want to help you.
But first we'd like to find out a few things about you.
Alright, Mum... have a nice day at the factory.
Sorry, Em, I wanted it to be like... a big surprise for you and pee.
A cup of the old chai, sir?
You try to frighten me, sir, admit so, sir. This is some new form of torture. Say it, brother, sir.
Appy polly loggies. I had something of a pain in the gulliver so had to sleep. I was not awakened when I gave orders for awakening.
Oh, the old moloko-plus first, would you not say
Was I alright, sir? Did I do well, sir?
Hi, hi, hi there, my little droogies.
We always help our friends, don't we?  It is no secret that the Government has lost a lot of popularity because of you, my boy. There are some that think that at the next election we shall be out. The press has chosen to take a very unfavourable view of what we tried to do.
Keeping fit then?
Oh well, he met with like an accident. He passed away. Alex becomes a bit weepy.
Sorry, brother. I didn't mean any offence.
Why did you do that, brother? I've never done wrong to you.
... and this... He pulls Alex's nose.
No, sir.
Through there for a bath.
How're you feeling this morning?
We're going to friends now, sir.
Yes!!!
Oh.
Bollocks. You know what you can do with that watch? You can stick it up your arse. Slide of nude woman in bed, a man at the window.
I'm sure it won't be long now.
Yes!!!
But, Sir... Missus... I see that it's wrong! It's wrong because it's like against like society. It's wrong because everybody has the right to live and be happy without being tolchocked and knifed.
You certainly have not, 655321. You've been very helpful, and you've shown a genuine desire to reform.
The question is weather or not this technique really makes a man good. Goodness comes from within. Goodness is chosen. When a man cannot chose, he ceases to be a man.
Well, like he says, it's mostly odd things he does, helping like... here and there, as it might be.
We've only just read about it in the morning papers.
Four in this block, sir.
Sixth, you got delivery trucks blocking traffic at Herald Square. Look, I make this trip all the time.
Bottega.
How often you go?
He's...what?  Say again?  We're in cell hell...
In my office?
Max, I'm scared.  Are you sure?
You're kidding me.
Most vividly.  "St. Louis Blues," "Potato Head Blues," "Sleepy Time Down South..."  ...then Pops laid some "Cornet Chop Suey" on me, and left me in the dust like a whipped dog.
The crowd was most kind.  I was born in 1945, but my life began the night of July 22, 1964.  That was the moment of my conception.  Right here in this very room.
'Fraid so.
I am a nice guy, Daniel.  With a job to do.  You know how it is.
I never lie.  Ask Max.  Max, have I lied yet?
I said.  Get the gun.  Out.  Of my fucking <u>face.</u> Before I wrap it in a blintz and feed it to you.
Tell me.  Has Black Peter already crossed off a few bad children?
Months now.  He's been feeding me information on Dmitri.
Not our call, Phil.
Oh, call me Ida.  To what do we owe the pleasure?
Tell my son.  You have to hold a gun to his head to get him to come see me.
Try?
I've been calling and calling.
I'll fuck you up, you don't hand it over.
...show me the wallet, man, get your ass up, <u>up</u>...
Max!  Dammit!  <u>Answer!</u>
...well, last I checked, you were <u>sleeping</u> with me, so unless you wanna start fucking the guy soon, I'd suggest an attitude shift...
Two minutes to get on Broadway. They're doing some roadwork around the bridge.  Eleven to get downtown.  Four to the Lower East Side.  Six to clear the roadwork.  One minute margin for error.  My math says twenty-four.
An apology.
You share it with over three million people every day.  You know that's the population of New Zealand?  What's Manhattan, thirteen miles long? That's a lot of misery crammed into thirteen miles.  Read about this one guy.  Gets on the subway and dies.  Six hours he's riding around before anybody notices. Think about that.  Here's this corpse doing laps around Manhattan courtesy of the New York transit system, people getting on and off, sitting next to him, and still nobody catches on. Three million.  That's too damn many people.
Yeah.  I share it with the dayshift guy.
Me, specifically?
I don't talk about it, you know...  No offense.
You always stutter?
With what?
I don't think I can do this.
Yeah.
Two...
What?
It's a mess.
Tonight it is.
Play music.
What'd he do to you?
How can you kill him like that?
Lenny, my dispatcher.
I need the job.
Tell him next time he pulls any shit, you're gonna kick his fat ass.
What?
I don't understand...
I'm...what?  Sorry?
I never learned jazz.
I'm done.  Find another cab.
Oh, I'm captivated.
You'd do her a favor.
Jazz.
What happened?
It's not bullshit.
I've always been good.  Ever since I started.  Gave up piano.  Easy money. I'm putting a stake together, get something started.  Go figure it all out...
In case <u>who</u> checks?
Dmitri?
He's gonna <u>shoot</u> me?
We've both run out of options.  If it helps, take comfort in knowing you never had a choice.
Why?
No.
Makes two of us.
Tribeca, near the waterfront, northeast corner.  Twelve minutes.
I only owe you a ride, Vincent.
That cop!  Why'd you have to do that?  You couldn't wound him?  The guy had a family, maybe, parents, kids who gotta grow up without a dad, he was probably a good guy; and he believed me...
That's what you said...
Man, if someone had a gun to your head and said:  "You gotta tell me what's goin' on with that person over there or I'll kill you"...they'd have to kill you...  'Cause you don't have a clue for...or about...anyone...  To be like that, I don't think you, you have any of that for your own life...  Do you believe you're entitled or at least expect to draw breath in the a.m.?  Open your eyes in the morning?  I don't think you do...I don't think so...  I think you are way <u>low</u>...like in your estimation.  In your estimation of yourself.  So how'd you get that way...?
What are you gonna do, pull the trigger?  Kill us?  Go ahead, man! <u>Shoot</u>...my ass.
Geronimo?
The guy came right at us!
Sorry, Flip.  Got sidetracked.
Shut the hell up.
I can't promise you anything.
I think you're different.
Switch the charts.
Sure.  You switched the charts, didn't you?
You expect me to believe what, that someone came in here last night.  Gave that guy... something that stopped his heart?
As opposed to?
You mean I should speed up and try and lose them?
Six months.  Eleven days.
Do they have a secret handshake?
I'm not sure.  I think I figured something out.  It must've been in my newsletter.
You're certifiable.
Um, coffee.  If that's okay?
I've been reading up on it.
Who?
Getting rid of my hub!
You watch me, don't you?
Where'd you get your subscribers?
Well, I've been tracking them down all morning.
There are all kinds of groups, all kinds of initials.  But they're all part of two warring factions. One:  families that have held wealth for centuries. They want one thing.  Stability. Group Two:  the boat rockers. Eisenhower's military industrial complex.  They want instability. It's a trillion dollar a year business.  When there isn't a hot war, they make a cold one.
So now they feed us terrorists. <u>To create fear</u>.  How much do you think an airport security system goes for?  Then multiply it by every airport in the country.
His obituary was in every paper. But not one of them said he was murdered.
They're big details, Jerry.
Okay, I will.
Holes?  I don't know what you're talking about.
There's a car following us. Probably another one flanking us the next street over.
What's in Connecticut?
How come serial killers have two names, but lone gunman assassins have three.  John <u>Wilkes</u> Booth. Mark <u>David</u> Chapman.  Lee <u>Harvey</u> Oswald.
Reagan didn't die.  If he had died, everybody would know what Johnny's middle name was.
Did you kill my father?
No...!  But they trained me to. M.K. ULTRA.  EX-CATCHER.  America works.  Get rid of the crazy people, the lone gunmen, and the system still works.
Yeah.  I know what it's like.
Because he believed me.
Your father, he was dying.  He was worried about you.  He took your picture out to look at it.  He called you his baby.
Now she tells me.
Could you be a little more specific?
<u>Liza</u>!
That's ironic.  Because we're here to protect her from you.
Well, I don't know if --
I'm leaning toward no.
I don't know...
Fine.  What the hell is going on?
Terminal?
And what did I say?
You do recognize it then?
Working.
Look, you're a nice guy, but I'm not really dating right now.
Tell me about it.
What do you mean?
And Jonas?
Ellie?
What?
I don't know.  Ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
Okay, fine, they've got the primes -- but if you're right about there being another more significant transmission still to come --
I'm willing to take that risk.
What if you're wrong?  No -- I'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence -- you can't deny the possibility -- and I believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly... profound is worth investigation -- and worth taking a few risks.
It's not enough having my search time systematically cut down -- you know I'm down to three hours a week now.
You can't just pull the plug, David.
Meaning...
David --
What?  Why?
We've cracked it.  Lunacharsky found it.
You were right, Ellie.  You were right all along.
Ellie.
Ellie... you should know that I'm no longer the President's Science Advisor.
Good luck, David.
How soon will you be able to decode it?
Analyzing signal polarization shifts.
Kent, Kent for Chrissakes.  You must be Eleanor.
1919+21.  Found a glitch in the timing; probably a starquake.
Thank you, Mr. Sensitive.  I'm coming at this wrong... missing something... something...
It's a civilian facility.
And a hundred mile airspace.
Is that your official response?
Okay.
Oh, we didn't build it.  The transit system has been in place for billions of years; we're just its... caretakers.
We don't know.  Whoever they were, they were gone long before we ever got here.
But -- other people from our planet should see what I've seen -- they should witness this for themselves.
Very good, Doctor.  I've also detected structural elements, back references, a general movement from the simple to the complex -- all of which would seem to indicate instructions -- an enormously complicated set of instructions -- for building something.
That would seem to be the question of the hour.  I want to build it, Doctor.  Of course I'm already lobbying through the usual channels of influence and corruption -- but as I said, my colorful past has made many of those channels... difficult to navigate. I need someone on the inside.
It's so... small.
Japanese squid fleet.  They use lights to attract them to the surface... then turn them into sushi.
It's beautiful but it does get a little lonely.  Sometimes I think the reason we build these things in such godforsaken places isn't to avoid excess radio traffic but because we're all such pathetic antisocial misfits... Speaking of which:  How're you getting on with the old man?
And?
Actually --
'The work,' Jesus, Ellie, can't there just once be more to life than the work?  Okay, maybe that's the only way to get the recognition, win the prizes --
Peter.
It's really happening.
Wait -- hold on a minute --
Only a tiny bit.  Even the most devout believer is allowed a little doubt.
You may not believe this... but there's a part of me that wants more than anything to believe in your God.  To believe that we're all here for a purpose, that all this... means something.  But it's because that part of me wants it so badly that I'm so stubborn about making sure it isn't just self-delusion. Of course I want to know God if there is one... but it has to be real.  Unless I have proof how can I be sure?
If you came back.
I don't consider you the enemy, Ellie.  I'm not 'out to get' technology.  I only ask the question:  Does it have to have all the answers?  I look out there and I see so much emptiness... People are so starved for meaning, and it's something they just don't seem to be getting from science.
An excellent question, Doctor.  But what if we don't like the answer?
The final countdown.
I'm sorry -- I can't --
Don't you understand?  I just have to hold it together -- just until tomorrow --
It was quite a page turner.
It also makes God enormous.  I think of the scope of your universe, Ellie... and it takes my breath away.  As it will everyone else's.
How would you propose we handle it, Doctor?
But --
Helen, she sent along your things with a note, and John here, he wrote to the police.
Sometimes I wisht people was like dogs, Luke. Comes a time, a day like, when the bitch just don't recognize her pups no more, so she don't have no hopes nor love to bring her pain. She just don't give a damn. They let you smoke?
We allus thought you was strong enough to carry it. Was we wrong?
What are you doin' here?
Yeah. Did you have them both at once or --
I... I... I...
Yes, Boss. I got it right.
Yes, Boss.
Says here you done real good in the war: Silver Star, Bronze Star, couple Purple Hearts. Sergeant! Little time in stockades. Come out the same way you went in: Buck Private.
Well, you got yourself some time now. Two years. Hell, that ain't much, we got coupla men here doin' twenty spots. We got one who's got all of it. We got all kinds and you gonna fit in real good. Course in case you git rabbit in your blood and decide to take off fer home, you git a bonus a some time and couple leg chains to keep you slowed down a little -- fer your own good. You'll learn the rules. It's all up to you. I can be a good guy or I can be one mean son-of-a-bitch, it's up to you.
Ah believe I smell me a blonde-haired lady.
Pair'a nines.
He's eatin' steak and corn with butter and green beans and...
Mah baby! We're diggin' and dyin' but our boy Luke is lovin' and flyin'.
A cold drink? You mean one cold drink? To feast yore starvin' fishy l'il eyes on The Picture? A true vision of Paradise itself? With two of the angels right there in plain sight a- friskin' round with mah boy?
Well --- okay. It's a deal. One cold drink, if'n you please. In advance. One chilly bottle right here in mah hot l'il hand... That goes for the rest of you mullet-heads, too.
I didn't say nothin', Boss.
I just always did like truck rides.
Back at it in the mornin'. Just need a little nap...
Yeah, those poor old guards need all the help they can get.
I thought you knew, boy... they sentenced me by the mile.
Nothin' to worry about. We got a deadlock on that mullet.
We ain't goin' nowhere.
On my own.
He's the champeen hog-gut of this camp. Hell, I seen him eat ten choc'lat bars and seven cold drinks in fifteen minutes. He kin eat busted bottles and rusty nails, any damn thing. If you'd so kindly oblige as to let me cut off your yankee head, he'd even eat that.
That fool. That damn fool.
No more than five. For a cold drink.
Bears gonna be walkin' the road today.
Cuter.
All the bears gonna be walking today.
That's all there was. Listen. Open your eyes. Stop beatin' it. And stop feedin' off me. Now get out of the way. Give me some air.
But you're dog enough. Maybe they'll let you sleep outside the box near your master.
None of your fucking business.
Are you kidding?  You buy enough gourmet junk every week... most of which <u>rots</u>... to garage a fleet of stretch limos.
A little heavy breathing is what most of us yearn for.  <u>Forget</u> it.
No, dear.  You're at your best with a bag in front of your face.
Reminded me that I used to be attractive.  That men used to want me...
Without question?  He only scored 40 percent, four out of ten criteria?  Couldn't another expert say he <u>flunked</u> the sexual sadist test?  What curve are you marking on, Doctor?
What first two murders.  We don't know about them here, do we?
You get me out first.
Damn!  I gave that to Conrad, too! That guy!  I told Conrad deliver to Kurten and keep the 500 bucks in return for getting my book to you.
Where are you, Peter?
You know where.
Is he out?
You don't admire me.  No police admire me.  I got one of you killed.  Why don't you say right out what you're here for?
If you knew why, you might know where to look for him. I don't envy you this; he's not done -- he's going to do them faster and faster to keep the adrenaline rush.  Now, I've done what you asked me.
Look at the sign.  'Hell'?  In the Festival of Love?  You make any sense in that?
Have you got a warrant?  Get the hell out o here!  This is the <u>only space I have left in the</u> <u>world</u>!  Why can't you leave me out of it?
Ah, if you knew that, you'd be half way to nailing him.  Serial killing is irrational and rigid and compulsive.  This guy has a plan all thought out, flexible and complex.  He's playing a game with us.  Who will he imitate next? Maybe he's doing all the serial killers in history, the great innovators, the murderers' hall of fame.  Just to prove he's better than all of them.  They got caught; he didn't.
You betrayed me!  Now every psychopath in the city knows I'm back in business... You lied to me!
He said to send you his regards and to tell you that the Bureau holds you in the highest esteem.
You're exhausted.  Let me get you a brandy.
What does it matter?  This guy, you checked your course records, who signed up?
I've got to go.  I've <u>got</u> to go.
W-We had a fight.  I called him... called him a name...
They never kill themselves.  How do you know it was him.  You never met him.  You never even saw a photograph...
Daryll Lee Cullum?  I don't think so.  If he's escaped we'd have the National Guard, cops'd be crawling through sewers.  You'd have a guard on your front door.
Let me get a little action started here.
Is there a phone booth there?
They taught me at the FBI.  I was very good at it.  It scared me... I liked it.
He wants me, he doesn't care about her.  Let me...
Over here.
She is a writer, writing best selling books about serial killing. Giving lectures she's well-paid for.  Her interests are not the interests of law enforcement.
We've put a tap on Dr. Hudson's phone.  I know you won't mention it.
You got that right, Nikko, it's none of your business.
Yeah, you did that too.  You earned what you got; don't shit on it, that's all I'm saying.
I'm sure she thinks it is.  Aren't you at least interested in which one it is?
You came in there with this attitude...
You're right.  I can't stand that bastard.  Sorry.  This is something new.  Not the same guy, that's for sure.
Excuse me?  <u>Excuse me</u>?!  What do you...
Good.
Yessir.  I have reflected on that, sir.  Which explains my gushing deference to you, sir.
You're damn right I do.
Give him <u>that</u>pompous son of a bitch.
I gotta have Ruben, and a...
So I'm maybe gonna lose three good cops?  You fucked up on this occasion, but don't be so hard on yourself.  There's something I want you to think about.  The book says if you use your gun, use it to kill, that's what it's meant to do. You tried to pick this punk off with fancy shooting, to keep him alive.  To what end?  You're not willing to kill, you can't be a cop.  Go get drunk.  I am.
Don't give me six years!  You never divorced Patty, did you?  So what'd you expect from M.J.?
Then you shoulda known she wasn't buying.  She was just long-term leasing' you.  Ah, Nickie.  Except for that rare twenty-second twitch, there ain't nothin' about sex I don't hate. But of course, I'm Irish.  Plus I got <u>real</u> problems.  I'm worried I might have to put you in over M.J.  There's something going on here, the Commissioner is targeting her now, I can't leave a woman in that position.  But the thing is, how can I move <u>you</u> in, if you go on acting like a teenage asshole?
No. What about your camera girl? Did she come?
Well, yes.  You're getting out of bed tomorrow. They want you to walk.
And her husband? What was he?
He's very pale. Covered with scars.
At home. I couldn't face all this traffic.
James.
When I first met Vaughan, he was a specialist in international computerized traffic systems. I don't know what he is now.
Yes. I didn't plan it that way.
No, thanks. I'll go with Vaughan.
Yes.
I live in my car. This is my workshop.
I think in the spirit of group therapy, it's beneficial for each of us to open ourselves up to the others.
Go ahead and put the guard back up, Letty. But you need to know what you're dealing with.
Mom won't miss your wedding. She'll come around. I promise she will.
Please, Letty.
I'd have to see it on.
What about the engagement party?
Paul, can you hand me the olives? Ruth, I need you to, what was it?
What's the matter?
Mom and I fought for 20 minutes over whether we should go with ecru invitations or brilliant white.
Ecru.
Do you want to go see him? I'll take you if you want to go.
I'll be running it three days a week, and...
Come on.
No, not yet. But you know Paul. He's sure to get it.
Paul could pop the question at any time.
Mom, I was there, and I just, I was so... They didn't have the olives, and I, I got so upset. I don't know how it happened.
But what about Beast?   Who'll...?
You too, Mom.
Just think, pretty soon, we'll be doing all these wedding preparations for you.  Of course, if that's what you still want. Ruthie told me some silly story about a crush on some boy here.
Not even if it's something positive?
There's a spider in my room.
Letty.
Is this really important? Because I don't think it's a problem.
Finally. I was getting tired of watching him try every night.
So are you engaged, or what?
The left one.
Good God.
And I'm not covering for you when you sneak out to call Dominos.
No rounds for another three hours.
Back-to-back sessions with the shrink.
Really?    Me too.
Wow.    I'm bad news.
What are the delusions like?
I'm starting to think that everyone's crazy to some extent.
No way.
Throw pillows, Letty. The sales lady said they're the latest thing.
Out? Are you kidding?     I've got all the fixings here.
Thanks.
You got wine. That's great.
I think you know I'd love you even more in a blue polyester cap.
Congratulations.
You don't have to know all this by Saturday. It took me years.
I saw you talking to my Mom.
Michael, calm down. Please. It's OK.
I guess so.
Someone has to take care of you right now, Michael. You tore up the apartment. You stopped taking your medications.
Well then why'd it happen?
What do you want to do?
How about something better?   Like a kiss.
In there's better.  It's kind of romantic, don't you think?
I mean tonight.
I'm sorry.  I'm just...I'm so tired lately.
That's a big question.
Something you did?
No...
I heard your friend was back in the hospital.
Sure, I understand.
I'm glad you're doing well.
I'll float you.
Shhh. They're coming to the cubic zirconium.
Do you know who this is?
They don't have a murder weapon?
Then we just have to make sure everyone who knows can't say anything.
Where did they go?
I'm your worst fuckin' nightmare. Now, if you don't want me to keep on hurting you, it's important that I believe you and right now I don't. So tell me, where did they go?
I'm taking a vocabulary course to enhance my communication skills.
And nothing.     He's just feeling us out.
Nah, that's just Tony's way of telling me Judge Judy starts in ten minutes. You ever watch it?
Some cash. Jewelry. The other stuff I can replace, but there's a cardboard box... photos of my mother. They're the only ones I have of her.
You want me to help you get out of the country?
How about if I call you?
Thank you.
Where are you from?
No one? Then why is Zero here?
What about the money?
And the Vodka.
And be careful when you get near the top. Zero has a very long one.
I think he's already figured that out.
We all agreed to it. You had no way of knowing Bastaldi was setting us up.
Maybe if we gave the tapes back --
Good. Zero and Julien will go in through the window and disable the motion detector. The rest of us will come in through the front door.
You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. But these tapes. He's never going to stop looking for us.
I think he'd cut his dick off if Bastaldi told him to.
Has to be.
Even if we get out of town and go to another airport I'm sure the FBI and Chicago P.D. has alerted customs.
You haven't answered my question.
Man, I can get anything.
I ain't bullshittin'. I can get guns. I can get any kind of gun you want. But they ain't gonna help your sorry ass. You ain't been in town one day and already you got two of the toughest people in Chicago looking for you. How is that possible?
How much?
-- Don't think. Okay?        You're not good at it.
French guys?    You mean like from France?
Everything?
Well, I must say you're handling it very well.
Dead bodies. The ones in the Lincoln are your... associates.
I see.   A master criminal.
Hey, it's not your picture on the TV, it's mine. So, try to be cool.
She took everything!    Didn't even leave us cab fare.
Yeah, I can see that.
Me?
God, I want to go home.
The baseball is mine.
No!
Yeah.   It's mine.
Yeah, I dig him.
I know where she went.
Cool.
Where is it, Sophie?
I'm more of a whiskey drinker myself.
We don't know that for sure.
Tonight.
Just lucky I guess. How'd you start working for the Bastaldi's?
Something like that.
After last night I could say the same for you.
I don't know. Sell it. It's gotta be worth something. Someone gave it to me. C'mon Frankie, I'm trying to make good here.
Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.
Wait!  I'm a friend!
Why were you spying on the Yus?
Then leave her to me.
I do as I please.
Then tell me where Jade Fox is.
That's a risk I'm willing to take. Deep down, you're good.  Even Jade Fox couldn't corrupt you.
I'm just playing around.
If I hadn't seen you fight with Li Mu Bai, I'd still be ignorant of all you've hidden from me.
Don't bother.
So what if I don't?
He is my defeated foe!
I heard you met Shu Lien today.
I have a guest.
The handle is heavy.  And the blade is no ordinary metal.  Still, the sword is the lightest of weapons. You're just not used to handling it.
Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.
You're probably right.
I'll write your name.  Just for fun.
She used Purple Yin... Purple Yin poison.  It goes straight to the heart.
Jen!
With all the traffic on your rooftop these days... it took me a while to get in here.  I can't wait any longer.  I was wrong to let you go.  Come back with me.  You'll be happy in the desert.  You'll be free there.
Give it back!
Jen...
"A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
Perhaps.
Have you questioned him yet?
But your men are watching over Yu's compund?
I don't know it was stolen until I got here.
Well, we had talked...
She's out there, but I doubt she'll show herself.  We'll keep our eyes open.  Sooner or later, she'll come for the girl.
Not everything is an illusion.  My hand... wasn't that real?
Not a bad idea.  Tonight we'll get a good night's sleep at headquarters.
My life is departing.  I've only one breath left.
I doubt it.  This thief... it very unusual...
Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his warrior days... maybe he's trying to tell you something?
This is a delicate matter.
Don't any of your little pals have real, grown up names?
Was. ALBRECHT  This isn't Top Dollar's style anyway.  This was somebody else. Somebody new.
Who ever made that.
I'm buying.
You gonna wind up working at a school crosswalk.   that doughnut's chocolate you, know.
Don't thank me.
I saw it, too.
I should be trying to stop you.
No.
She's still dead.
I need to find him kind of soon, Elly.
Five large, in the drawer right over there.  I never saw you.
Another jolly nickname?
A whole club of pirates, with pirate names...
Yes.
Leave me alone -- !
Tell me I'll get hurt.  That I might die.  I've already done that.  I don't need anyone's help.  Yours included.
I'm already alone.
Very well, it's your ass.
No.  I saw a guitar.  This isn't some rock-n-roller you forgot to pay, is it?  There was a drawing on the wall that looked like a bird.  In blood.
This is a cobra, Mr. Grange.  Yes, it is real.
Is he inside?
One of mine.  And it wasn't a standard hit.
Nice speech.  What's it supposed to mean?
Annette Harrison.
That's right.
I'll be fine.
Look, I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel like I can't go on I...  turn to Jesus and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but -
You what?
Not a whole lot. We take some classes together. He's got a bad rep, but it's mostly bullshit.
Well, a lot of people are jealous cause he's loaded.
On my mother's life.
What'cha reading?
Great book.
That's a matter of opinion.
What? Another letter from your friend?
No, it's okay. I mean I look at you with all your morals and values and well, YOU seem to be happy in your choices. I envy you. No bullshit.
Seriously, you're amazing. You have everything going for you.  You're smart, you're beautiful, you're determined. You're everything I want in a girlfriend.
Fine. Friends it is. I can live with that.
It's my house.
I wish I could say the same for myself. I was up thinking about you all night.
I'm trying to better myself, but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away.
Well try this one on for size. I think I'm falling in love with you.
Without question.
What?
Well, I was just calling to see how you're doing.
How was your date?
What are you doing?
Yeah, it's pretty relevant considering my situation.
You? Volunteer? I don't think so.
Oh please.
"I actually feel good about myself?"
I do not.
You are very pretty. I would like to kiss you.
Oh please Annette. You spend all your time preaching about waiting for love. Well here it is. Right in front of you, but you're going to turn your back on it. I'm sorry that we're not at the age where we can get married. If we were, I'd propose, but that's not going to happen. So I guess we're just fucked. I'll move on, but you... you're going to have to live with yourself knowing you've turned your back on love. And that makes you a hypocrite.
Hi.
You don't even know me. The fact of the matter is there is some one I love. She's smarter, prettier... you don't even compare to her. The only reason I am here is because she wants us to be exclusive.
Schwarz. Jewish?
- none taken -
Where did you say she's from?
Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field.
Cecile, is that the best you can do?  You must forgive her, Kathryn. She's never been in a co-educational atmosphere before.
Well hurry up. I want to be at Mrs. Rosemond's before lunch.
It's Kathryn.
It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.
I did?
I am?
I'm what you would call a fifth year senior.
You promised to let me kiss you.
Is it me?
No.
Let me tell you something, doctor. Chicks love a guy with a bad rap. They say they don't, but they don't mean it. They all think that they're the ones that are going to "save me." The trick is to let them think it's true.
It works a little.
You do?
Yummy.
I told you to lock the door.
Did you do everything I asked you to?
Who is this?
I told you I don't know.
But I can't even see her. She doesn't have her own phone, I don't even know her e-mail address.
Hopefully, though she suspects that your decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the maid.
Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy. "But I thought high school was only four years." I mean, please. She knows nothing. She's seen nothing. I could have her under the table at Au Bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. Go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. I have a reputation to uphold.
What makes you think I'd go for that bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar car.
Even there?
Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love that.
What's your plan of attack?
I hate it too.
I'm aware.
Yeah.
She's really getting to you, isn't she?
Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a ride?
Where is she?
Kind of.
It was... it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part.
Excuse me?
Then do me a favor and get rid of her. If not for me, then do it for you. Look at yourself. You're a joke. She's turned you into jelly. What do you want to be, one of those losers who walk down the halls holding hands and smiling. People used to respect you. They feared you and now you're going to throw that all away.
I've never done this before.
Not my choice of toast, but it's your call. To your triumph over Annette.
Will you calm down?
And if I don't?
I'll do my best.
Like your step-brother Sebastian. I can't believe they didn't expel him after what he did to the school nurse.
I hope I didn't keep you from something.
It's Cecile.
You will be discreet about this?
Oh please. I can't have you do that.
I'll do that.
Do you know where she is?
Do you know when she'll be back?
We played backgammon?
Nope.
I can't have you do that, nor can I have you hanging around the lobby all day.
It seems that you and I have some talking to do.
Kathryn? Oh Christ, she got to you too?
Ronald, you don't know what you're talking about.
I'd love to.
Hello. I just met Amy and she pointed out where you live.
Yes,  She's a little odd, I understand.
How?
I can make wishes like this come true.  I'll be just like Daddy wants me to be -- play with the other children -- not sit around by myself — tell the truth --
That's what I wished on. Edward says it's a wishing ring -- and it is!
Wouldn't it be just the same, darling, if daddy dropped the present at Mrs. Farren's on his way to town tomorrow morning?
All right, Amy.  Go tell Edward to take you.
That's why I can tell you, straight out, you think too much about Irena -- blame yourself for her death.  And its your thinking and brooding about her that makes you so unnaturally concerned about Amy.
I forgot I had it on.
No kids yet.  Something's gone wrong. Maybe I ought to call somebody.
Well, it seemed to me --
What?
I suppose so.
That darn kid. I never in my life expected her to get an A in arithmetic. Math's is a practical science --- if she understands figures, she's well out of her own world of make-believe.
We've got to go on.  Amy, here, all this time, you've let your mother and father think you had forgotten that old dream life of yours. Now we find you've only kept it secret.
She said something about that, Mrs. Reed — but she didn't tell me it was the Farren house. I'll get my other hat and coat and go over there.
But you told me in the garden-- that the wish about the tree couldn't come true.
This one says, "To Mother from Amy."
Yes, darling.
I'm your friend.
I can not tell you.
For as long as you'll let me.
Yes, yes! I see Prince,
Oh, please!
Yes, Amy.
That's a fine-looking ring.
Maybe, if it's a real mourning ring like we have in Jamaica. All you got to do is turn it on your finger, close your eyes, and make a wish.
I'm trying to.
I do suppose so. But if you were there yesterday, guess you can get there today.
Stranger? Julia Farren a stranger. Why I've played every theatre from Boston to San Francisco. I've been to London and Paris. Those days — those beautiful, shilling, golden days.
A Christmas present. It's been so long since I've had a Christmas present.
No, not people -- just deer and game, but the people he catches can never be free again. They too must kill and kill, covering themselves with blood.
Yes, yes -
Gray. They were a lovely, lovely gray.
Yes. Yes, Barbara, I shan't forget.
I-shan't see her. No, Barbara, no.
I'll not see her, Barbara. I promise.
Now, I don't know Amy --
Little miss, you can't stay here. You've got to come with me.
Yes, everything's all right, Edward.
I like to see her happy.
We'll see that she gets there in good time
At Victoria's Secret.
No, it was another woman.
Good. Except for PMS.
I get a little bloated sometimes.
What a bitch. You should see a doctor. That can be dangerous. George bit me once and I had to go to the emergency room.
Holy shit, I'm a freak.
I don't remember. We kissed at my door and next thing I knew I woke up with my period. Alone.
I think I went in and fell asleep. I guess Gregory walked home and got killed! I blacked out.
Rule one: always wear make-up.
Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over.
You're at his place, and you come out of the bathroom looking all shy and say, "I'm so embarrassed but could you run out and get me some tampons?" If he says no, he's too embarrassed, then you know he's a wus. If he says he's got some in the bathroom, then you know there are other women around a lot. But if he says yes and goes to get you tampons, well then he's a decent guy. Then, while he's out...
It took me an hour to clean it up. That was not in my head!
I think I turned into a werewolf and killed him.
No.
So are you. Look, go about your life. Act like nothing's wrong. We'll get to the bottom of this.
Check out what I found.
Great so all I have to do is fall in love? Like I haven't tried that for the past 24 years.
Who is this Madame Sconce? Let's find her and talk to her.
I think I already have.
Remember what Madame Sconce said. If you love him he'll be fine.
About Mark? Carlton?
Sorry -- I shouldn't go on about myself at a time like this. Are you sure you're going to be okay?
They say sex is great for cramps.
I really gotta pee.
So pee? Here?
Since when do you care?
You never say that.
Yeah right... You better go.
You haven't even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me!
It's Mark.
This really isn't a good time.
You think that story's gonna make me loan you money?
On your desk.
Your desk.
Yes, that's what we're looking for.
I'm trying to stay away from caffeine.
No really, I love knowing what people read.
Sometimes it's frustrating. Like this Gregory Jameson case. We don't even know what killed him. I'm putting together little details to see if we're missing something.
Yeah but a guy hung like a horse would need briefs to keep things in line.
Me neither. That's why I wear briefs... So why did you and... Mark break up?
NO! I... I checked when I put my stuff in. I always look through the washer first.
Mark wouldn't hurt a fly.
They're for my cat. I use them to train him not to rip up paper.
Frida? You okay? Look, I think I know what happened to Mark. I want to help. I'm coming over.
Yes or no? Frida, can't you just be honest with me?
Can't you bite me and then I'll be like you?
I'm so sorry... I... I couldn't help it. You know I didn't mean to... to do any of that.
Let's explore this. What makes you feel you're a werewolf?
And how did you feel when you ate this guy?
We didn't have sex.
Yeah and when we're mad at each other we're out of sync. It only works if you're on good terms.
Yeah, sorry. Uh... Gregory's roommate told us you were out with him last night.
You're some catch Lloyd.
She was never a suspect Lloyd. Some animal must have done this.
And you think I'm sick?
And he was missing an arm.
Okay Lloyd, you tell me how she killed them.
The park dude was missing an arm.
Which brings up an interesting point. I wasn't following you. I was following the suspect. And you just happened to be there...
Says he is the man's doctor...  You know...
Just visiting my patient.
Yes, of course.  Everything's fine...
Just like that?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Inspector.  Have patience  - you'll see for yourself.
Yes.  This way.
Germs, sir.  These places are full of them.
I woke up in a subway.  I don't know how I got there.
Who?
What?
Wait, this isn't fair...
Then we must call the police.
Asks my name.  Over and over.  Just like a broken record.  Only thing is, I can't answer.  I've no idea what my name <u>is</u>.
You're supposed to be my doctor, right?
I'm nothing then.
Maybe.
Don't ask stupid questions.  Look at it.
Nothing.  I don't know anything!
Of course you are.  You couldn't do those terrible things.  Come home with me  -  maybe things will make sense then...
Don't worry.  You won't even see her.
We'll be back for you first thing tomorrow and if you need me for anything, Duane will be right outside the door.
Great.
Oh, sure.  Remember the convention speech?
... Alright.
I'm... not... nobody...
Well, maybe I am.  But you're fired.
Yeah.
Fine...
Fine.
... What?
Bob...
Mild stroke?
Up and around?  Soon?
Oh.  Excuse me.
How long have you been waiting to pass that thing?
Bob...
He's only doing what you told him to.
... But as I began to investigate, I realized that this pattern of corruption extended much higher...
I was gonna do something with Joan.
So what do we do?
Look, I'm sorry.  I know you said not to talk, but when I saw the crowd I just got excited...
Well, it's...  It's sort of an... an `incident'  really...
Well... I gues I would... Yeah.
We had to, Dave. The guy's a choir boy.
Perceptual?
Certainly.
Oh, come on, we're not children.  I didn't have anything to do with this Fidelity nonsense and you know it.
All I've got is my integrity.  That's all I have.  Now I don't know why you turned your attack dogs on me.
He's not gonna win -- not in the end... They never do.
What?
Certainly.
That's okay.  You alright down here by yourself?
Yeah.  I'm sure it's keeping you up nights.
There's no mistake, Bill.   If you veto their funding, it's not a mistake. If you hurt someone intentionally, it's not a mistake.
I don't know.
You1re leaving, too?
He wasn't always like that, anyway.
You have a lot of secrets.
It's just more than anybody else does around here.
It was inspirational.
I mean, I want to... I just, I feel strange...
Yeah, but we got a little bit done. And if you do a little and I do a little... then maybe the next guy'll do a little...
Yeah.  And it's better than not believing it Their faces are inches apart.
Hi.
Yeah... It could be fun.
We're doing our best, sir.
And if I don't? If I don't you'll come back after your death. You'll come back and find yourself hanging there...wanting to eat...needing to eat human flesh. You hate that thought, don't you? That's the ultimate sin for most of you fools, isn't it?
No. I didn't stop the infection in time. I know.  Don't worry. When he dies, I won't be like Maria. I'll shoot him.
Look.
Let's just....wait a minute. Get a better look.
SIDDOWN, YOUNG LADY! I DONE YUP A SHIT-LOAD O' FAVOURS AND I AIN'T NEVER YET ASKED FER NOTHIN' IN RETURN! NOW HOW'D YOU LIKE TA SPEND TWO WEEKS UP T'THE VEGETABLE FARM YERSELF? THAT'S WHAT IT'LL BE IF YA DON'T SIDDOWN AN' SHUT THE HELL UP!
Gasparilla?
Farther than you think. You'll get lost. You will. And there's Bees all through the jungle. I ain't lyin' to ya. Religiosos don't lie.
You disappear in here, darlin'. You get a knife in yer belly or too much shit in yer veins. You get lost out here and nobody's gonna notice. Rhodes, he counts on that. It all makes for food in the freezers.
He's just finding another reason for bumpin' us off. Don't ya see. He needs us ta die. He needs our bodies.
Datura Metel. The Devil's Trumpet. Don't worry. I ain't goin' religioso again. It's a flower that grows on these islands. Where I come from the voodoo priests used it whenever they needed a Mickey Finn. It's toxic. Ground up you can put it in a drink or inject it...or...in a sealed area it might be introduced through the ventilation system.
Ain't no place safe.
Maybe.
We got a boat.
We're hopin' you can show us where ta go, Toby.
Quicker than gas. And it smells a lot prettier. It usually don't kill but it puts ya under fer a good night's sleep.
You can believe this, Miguel. I'll kill you if you shoot. We must wait. I'll....I'll do it....I'll do it myself....when it needs to be done.
PULL IN! GET THE OTHERS.
God....damn you, Rhodes!
You have ruined weeks of work here! We've been trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat!
We're both gonna leave. Leave the island. I've been talkin' to Tricks. We think we can smuggle out one of those inflatable rafts. They're crated up real small. They've got air canisters. There's food inside. Even a little motor.
Need what? Civilised order like we have down here? Christ!
For the good of mankind. That's what every monster-maker says.
I'll have somebody's ass for this. I'll have your ass, soldier. I'm not gonna stand here and...
Just....following procedure, sir. They're entitled to burial.
Not as bad as yours, pal.
Women swoon!
I'll tell you later.
I thought I'd be spontaneous.  I mean, that's the point of this whole thing, isn't it?
It's Nuwanda, Cameron.
So avoid using the word 'very' because it's lazy.  A man is not very tired, he is exhausted.  Don't use very sad, use morose.  Language was invented for one reason, boys--to woo women--and, in that endeavor, laziness will not do.  It also won't do in your essays.
I told you, that's a secret.
Doing fine, sir.
Good.  We're very excited about him.  He was a Rhodes Scholar, you know.
what?!
Sure.
Nothing, unless you object to having girls here.
I'm one of the proofers.  I slipped the article in.
Are you kidding?  Don't be ridiculous.
It's better than doing nothing.
It's not all right.  Come on, Dad
No.
Knox!  what are you doing here?
I don't care.  I love you, Chris.  You deserve better than Chet and I'm it. Please accept these.
All I'm asking you to do is listen.  "The heavens made a girl named Chris, With hair and skin of gold To touch her would be paradise To kiss her glory untold."
You say that over and over but you don't even know me!
Are you going with Chet?
Then come with me.
I promise.  Dead Poets honor.  Come with me tonight, then if you don't want to see me again, I swear I'll bow out.
It's just for a little while. You promised.
That goes for all of you.  Now eat with your correct hands.
Oh, Captain, My Captain. Is there poetry in math?
Rahesh Non never existed, Mr. Meeks. You make him or someone like him up.  No self important college professor such as this one would dare admit ignorance of such an obviously important figure and you will probably receive a comment similar to the one I received:
Courtyard?
A crazy madman.
A... A  sweaty-toothed madman.
Eighteen!  That's two years!  What about the play?  The performance is tomorrow night!
Isn't there an easier way?
Yeah.
It's not too bad.  It's a tragedy! Why does she have to be in love with a jerk?!
Why don't you read it to her? It worked for Nuwanda.
Yeah, you just do everything they say! You'll be in daddy's law firm as sure as I'm standing here.  And you'll be approving loans till you croak.
What I have to do.  Screw the annual.
But she's in love with: the moron son of my father's best friend.  What would the dead poets say about that?
Then you can help him.
Good boy.  Call us if you need anything.
Where is this cave he's talking about?
My brother went here.
Thanks but  I'd better do history.
I... I just don't want to come.
What is that supposed to mean?
You want me out...  is that what you're saying?
No?  What do you mean 'no'?
Quiet.  I have to think.
Maybe they don't think at all unless it's about my brother!  His birthday's always a big to-do.  The stupid thing is, I didn't even like the first one.
what?
He's the owner...
All right, be cool, everybody, nice and slow, no sudden moves.
Shut up!
Or maybe we're exactly where they want us to be.
I saved your life is what I did!
Then who are you?
You hear that?
Jesus Christ lady...
Nothing...you want to come, come... you don't...
You people...rich people...
Well, you sure do a good imitation.
Quite a few.
With the emphasis on SELF, and in selfish, right?
On the side!!
Right... You have a boat.
How do you know that?
Keep tasting...
What?
If you blow up your boat, how are we going to get to the island?
Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.
I don't take orders at all.
He's not coming...
That's it? That's all you give a shit about?
Me??
Joey, you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid?
Squid...squid like...squid type... it's got tentacles, a feed sac... probably one central nervous processor somewhere...what the hell do I know is going on deep down in the ocean...there's all sorts of shit we've never seen...eighty foot clams...60 foot sharks...I'm just guessing...can you get me more juice out of Hercules...fast?
Seafood salad.  You ever operate a jet ski?
How does an island sound to you?
Nowhere...
Yeah.
Those are mine!
What?
Hey! Fuckin' A!
What do you think, Sal? Jesus, you think we'd miss this?
You're full of shit!
Jesus, it's freezing!
It's Nick!
Well... you remember Cynthia?
Hey! Fuckin' A! Time to roll!!!
Who? Who is?
She does not!
She might!!! She might do it, Albert, but you can't fuckin' tell me that she does!!!
Angela, I just heard Sal was alive.
Where? Where is he?
You are frightened, no?
Unfortunately I must now go in, but I leave you my card. Naturellement I pay my players cash American. Just so you know.
Linda, yeah.
Oh. Fine.
You know a guy named Merle?
Yeah?
Nick, we don't know where Sal is... Nick, Angela won't tell us.
Psst. Vince!
Biederman, yes.
Biederman!
Linda, Linda...!
Fine. I'm fine. How are you?
I'll kill 'em. Anybody bothers you, I'll kill 'em!
Oh. Nothing... Sitting.
There's Vince!
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't think about the shot that much.
I don't know... I guess I think about the deer... Being out, maybe. I don't know. I think about it all. Hell, I like the trees, you know? I like the ways the trees are, all the different ways the trees are too.
From Nam?
Pow.
Huh?
What are you, God?
I'm doing that too.
What do you mean?
Sit down.
You wanna bet?
How much? How much do you wanna bet?
That's my plan.
John Wayne... Listen, Nick --
I gotta get back, Nick.
Merle? ... Merle's alive?  How do you know?
Naw.  Uh-huh.
One, Vince... you have to understand, doing it with one... would be... like nothing. They're small, see, so if you're smart you get about six or eight. I mean, if you want to have any fun.
Jesus.  Sweet Jesus.  We've got trouble.
I'm going to bring this down hard. I've got an A-1 badass killer loose, an election day after tomorrow, and I'm risking everything on you. You're going to bring him in.  I don't care how.  If you do, you'll get your freedom.  An official pardon from me.  A clean slate.  A good job.  A chance to get back with your family.  If you don't want to, I'll put your ass back in the freezer so fast, you'll forget you were ever defrosted.
Out of the room.
I'll be alright.
I was part of the escort team that re-animated him.  My partner's dead because of this guy.
I got it.  I got it.
You have to use the steering wheel to turn.  The pedal for gas...
Doucet killed my partner.
My insurance won't cover it.
Yes.
I was set up.
Thanks.
Good night.
I'm serious, Wade.  This case is important to me.
No, sir.
What else did he get?
How ya feeling?
...What are you talking about...?
This should make your day.  The guy who testified against you... Dubbs... was arrested a total number of twenty- four times.
I'm signing off.
No you don't.
This is the guy that killed my partner.
He went dirty and they made an example of him.
What's your name?
Hi.
No -- that's for me to do.
I've brought you something to keep you warm, Mrs. Stone --
He lied to me again.
That's my problem, Belle.
Young man -- you got me there.
And serve him right!
Maybe you can, sometime, Daniel. I'm a farmer, you know, and like to show my farm -- but the thing I'd like to show you most, you'll have to see for yourself.
No, siree, it didn't. And it won't -- no matter what happens -- just as long as the folks at the fair believe in freedom and Union. So --  Giddyap, Constitution -- and let's keep going, Mr. Stone.
I don't know -- don't seem much of an idea to me.
Not at all, Hank ... not at all. Glad to help you.
Why not! There's a bill up in Congress to give us a uniform law of bankruptcy. Daniel Webster is fighting for it right now--
That farmers' association -- we were talking about the other day.
Why, thank you, Tom. I was going to ask you if you thought I could.
Real! Sheriff, you are a witness that this money is paid me voluntarily, and while it does not satisfy the mortgage, it has become my property.
Don't say that -- I know it is --
I do -- and I think you should too.
Oh, you know the old story -- the Hessian wagon train that was ambushed on the way to Saratoga. Some of the gold has been buried under your barn!
That's right, Mr. Stone -- there is --  -- just one little formality. I'd like your signature here -- see. And when it's done -- it's done for seven years.  It's our usual form. Of course -- we may be able to take up the question of a renewal in due time.
The seventh day of April --
I don't care.
Thanks, Mr. Webster!  To the champion of the whole United States -- Dan'l Webster!
I -- I don't know what you're talking about! I -- I haven't time to listen to all this --
How do you do, Belle? How are you, Jabez?  Well -- mighty elegant house you got here.
Oh yes -- yes. Won't take a minute. Can you keep a secret?
You think that's a joke? I had him on there too, but I was afraid Dan'l Webster might feel insulted.
Well -- yes --
Jabez, don't you remember your own wedding? We said it's for better or worse. We said it's for richer or poorer.
Not all of it?
Jabez -- you ought to talk to Tom about joining the Grange.
You're right, Mary it's a fine calf. That's why Stevens'll take it for the rest of the payment.
Mary -- you just wait and see -- It's all -- just the beginning -- just the beginning -- of everything. I'll be the biggest man in New Hampshire and you'll be the wife of the biggest man.
I'll get it, Jabez.
I wasn't used to being big -- wasn't used to thinking in big ways. Now, I've made up my mind.
Mary -- but look -- it didn't touch an ear of my corn -- we'll have a rich harvest.
Don't be cross with him, Ma. This don't happen every day.
Mary!
Hard luck -- like me.
Well, thank the Lord you can always depend on New England for weather. We've got enough for the whole United States.
Lan's, I'd think you was having the baby, to hear you.
Ma -- and yet, a man could change that, couldn't he?
It don't matter!
Fiddlesticks! She don't hear it. Got better music to listen to than that.  There -- that's what I mean.
Of course it's all right, son. You had Daniel Webster, didn't ye?  Breakfast's ready!  I've made a special surprise for Mr. Webster.
Very well, folks. I accept.
Why -- yes -- it's hard to put it into words, Mr. Webster. There's this matter of little Daniel's schooling and the new house -- and well -- there's something else that's wrong -- it gets worse, year after year -- it's like a shadow growing -- I can't really talk about it, even to Ma -- she puts it all on Jabez and I won't stand for that.
She'll be here in a moment. She has a special surprise for you.
If it's the British Minister, take him around to the pantry and give him some Madeira --
I'd rather see you on the side of the opposition.
Pretty good -- that's perfect!
Talk has never proved that question, Mr. Webster!  Cup for cup -- what do you say?
Then I stand on the Constitution! I demand a trial for my client.
I object.
My money? Why, Mister Stevens? What a quaint idea. Come over to the door. I want to speak to you privately. Stop throwing away that money. We mustn't let people see any softness in you, Mister Stevens.... People take advantage of softness, you know. Come out of there -- I'll give you an extension if you'll forget this stupid repentance idea.
The loneliness? Lonely with all your gold, Mister Stevens? That hardly makes sense.
Why don't you?
But meant her moving here.
Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.  I'm in charge here.
We must shut down the building.  Go wider --!
Karl, I know you want him, but the police are probably on their way. Maybe we can convince them it was all a mistake, but not if they hear gunshots! If you lock him in he'll be neutralized -- now do it!  Karl?  Karl!
You want...money?  What kind of terrorists are you?
It's useless to you!  There's seven safeguards on our vault, and the code key is only one of them!  You'll never get it open!
Who are you, then?
I told you...
Then don't waste time talking to me.
Oh?  What idiot put you in charge?
Oh...Where does he live?
Oh, here it comes.  One of those 'meaningful relationship conversations.' I never should've let you get those magazine subscriptions --
I'm ahead of you...partner.
I'm here, cowboy.
In my youth, partner.  In my youth.
I got it.  But you can tell her yourself.  Just watch your ass and you'll make it.
Roy?
Then who the hell have you been talking too?
Who the hell knows?  Maybe he was a stockbroker who looked at the Dow Jones and opted for early retirement!
Yessir.
Christ, can't you read between the lines!  He did everything he could to save him...if he gave himself up they'd both be dead!
I never make bets or guesses, that way I'm never wrong and I never have to pay out.
Don't let 'em off the ground.
Okay.
What about the kids?
Don't call yourself fat.
They're not after you, they're after me.
He says he doesn't know.  Why don't you cook whatever's there?
The robbers in the bank.  They got guns?
Yeah, well I don't blame him.
Sonny?  Don't send me away!  I can help you save your soul ...
You come in and they say, right away, that you are crazy.  And they start putting things in your arm... you know.  How do they expect you to get uncrazy if you're asleep all the time?
You're crazy.
You're really crazy.
Howard Johnson's... you're warped. You know that?  You're really warped!
I know I am.  I know!
What?
How did they think that?  What are they... crazy?  What do you mean. That's bullshit, Leon.  They're giving you a fucken story.
Look... who's on the phone?
He was under great strain: you don't understand, he's a very mixed up person.
It made him crazy - so much demand, he'd fly into this rages.  And I got more depressed than ever; I saw I'd never get the operation.  So I tried to take my life - I swallowed about a half pound of pills ... blues, reds, yellows, downers, uppers, screamers ... you name it. But I just threw them up and wound up in the hospital.  Sonny comes there and looks at me and just says: 'Wow!'  So when I hear he's in the bank, I almost go crazy because I know he's doin' it for me.
This is Detective Sergeant Moretti, asshole, we got you completely by the balls.  You don't believe me, I'm lookin' you right in the eye. Right now, I can see you...
Right -- I'm with you, buddy.
So -- you want me to send one out there ... Okay.  I'll see what I can do.
It's okay, you got a lot of protection.
I want to see my wife.  I want you to bring her down here.
Is on its way ... The helicopter can't land but we got a bus ... the jet's on its way to Kennedy ... we got a bus coming here ...
Sonny, your wife's on the way ... We reached her ... your wife's on the way ... everything you asked for, you got.
It can't happen again ... I'll do everything I can to stop anything I can ...
I'm not ... I'm not ... you're gettin' a bus ... you're gettin' a bus ... the jet's comin' into Kennedy ... and your wife's on the way ... what else do you need? What else can I get you?  Listen, I don't know how you can do better ... see that man over there ... the FBI guy ...
There won't be ... there won't be ... What else do you need?  How else can we help you?
He hasn't so far.  I'm the one who can make a mistake.  That's what scares the shit out of me.
I can take care of that.
Well, you get your mind right.  I'm a Catholic and I don't wanna hurt nobody, but goddamn it, don't you play no games with me.  Unnastand?!?
Come on, lemme load you up...
It's locked on the inside.  It's through that passageway and to the right.
Mulvaney...
They make $105 a week to start. They fold the flag, check the place out in the morning.  I don't know what they learn, Sonny.
Yeah?
Howard!
What about Howard?
I told you, he's got diabetes.
You were terrific, too!
Oh, a long time.  Because I kept asking my husband where the heck could Junior be?  He wasn't around here.  I thought maybe he was in prison or some place.
Yeah.
You stopped?  Why?
For God's sake!  As soon as I'm outta this bank robbery, I'm gonna stop ... okay?
You know, you remind me of my 19- year-old brother - only he's got his hair down to his knees - he looks like something that eats berries and roots out of the ground. God forbid I should say something to him like, 'Listen, if you ever smoke marijuana, just remember that it's illegal' and he storms outta the house.  You rob a bank, but you keep your body pure, is that it?
Fuck him - let him out!
Let's go, Sonny.
Dead or alive?

What kind of a deal?
Wyoming.
Everybody!  Back here!
Get over there!
Have him walk in backwards.
I wouldn't like to, but I will, if I have to.
We'll have hamburgers on the plane. You ready?
I am.
What's the matter... they never housebroke you?
They're beautiful ...
My God, Sonny - you oughtta see - Alla Brooklyn is here!  On all 3 networks!
I talked to the FBI, I told them about you, they said if you just come outta the bank it's gonna be okay.
Oh my God!  I don't understand.  If you needed money, why couldn't you come to me?  Everything I got is yours.  I got two hundred and maybe twenty-five in the savings.  It's yours.  You know it.
Did I say a thing against her?  God forbid I should say anything against that fat cunt.
I know you wouldn't need Leon if Heidi was treating you right.  The thing I don't understand is why you come out and sleep with Heidi anyway?  You got two kids on welfare now.  What're you goin' to bed with her, you don't have enough with one wife and two kids on welfare, you want a wife and three kids on welfare?
What'll you do?  Come out.
No!
No.  This really pissed him off, Sonny.  He says you're dead.  He says he doesn't have a son.
Doing what?
Get a job doing what?  You gotta be a member of a union, no union card - no job.  To join the union, you gotta get the job, but you don't get the job without the card.
Wait a minute ... I'm talkin' to you.  I'm askin' you a question ...
Yeah!  We're hot entertainment, right?  You got me and Sal on TV ... we're entertainment you sell, right?
Then talk about somethin' you fuckin' know about ...
<i>Choco grew up on the streets of El Salvador. When he was four years old... he stabbed another kid in the eye-ball with a pencil.</i>  <i>There were wires crossed somewhere in his soul.</i>
Did it hurt?
<i>I'm calling from the Kappa Epsilon Gamma house at California University.</i>
My Frances? Frances and Charles have been kidnapped? <b> EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- NEXT </b>
<i>What happened to them?</i>
He sent us out to the Fender Compound. Out in the desert near the Chicken Ranch.
That's the rumor on the street.
<i>Her car was in the shop.</i>
No. Please enlighten me.
<i>Mescaline.</i> <b> INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NIGHT </b> Domino and the others are all drinking coffee. Alf stares out through the windshield at the GLOW of Vegas in the distance.
Must you use that awful word?
It's Choco. And he's not my boyfriend. He's a bounty hunter.
He used to date Pat Benatar!
Where the fuck do you think you're going?
Yeah?! Well... I loved her too.
I found him pan-handling on Third Street Promenade. Took him under my wing. We been hunting together ever since.
Hello?
You're wearing eyeliner. You look like a queen.
He said... take his right arm.
Your theory is valid... <i>in theory.</i>
In theory.
<i>The tough get going.</i>
I be.  I'm living large.
My brother.
Have you noticed something about them?
And?
Jade, I still love you.
It's about turning that shit off and getting the fuck outta my pizzeria.
We're not hanging out.  I'm being escorted back to work.
OK, but listen up.  I'm gonna break it down.
A motherfucking year off the motherfucking boat and got a good business in our neighborhood occupying a building that had been boarded up for longer than I care to remember and I've been here a long time.
Too long!  Too long.  Now for the life of me, I haven't been able to figger this out.  Either dem Koreans are geniuses or we Blacks are dumb.
No!
I don't know how he does it.
I just wanted to know who named ya Sweet Dick Willie?
One day you'll be nice to me.  We might both be dead and buried, but you'll be nice.  At least civil.
Fool, there's a lot in this world you don't know.
I wasn't trying to be a hero.  I saw what was about to happen and I reacted, didn't even think.  If I did, I might not have done it in second thought.  Da Mayor is an old man, haven't run that fast in years. 
I didn't.
Wake up!
Don't ya love ya brother Mookie anymore?  I loves ya, Jade.
I'm working.
What responsibilities?
I'm coming.
Yo, I'm gone.
Stop tripping.
He's just being nice.
One has nuthin' to do with the other.
I'm getting paid...
Pretty soon I'll be making a move.
Sorry, comb got caught.
How are you holding up in this weather?
I'm not studying no Mayor.  Besides, he reminds me of my least favorite peoples.  My tenants and my ex- husband--Goddamn-bless his soul.
Don't worry about it.
What is?
That's my name.
It's a motherfucking shame.
Be off in a second.  Tina, I dedicated a record on Mister Señor Love Daddy's show to you.
Big deal?  If that's not LOVE, I don't know what is.
Depends.
You know you don't get paid till we close tonight.  We're still open.
Here, you gotta delivery.
I didn't say nuthin'.  You must have a guilty conscience.  What are you guilty of?
You only pay me two-fifty a week.  I owe you fifty bucks.
I work too, but I still make time.
I can't be staying long anyway.
A quickie is good every once in a blue moon.
Trust me.
Of course I'm sweating.  I'm burning up.  It's hot, moron, only a hundred degrees in here.
I am a man.
What?
Y'know, I've been listening and reading 'bout Farrakhan, ya didn't know that, did you?
Fuck you.  Anyway, Minister Farrakhan always talks about the so-called "day" when the Black man will rise.  "We will one day rule the earth as we did in our glorious past."  You really believe that shit?
Y'know, Vito, I know Pino is ya brother and shit, but the next time he hits ya, the next time he touches ya, you should "house him." Kick his ass.
If you don't make a stand, he's gonna be beating ya like a egg for the rest of your life.
I was going to buy a slice.
I know so.  He, them, they're not to be trusted.
Since when do you know what's best for us?
We don't know nuthin' else.
Actually we have something for you.
Actually, my name is Cindy, the accent just helps me meet boys.
Four colors? Neato!
Yeah. Look at this polar bear. It hasn't moved in half an hour. And those Eskimos over there...I'm sure at least one of them is a mannequin.
Oh, you want to talk about your delicates?
Yeah, but I'm buying.
She says that she's got more important things to do now that the new mall opened.
Very good. Back in a jiff.
What? No! Look.
No, I'm fine thanks.
Yes, Harry. I can't home school you anymore. So maybe it's time to make some new friends, some friends your own age...
Is that what I think it is?
You're it.
You brave soldier.
HARRY, what are you doing? She's a foreign exchange student. She doesn't speak the English.  CHING CHONG ching chingy chingy chong chong.
I know the type. Lives in the basement, smells like a sponge...
Exactly! A pirate!
A-ha! You landed on Candyland! Now swallow it!
I learned it from listening to you! I hate you!
Shut up Lloyd. You're not married yet.
You look familiar. Did I have your brother?
Okay. Anyone else have any questions?
And he invented fire.
That's why you have to drink it fast, trust me.
Ow... What do you want to do, HARRY?
HARRY, I said don't 'dress like a Queen'!
Yeah, but we still haven't found any treasure.
I think she wants me to come over to put me into the right position to check out her delicates, what ever that means.
I bet you want your head scratched.
HARRY!
Go away, assface.
You wouldn't get it. Just a private joke between best friends.
A blimp.
Yeah, that's why I asked.
D2.
That's because Captain Rob is not a pirate. We've been through this.
Something about showing the world what Principal Collins has done.
Put a fork in me Harry, lets get started.
Roger that, Wilco.
And with that complete loser
Right.
Damn! What are the odds?
That's the one I wanted.
That's gross.
Look Ms. Heller, there's something fishy here, and I don't think it's Friday's special.
I don't know what you're talking about.
That's not your tape.
Special Needs class.
You're just jealous.
Do you want me to pet your head?
Checking up on my friend, Harry.
I know, you want go for a ride.
Tomorrow night?
Oh, go on.
This is so embarrassing, it's never happened before. Well, maybe a couple of times, but I was alone.
Principal of jail. Wow. What a promotion.
Can you believe it?
Of course it does.  Obviously in denial.  Maybe we can help.
Go in there and get us two slushees.
He passed away three years ago.
He was a big loser! What are you deaf!?
Oh, yeah he was straight all right, just wasn't very good in the sack. I used to give him directions. Higher, lower, faster, harder, small circles, do the alphabet. Useless.
No, it actually fit quite nicely.  Well, except for the fact that it wasn't really as long as it was wide.
Damn right I did it. Went back and set the house on fire, his little floozy testified in court - and I ended up doing ten years at Rikers, got my teeth knocked out by Mike the Dyke.
Yeah, I get it. Don't worry I studied acting at the police academy just let me do the talking and you'll be fine.
And I you.
How baby-cakes? You've done it all.
Yes, it's the big potato. Just have a look at this.
We start our own class?
Aloha means hello and goodbye.
Yes!
And...?
Who's there?
The chest! The chest that I put my papers in.
Sweetheart keep up with me for half a minute. The evidence of every scam we ever pulled. The evidence that's going to put us away for twenty years.
I am your Truthsayer, my lord...  He is here, my lord.
They said you were dead.  They said...
Here is why this Fremen has taken service with me, to ask that one question. Delay is as dangerous as the wrong answer. Shadout is Chakobsa... knife, in Chakobsa is... maker of death.  It's a maker...
My lady, when one has lived with prophecy for so long, the moment of revelation is a shock.
I can't... I can't.
Yes...
Yes...
You saw a part of what the race needs in the beginning.  In time you perverted the truth.  You sought to control human breeding and intermix a select few according to a selfish master plan.  How little you understand.
I am a servant of the His Majesty the Emperor. I have served His Majesty on Arrakis long enough for my eyes to change.
What do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon?
Too bad... thought they were Harkonnen.
Let us say I suggest you may be human. Your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts. Your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box. If you do so you will die. You will feel an itching -- there... see? Now the itching becomes burning... heat, upon heat, upon heat.
SILENCE... SILENCE.
You feel the flesh crisping?
What can be done has been done.
Those sounds could be imitated.
My father sent you to test me. Music then?
No.  I never drink -- wine.
Yes.  There is nothing more comfortable.
No.
I predict we're lost.
I told you, I don't want any of your goddamn coffins.
Huh?
I don't want anything.  I'm just a really big, big fan.  I've seen all your movies.
Eh, that was a terrible production. Renfield was a drunk!
Thank you.
I apologize.  When I play Dracula, I put myself into a trance.  It takes me much time to re-emerge.
I have no next picture.
Hey Bela, how do you do that?
Don't worry.  I do it every Halloween.
I don't understand.
Ah, so I pull the strings!
They do?  Shoot.  There <u>must</u> be a way to get around that...
I didn't feel well...
Goulash.
Morphine, with a demerol chaser.  Eddie, I'm so broke.  I don't know what I'm gonna do...
"Greetings.  I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure." Audience laughs.  Applause.  "Say, that's a funny place to sleep."
"Oh, tract housing, huh?"  Laugh. "You need a new real estate agent."
This is the Philosophical Research Society.  A refuge for free thinkers. I've been coming here for twenty years.
Eddie, you screwed up.
I know it's a lot to give you at the last second.
Formaldehyde.
Soon, Bela... Soon.
Uh... you're a very important and respected man.  You're leaving your house... and you're in a hurry to a big social event.
Eddie, how was I?
Did you see that kid grab Vampira's tits?
Yeah, she's really somethin'.
And once I'm a woman, Jean-Claude and I are getting married --
Rolling.
Absolutely!  It's just the beginning. I promise this: If we stick together, one day I'll make every single one of you famous.
This is kind of a stream--
And who may you be?
Ah.  The director of "Glen Or Glenda."
I'm Criswell.  I know all.
I guessed.
Aw, er, it's just a bunch of hot air. I had to say something to get in the door.
You got the job?!!
Better than not getting a job?
I thought he was dead.
Boy, I can't even remember the last time he was in a picture.
Well, I'd really like to know what you think.  Why don't you go in the bedroom and take a look at it?  I'll Wait...
Hon', nobody's bothered but you.  Look around -- they couldn't care less.
Tell him "Bride" is in pre- production.
I told you this was gonna happen.
I see the usual gang of misfits and dope addicts are here.  Say, who's the lug?
Dolores, I got five days to shoot this movie.  Quit kidding around.
Hmm.  Those sound kind of small.  Oh, here's one that looks good: Janet Lawton.  I'd sure like to play her.
Well then you should pay him, shouldn't you?
What are you looking at me like that for?  I already gave you my three hundred.
Sure thing, Mr. Kravitz.
Well, uh, if I could I would...
Well, Mr. Feldman, some people have resumes to show.  I've got my own movie.
It's a guaranteed blockbuster!
Just, it doesn't look like very much.
Yes?
Oh, of course!
Mm, not good-lookink enough.
But I thought me and Dolores had something.
Don't worry.  We're almost there.
We're escaping!
Tell me about it.  I'm supposed to do a thriller at Universal, and they want Charlton Heston to play a <u>Mexican</u>!
It is when it works.  You know the one film of mine I can stand to watch?  "Kane."  The studio hated it... but they didn't get to touch a frame.  Ed, visions are worth fighting for. Why spend your life making someone else's dreams?
So you're not gonna make the movie?
Tits.
Yeah, but if you took that crap and put a star in it, you'd have something!
Yeah!  <u>Lugosi</u>!
Because he's <u>my friend</u>.
There's still a sex-change --
This is my thirteenth pair.
Oh, hi.
Not good...
Okay?
STOP!
Hell, if I did, I wouldn't have any friends.
Let's get married.
<u>Right now</u>.  Let's drive to Vegas!
No!  I don't want you to show the movie, I want you to be <u>in it</u>!  See, maybe I should explain: We started shooting, but then after three days we got shut down.  So we're having a backers party, to raise some more money.  Perhaps you'd like to come next door and meet some of the backers...?
You don't wanna be noticed?
Lines around the block.
We couldn't afford any more props. If it seems weird, maybe you can add a scene where they eat dinner.
And you're gonna make a bundle.  This movie's gonna be famous!  But only if you SHUT UP, and let me do it my way!
You know, you're a very attractive girl.
Oh.  Yeah.  You.
No! Do they show you having sex?
Is Mom here? I gotta talk to her.
Yeah. Ma...
Who?
I'm not -- I didn't -- Al, you know how I feel about you...
Yes!
Um, yeah -- thanks.
Don't say that. That's like... telling a guy before you have sex you'd better be good. You don't do that.
And all the kids stared calling me "Pumpkin Ass." "Hey Pumpkin Ass," -- for like a year. So, now, I feel like everyone's watching me and, you know, I'm "Pumpkin Ass" again.
Can I give you one bit of advice? About Shari?
You know, everything you asked me to do I did. I call you for advice about Shari you say -  "Leave her be, see other people for a while." You just wanted me to get involved with Jill because it made for a better show.
Mm...  Oh, man...
What about him -- did he suffer any or was it quick? I'd hate to think he...
Look at this -- people are getting married, they're getting married...
We're falling behind.
Tell me.
Oh -- so I'm just, what -- a poor substitute?
No! I -- All right, look, if you hear from Ray.... tell him to call me, okay?
So everything he told me yesterday was a lie. Everything.
But what was that whole story about him and a nurse?
So does Grandma. So does Shaquille O'Neal. You told me you had a hysterectomy and he ran off with your nurse.
The difference is for twenty years I thought one thing and now it's another thing.
He had a woman in my own bed! And how dare you call him "Dad" in front of Al.  This is your father. This is who was there for you when you needed someone.
Everybody's making audition tapes for that Real TV thing.
Well, no. You agreed to stay on the air as long as we asked you to. The station entered into this on that understanding. If you had refused we'd have begun this with somebody else. You can't just change the rules in the middle of the game, son. It's not fair to us. More importantly, it's not fair to the viewers. They're interested in you. They've devoted hours and days and weeks of their lives to you.
No, I mean...
Never would be plenty.
I hear the dog really liked him.
Yeah, well...
You should see the one we wear when it rains.
I know, I ...
Ed... I think we should stop seeing each other.
Exactly. Boy, you're smart.  Why are you so mean to her? What did she do to you?  "Is she good enough for Ed?" Who the hell am I?  Who the hell do you think I should be dating?
No... Could you?
It's nice.
What do we have to do?
What are you drunk?
That's like... those people stitching Nikes in Panama saying they're in the NBA.
In a second! In a hot second. Let me ask you something --
Screw off.
I don't know.
Hey. You know-- we're not the same. I got a good life, this job suits me. I come and go when I please --
See, they should've picked him. Look how comfortable he is out there.
It's me, Ed.
Oh. All right. I'11 watch at home, then.
Stop? I'm a guy. I don't stop. The woman's supposed to stop. We're the gas, they're the brakes.
You brought the cameras here!
Save it.
Cassie...
Yeah. My problem is I've got a brother who writes a sentence like "We grew up in a small, little bedroom." As opposed to a big, little bedroom?
A hundred per cent cotton. Okay, here we go, Andy.
Who's Shari?
No problema.  You want a picture?
I love you! 1 want to marry you!
It could be, if you fixed it up. How did you... ? I mean how does anyone ... wind up like this?
Ed... I'm sorry.
What happened? You described this "crazy-kooky" family who'd be a million laughs on TV?
Foxy. . . Foxy. . . You know you're a cute little heartbreaker... Foxy... You know you're a sweet little love maker...
Yeah, it's serious.  I mean she inspires me in ways Sherry never has. She even wants to read my novel.
That's the whole point. It's all in my head; it's right here.  I just got to get it out there. Tracy wants me to write it so she can read it.  It's beautiful.
Well, I notice you don't seem to have any close friends at Millard. You seem to be kind of a loner.
Thank you.
Here, get down.
Yeah, uh, just a minute
Dick... Dick,..
Dick.
Well, I thought that... well, the way it always works is that SGA president does a count, then the SGA advisor, you know, for the two independent counts.
Yeah?
You bet.
Should be easy.  So far no competition.
Looks like Tim Kobza.
Look, why don't we just forget about Tammy?  We'll have the assembly tomorrow, everybody'll make their speeches, and I'm sure everything will be fine.
Looks like today's your lucky day
My mother's buying me a new car for college.
Well, I got in everywhere I applied, but Cornell is my first choice.
Anywhere you want.  Just so long as we're not gone more than a half-hour.
That sounds good.
I did it.
I don't know. Yesterday.  Sunday.
Should we get a what?
Dave.
Sherry... I love you.
Don't worry about Tracy.  She'll be fine.
No way I It doesn't make sense.
So?
Huh?  Oh, hi, Tracy
Oh, yeah, sure.  Hey Nolan, give my book to Tracy when you're done*
No I haven't.  Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
That's right.  Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating.
Yeah.
You look better than Veronica Lake.  Now, <u>Pierce Patchett</u>.
If it's a date I think you'd better tell me your first name because I --
Come in out of the rain.  In the morning we'll have both our stories for breakfast.
So tell me about it.
It would've happened years ago if you hadn't carried him.  Why the loyalty, Wendell?
Your partner's through. Department scapegoat on the Chief's orders.  He's been billed, he'll be indicted and he'll swing.
Homicide?  A detective?
How'd you get them to retract?
What work?
What are you talking about?
Easy.  Tell me about the ruckus.
Hell of a way to avoid a prison sentence.
Someone held up a coffee shop, panicked and killed six people.
Lynn.
It wasn't the Negroes.  The Griffith Park report was a phony. And, who says the purple Merc was spotted outside the Nite Owl?
If I let you go, there'll be ten more lawyers to take your place tomorrow.  They just won't come on the bus, that's all.
I was here, hosting a party.  Who was killed and why do you think I can help?
You know I do or you wouldn't be here.  How did you find me?
His file listed you as a known associate.  Now spill.
Deuce Perkins.  Mickey C's narcotics lieutenant.  The night he got clipped, eighteen pounds of Mickey's heroin went missing.
All right, Ed.  Call Sergeant Vincennes.
Nothing.
Man, what're you saying?
Say what?
They shot him in his library.
Gone.  Not a trace.
And?
Would you be willing to shoot hardened criminals in the back to offset the chance --
At least get rid of the glasses. I can't think of one Bureau man who wears them.
Edmund, you don't want it and you can't have it.
I'll break them, sir.
She may still be alive, whoever she is.
And now you'll provide them.
Why not, lad?  Absolute justice?
No.
What about you?
What?
Rollo was a purse snatcher.  My father ran into him off duty.  He shot my father six times and got away clean.  No one even knew who he was.  I made the name up to give him some personality.
Hold on... We need to canvass. See if a purple Mercury was seen around here tonight.
Bud White grilled me on it this morning.  You know, he's not as dumb as I thought.
Not good enough.
I know who you are.  You're the policeman Bud told me about.
Why?
I don't hate White.  I really don't.  It's just, in my business, it's the wild cars you have to watch out for.
Why not?
I work for Patchett.  I had a feeling that there was someone else, but I never knew who.
Bisbee, Arizona.  The air's good for pensioners and I know where everything is.
Without what, his smearing yours first?  What's he got on you, Loew?  Pictures of you and an out of work actor with your pants down?
What's Dudley's scheme?
I don't doubt it -- Oh, God.
No.  It's felony possession of marijuana.
Sid, it's Vincennes.
Something good?
What about Fleur-de-Lis?  Their slogan's 'Whatever you desire.'
Sid, how are they hanging?
And Reynolds?
Sid, cut the crap.  I --
Jesus.  Jack, that's a story. 'Swish Actor Gets The Gay Blade.' Let me get my camera.
I just called it.
A bootleg...
Something like that.
You know, when I came out to L.A., this isn't exactly where I saw myself ending up.
He didn't give you an address? He didn't give you a phone number?
Maybe you bumped into someone who took it and you didn't even know.
So...how much money do you want in exchange for not ruining my life?
You're not.
Listen--
Rachel Banks?
What do they have to do with this?
You're crazy.
230 Giga-Hertz. They use that band for the Aquacade Spy-SAT uplinks.
They're spooks.
Hey, if you live another week I'll be impressed.
Look, you gave me some work over the last year. We'll call it even.
And you won't. Now move--
What do you mean?
You don't get it. They go through your phone records. They fuckin' monitor everyone you called in the last--
How do you know so much?
Jesus.
Yeah.
Jesus. Do you have proof?
Where?
<u>Here</u>?!
'Kay, well, could you walk faster, please.
Why?
They shouldn't have come without calling first.
We're not gonna hurt you.
What if we do a mailing to Congressmen.
<u>I</u> know. <u>I</u> know what they're looking for and I'm telling you.
Listen--
What if we just fucked with 'em?
Same way they did with you and me. We take their biggest guy and turn him into one of us.
No, I want the NSA to get caught spying on Albert.
Is Jerry Delsano in?
Law enforcement?
I'm married.
Pardon?
Eight.  Size eight.
Thanks.
Could you give me just a moment to talk to a friend of mine here? Not about this, but...Daniel?
<u>What's</u> your point.
I was <u>in</u> the store, the accident was outside. It was a bus.
No, sir.
<u>Yes</u>, for my wife, what the hell kinds of questions are these.
Yes sir.
I saw a man die.
In front of Harrison's, he got hit by a bus. I knew him. The firm did some pro bono work for his organization a few years back.
The thing is, when I saw him, it seemed like he wanted to tell me...  ...he was upset about something and he said...  Doesn't matter now.  I'm gonna wash up.
What do you mean?
A guy named Brill. Same guy as always.
I have lunch with Rachel once a month. She's my connection to an investigator.
I didn't want you to be upset. I shouldn't have lied. Stacy, there's nothing between me and Rachel Banks.
I'm looking at a picture of you and Rachel taken <u>yesterday</u>.
I went to the grocery store. My ATM and credit cards didn't work. I couldn't buy food.
What happened to your head?
You opened the thing?
That's gonna end tonight.
Albert's gonna get me my job back.
It's not?
Good news there, Mr. DePinto, you're talking to one.
He doesn't work that way.
Eat your fish.
Who's doing this?
The IRS contacted me this morning. They say my lifestyle and receipts exceed my income.
For the last four years.
Bullshit.
We're screwed.
I'm sorry about that.
Yeah.
This is <u>bullshit</u>. Someone's mixing up a bunch of half-truths to ruin me and to ruin my case.
You're firing me.
That's because your Union bosses <u>are</u> those Guido mother-fuckers.
Where's Stacy?
Are those my Christmas presents?
Can I open 'em up?
Having an adventure. I can't tell you about it right now, but I'll tell you about it soon.
No. We're never getting a divorce. We were having a fight. It happens sometimes.
Alright!
Usually they take clothes.
What about jewelry?
They didn't take the silverware?
Sounds like they didn't want anything that wasn't electric?
Table 122?
Into what?
I'm a labor lawyer. There are <u>always</u> mob ties.
Why would the NSA--
You gotta let me bring you in to the police.
To the cops?
Yeah?
Yeah.
Someone's trying to destroy my life, and I'd like to find out who.
Why not?
Several indiscriminates and one primary who we've ID'd as Robert Dean. A Crystal City attorney.  Mr. Reynolds?  Sir?
Destroy his credibility before he goes public. Neutralize him. I don't want anyone listening to a word he has to say. Tell me about Rachel Banks.
I just meant--
You're kidding me.
Dean's with Lyle.
Resources, that's a good point. He's got resources. All we've got is a <i>six-hundred billion dollar</i> <i>organization!</i> Now god<u>dammit</u>, Hicks, you find 'em. You find 'em and you end it now!
And if it wasn't?
He walked right up to me in church. At the holiest time of the wear. He approached me in a sanctified place.  Kill him now.
For Daniel Zavitz. I just need a signature.
I don't know what's going on, but if you people have tripped over your own asshole again, you're not gonna get any help from us. It's ending at your doorstep.
No.
Yes, thank you, Gyges, son of Daskylus - Candaules said to him I don't think you believe me when I tell you how beautiful my wife is. And although Gyges replied he did find the Queen magnificent the King insisted he would find some way to prove beyond dispute that she was fairest of all women.  Do you all know this story?
Excuse me?
I don't care to bargain.
As the wife of one of our party.
Her or me?
And the marriage - is that a fiction? 
I believe you still have my book.
Now.
What do I love?  I love rice pudding, and water, the fish in it, hedgehogs! The gardens at our house in Freshwater - all my secret paths.
A lie.  What do you hate most?
No.
No, no, it's Hungarian.  My daijka sang it to me.
That day, had you followed me to the market?
Shall we be all right?
Don't go over it again, please.
Would you let me pass?
We've got to get you out of here.
Our Garden, our garden - not so much the garden, but the copse alongside it, wild, a secret way plunging down to the shore and then nothing but water between you and France.  The Devil's Chimney it was called -  The Devil's Chimney, I don't know why.  Darling.  My darling.
Appropriate?
Are you mad?  Katharine loves it here. She told me yesterday.
I've known Katharine since she was three, my aunt is her aunt, we were practically brother and sister before we were man and wife.  I think I'd know what is and what isn't too much for her.  I think she's know herself.
I haven't, no.  Sorry.
Count Laszlo de Almásy. The Officer is writing this down.  A glance at his Corporal.
In my room.
What's the matter with you?
What do we find in the desert? Arrow heads, spears.  In a war, if you own the desert, you own North Africa.
Absolutely right, shut up. Lashings of apologies all round.
Right.
I told you so.
We don't have a doctor, but we do have a nurse.
Don't cut me.
I met your friend Mary.  She said I should stop and see if you were okay. Apparently we're neighbors - my house is two blocks from yours in Montreal. Cabot, north of Laurier.  Bonjour.
So was my Patient.
So you can shoot a pistol?
Because we're fine here.  I don't know what Mary told you about me, but I don't need company, I don't need to be looked at.
Some gave me a dress.  You know what's great?  What I'm learning? You win a war and you not only gain the miles you get the moral ground. Everywhere I go, we're in the right. I like that.
Ask him.
No-one should own music.  The real question is who wrote the song?
I've had a drink.  Fatal.
Me?
I see.
Darling, for goodness' sake!
Aren't you?
Can't we really go home?  I can't breathe. Aren't you dying for green, anything green, or rain, wouldn't you die to feel rain on your face? It's Christmas and it's all - I don't know - if you asked me I'd go home tomorrow.  If you wanted.
Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise.
Oh no, really.  She has her book.
To arm-twisting.
I'm not laughing at you.  Go on, please.
Yes.  Dropping off.
Why are people always so happy when they collide with someone from the same place?  What happened in Montreal when you passed a man in the street - did you invite him to live with you?
Yes?
Your friend?
Please, don't waste your time on pleasantries -
He came back, he says he caught a rabbit.  I'm cooking it.
Yes, of course, I'm so sorry. Stupid of me. Hana gets up, upset to have hurt him.
Really?  That's sudden.
Why?  Is he staying?
The Germans were here.  The Germans were all over this area.  They left mines everywhere.  Pianos were their favorite hiding places.
There's a mine here, but the others are far enough away, I think at least to give me a chance.  I have to work out which one to cut before I fall over.
I promise you that was the right thing to do.  He's my good luck.  Now cut.  This one.  I hope we don't die.
Actually, you can't cut, can you? You'll fall over.  Give me the pliers.
I try not to expect you.
Then I'd think there must be a reason.
He can't even move.
He's from there - edge of Lake Ontario right, Soldier?
I'd like to spend a night with you in a bed.
A bit of one.
This is making me incredibly angry.
I think I might go inside and sit down for a few minutes.
Hana, we have discovered a shared please - the boy and I.
What's he saying?
This was your garden?
Through a window.
Entry through the doors or vents triggers instant alarm.
He unscrewed the bolts, reset them on rollers, then slid the whole frame away. No more effort than it takes to vacuum a floor.
Let a thousand flowers bloom. Chairman Mao.
Meaning no one arranges calalilies like that. He left the window open when he came in. His only mistake.
Exactly.
Look, trust me. I know what I'm doing.
Something of great value, something of such artistic and historic significance that only you could truly appreciate...
So you've heard all those stories about me. Well, I can assure you they're not true. And if they were true, I've retired.
Look on the back. What do you see?
That's what you're buying. Put it in your pocket.
What's your problem? I'm doing the job.
We go underwater?
I drilled the bolts and went in through the window. It was the only way to bypass the smart glass.
It was perfect.
We get the Mask I'll tell you.
Oh, I think you can do it. Probably.
Charged?
Don't get any ideas. Of course it comes out of your share.
Little celebration before we set off.
In eye of that painting.
These rooms are solid stone. They haven't changed.
Ready.
The Mask.
Yes. Yes.
There is no big job.
Get the hell in.
My eighty, your twenty, smart guy--
I always knew you'd do the job.
There's food in the fridge. I won't be long.
I'd taken the Mask?
Right. The eight billion.
A parting gift from the Empire.
We're doing it tonight.
That's the beauty of it. There's only one tiny window of time when this will work. At the handover of Hong Kong--from Britain to China. The handover from them to us.
I've covered everything. And you're the best, so--
Charged.
Packed.
Can't break tradition. It's bad luck.
You can do it.
Get out of here!
Nothing is wrong. Everything is the way it has to be. In my left coat pocket is a packet. Passports, hotel reservations, tickets.
What about you?
You gave them the eight billion.
Which is--
Had to get a liquid plasma screen.
That's it, I sure as hell ain't no personal shopper.
We're supposed to.
Faith is angels dancing on the head of a pin. I got to have trust.
I figured that out.
You got a real problem with priorities, you know that?
We wear so many goddam masks after a while they get stuck to our faces, you know? And they don't come off. But when you find the one person who really knows you, and then you lose her...
Erin, you've been here three weeks.  If you don't know how to do your job by now, I am not about to do it for you.
I'm gonna assume that was meant as a compliment, Anna, and just say thank you.
Hey, excellent.  Thanks.
What do you think?  What's this?
Erin Brockovich.  Car accident.  Not her fault, she says.  And she looks like such an honest girl, don't you think?
Right.  Lap-dancers are people too.
Usually, in adults, it's from exposure to bacteria or a virus or ...
You're a lawyer?
Yeah, I'm real glad you brought that up.  I was going through your file here, and I ran into these medical records.  They kinda surprised me --
Yeah, I can see that.  I guess the only thing that confused me is - - not that your medical problems aren't important, but -- how come the files about them are in with all the real estate stuff?
Wow.  Why would they do that?
The what?
Not around here.  This is a rough part of the world.  Hard times, not a lot of money, not a lot of luck.  It's a challenge, staying healthy in a town like this.  Heck, even our dogs up and die.
I know.  But the toxicologist I been talking to?  He gave me a list of problems that can come from hexavalent chromium exposure. And everything you all have is on that list.
Right, but -- didn't you say he was paid by PG&E?
Well, then -- if you're feeling up to it, maybe we should talk shop.
Five million dollars.
It's enough -- for whatever you need, for whatever your girls need, for whatever your girls' girls need -- it'll be enough.
Any school you want.
... just wanna be a good mom, a nice person, a decent citizen.  Just wanna take good care of my kids.  You know?
I told you the questions might get a little personal --
You did?  Wow, sorry about that.  Listen, Mario's a little not so bright.  He seems to think that you said --
I don't need pity.  I need a paycheck.  And I've looked, but when you've spent the last six years raising babies, it's real hard to convince someone to give you a job that pays worth a damn.  So I figure, since you're the one who said I was gonna be okay, you should be the one to hire me.
Don't bother.
He wanted you to know the legal limit for hexavalent chromium, is .05 parts per million.  And that at the rate you mentioned, .58, it could be responsible for the cancers in that family you asked about. The Irvings.
Erin --
It's not about working hard --
Well -- I found one document at the water board that had a toxic test well reading from 1967.  A hell of a lot of people have lived on that land since then.
And that's what caused the contamination?
Yeah?  Then gimme another raise.
Really?  It makes me sick.
You didn't care about my case?
Well, good, Ed.  I like working with you too.
Boy, this job takes me to some of the best damn places, huh?
Don't joke.  They might.  So do me a favor and behave yourself for once.  Ed Masry to see Kurt Potter.
Erin, it's just a meeting.
And, what, I'm not serious?
"Fun?"  Jesus, "<u>fun</u>?"  I kill myself for a year and a half, hand you the best case of your life on a God damn silver platter, remind you of why you became a lawyer in the first place, and you think of me as "fun?"
No one's taking anything --
Because.  They know the evidence; they know they're gonna lose a jury trial.  Maybe they wouldn't lose 400 million bucks, but once you factor in all they'd spend on this case in the next ten years, it makes a lot of --
You're not gonna be there.
This isn't doctor's orders.  It's mine.  I'm saying you can't come.
How do you know that?
The firm took in sixty.  That's three percent.  Seemed like a fair bonus to me.
And ...?
I guess I did.
Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic.  Bad, bad stuff.
Some kind of half-wit, no-good, big-haired, bimbo, I bet.
Hi, Rosalind, this is Erin.  Brockovich. From the file room?  I was wondering if you could tell Mr. Masry that I'm following up on that real estate thing out of the office.
So did I.
Yup.  They must be important, too, cause they came on a special plane.
Yeah, I'm gonna start sleeping here.  Masry & Vititoe, can I -- damn it.  Does anyone know anything about these phones?
Yeah, we had them couriered over.  And listen, good work.  They're a great start. We're just going to have to spend a little time filling in the holes in your research.
You don't know six hundreds plaintiffs' numbers by heart.
Well, I'm the neighbors.  There, now we're introduced, so you can shut the fuck up.
I'm not a deadbeat.  I work when I need to.
Yeah, we'll just see about that, won't we?
Well, I'm sure as hell not what I thought I was gonna be.  I was supposed to have one of those great lives, with everything all laid- out and perfect.  I mean, hell -- I was Miss Wichita, for God's sakes.  Did I tell you that?  You live next door to a real live beauty queen.  I still got the tiara.  I kept it cause I thought it meant something.  I thought it meant I was gonna do something great with my life.  I thought it proved I was gonna grow up to be someone.
I'm just saying --
Yeah.  We were sitting around at lunch and she pointed at a ball and said, "ball."
Yeah, well -- good help is hard to find.
I'm real sorry, Laura.
I know.  But it's good for me.  Now I can help my daughter take care of my grandkids. And it's good for you, too.  Now you have money, you can find a good babysitter, huh? Not the old lady next door.
Yes?
Is this a joke?  Did Baxter put you up to this?
You did?
The Emperor?
Move this ship out of the asteroid field and into a position where we can send a clear transmission.
Alert all commands.  Calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory and disburse the fleet to search for them.  Don't fail me again, Admiral, I've had quite enough!
I'm cold ... so cold ...
But Han and Leia will surely die.
And that is why I must go.
You won't.
Okay, okay.
I'm sure I'll see you again, too. Keep well.  You'd better chain him until it's over.
What happened?
A great warrior?  Not many on those.  Wars don't make one great.
Can't get your ship out?  Have you tried?  Have you tried?
Okay, Artoo, let him have it. Now get out of here, little fellow, we've got things to do.
Oh, your father ... a powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi.
Sergeant, is Commander Skywalker back yet?
Yes ... yes.  That would be a great asset.
The Empire won't look for you out here.  I'd say you're all set ... which means it's time for me to get going.
I must admit there are times I don't understand human behavior.
Come on, your highness, are you telling me you haven't been thinking about that kiss?
Probably an asteroid field ....
I'm against that.
Now you're making sense.
They're just trying to see if they can stir something up ... we're safe.
You mean a man you can control.
The entrance is collapsing!
The fleet is finally breaking up. I'm hoping they'll follow standard Imperial procedure and dump their garbage before they go into light speed.
Never heard of that system.
A mining colony.
Let Ôer go, Chewie.
You look great.
Luke!  I'm sure he's fine.  Probably sitting around wondering what we're doing right now.
Now don't get the wrong idea, pal. She was just trying to express her true feelings for me.
Vader agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.  They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe.
You will find them well enough. But they must never again leave this city.
I forget nothing, Calrissian. Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.
I'm altering the bargain.  Pray I don't alter it any further.
Not really.
Yes, we keep pollution down by having the power reactor far below the city.  It's connected by a transfer shaft.
I didn't say anything?
Luke!
Is there any chance of them surviving out there?
So much has happened during the period of your indisposition, sir.
Let's go.
What did you say?!
Luke, no!  It's a trap.
He'll survive.
I thought I was in good shape.
No!  No different!  The differences are in your mind.  Throw them out! No longer of use are they to you.
Size has no meaning.  It matters not.  Look at me.  Judge me by my size do you?
But I feel The Force flowing!
No!  Nothing more will I tell you now. Clear your mind of questions ... Quiet now be ... at peace ...
Control, control you must learn of what you see.  Not easy, not fast.
If it must be.  Yes.
No!
Time will tell.
Never.
Yes, Sir .... we have visuals ... the System is supposed to be devoid of human forms ...
Anything on the Millennium Falcon?
I want that ship.
Believe what?
Dr. Milo, please don't call my wife mad.
C'mon, Snake - it's L.A. Everything's phony, you know that.
Go on now. Do as I say.
He jumped. Down there.  He's dead, Cuervo. I did it. I killed Plissken.
Sure, Cuervo, but look here. I've done it all, man. I killed Plissken, I got your girl back, I got it all. Just for you, Cuervo. Just for you.
You told me he was dead.
Where?
We have a little arrangement. Anything happens to me, you're dead.
Cuervo Jones has more firepower than two armies. No one gets near him.
I'd like to get out but I don't have enough money.
We get the girl and the prototype. And we get out.
If I'm late, Carjack, don't start without me.
Somebody get off!
Can you land?
My name is no longer Carjack. Will you please get that through your fucking head?
Tell the President to adopt. I think I'll like L.A.
You don't understand. It's already in you.
Let's just say it's what's best for the country.
No.
It's history. I gotta go.
Where'd they go?
Who? You mean Cuervo Jones? He's the man with the juice, Snake. Got the President's daughter. Setting up a citywide truce. Big doings.
Cuervo's got a place near Venice, where the big birds fly. Nice digs, too. I've been there, y'know.
Bluebacks. I'm not bullshittin'. I swear to God.
Yeah. The place kept changing owners. Finally went bankrupt. That thing in Paris killed 'em.
Yeah. So how do I get to Venice?
Oh no, it's the Doctor.
You need help.
I don't know. Somehow, I just can't leave.
I know that. There are people in some of these cars.
Find Cuervo Jones.
He heard Lady Guenevere's request and he said nothing. That is all.
--By itself it is only a piece of steel. Its power comes from he who wields it. For now there is no one. Do as I have ordered!
So be it, to the death.
We spared the lives of a few, so they could sail home and tell their fellows what fate they met at the hands of King Arthur's knights...
Only give me leave to ride out again, to do what I am most able to do, and happiest doing.
I dreamed of him too... Merlin lives! He lives in our dreams now, in that dark and shadowy place that is as strong and real as this more solid one. He speaks to us from there.
In the great book.
The book without pages. Open before you, all around us. You can see it in bits and pieces, for if mortal men were to see it whole and all complete in a single glance, why, it would burn him to cinders.
You're not listening. Your heart is not. Love is deaf as well as blind.
Then answer me this. For years peace has reigned in the land. Crops grow in abundance, there is no want. Every one of my subjects enjoys his portion of happiness and justice, even those whose tiresome misunderstandings we must resolve here each day. Tell me, Merlin: have we defeated evil, as it seems?
That is my destiny. I have a destiny, too...
I know. I have heard noises and echoes through the stones...
Rise, Mordred.
Well hurry then, and get it.
I don't know. Merlin brought you to me when you were newly born and charged me to raise you as my own. At first, I did so because I feared Merlin, later because I loved you.
Ye...
No. I meant not to be angry with you, Sir Gahalt. In the idleness that comes with peace gossip has bread its own evil. You merely repeat it. Please, sir, have one of those apples that Lancelot loves, and in that gesture partake of its goodness.
You and the land are one. Drink from the chalice. You will be reborn and the land with you.
There is one.
--Nothing!
You're a man?!  ...with metal skin!
I will run.
Twenty days!? The world is that big?
--It must wait, child. These good ladies, for whom I intervened once, will honor me with a meal. I am beholden to them now as I was when they begged my protection.
Can it truly be used for magic?
That I cannot.
Flattery! Do you think I am ignorant of your stupid little games? Preying on you weakness of others. That's your power, a petty evil. Mine is great. Great plans. Impossible dreams. Laughable endings...
I am the desert, where water disappears--
Talk. Lovers murmuring to each other...
You didn't ask!
To kill and be king, is that all?
Why it's perfectly plain, your the teacher at the college, you don't want the building torn down.
Well what's wrong?
What's he doing there? Teaching?
Don't you think he's too old, though? How's his health?
I don't know. No, not really I suppose. But I've made a prudent judgement that it meets the conditions set down in the Ritual.
Yes.
Why don't you let me?
What didn't he tell you?
Burke.
Want to ask him?
When she's well enough, I'll ask.
Really? wow.
She is going to be well?
Why the math?
No. Of course not, nothing like that.
It's the other way around. The society sent me through med school.
Yes am.
I beg your pardon?
Why, I don't understand?
But how?
You could do it yourself...
Nothing you could do would make it any worse.
No.
Not at all. Why d'you ask?
What?
Really, what kind was it a mair or guilding?
Yeah.
I wouldn't talk.
I don't know
You can bring Mr. Dennings if you like.
But you like him.
I don't know, I just thought.
Why does God let us get tired?
St. Mike's.
That's good.
So what's wrong with her?
There was nothing you could do. Lye down. C'mon.
Are you gonna steal my shoes now?
Ah, that's good. That's all that's important. Back to business. Back to work. Bye now, Father.
You might loosen the straps then.
And I'm the Devil! Now kindly undo these straps!
In here. With us.
If that's true, then you must know my mother's maiden name. What is it?
What an excellent day for an exorcism.
Uh Huh.
Uoy era ohw.
How's your leg?
No.
Momma, I'm all right, I'm fine, really I am.
I would like you to go quickly over to the resdence Damien, and gather up a cassock for myself, two surplices, a purple stole, and some holy water, and your copy of The Roman Ritual. The Large one. I believe we should begin.
But deliver us from the evil one.
As it was in the begin is now and ever shall be, world without end, amen.
And the son of iniquity be powerless to harm her.
Amen
Amen
... upon this your servant, Regan Teresa MacNeil.
She'll go into coma.
From the psychiatric end.
Is that a threat?
Who's in it?
Fuck him!!!
Do you have an appointment?
Sometimes.
You're not going to drive.
Take it now.
Right, twelve years.  Couple times a month.
So maybe it's time we took a vacation from each other.
Swimming trunks.
Suit yourself.
How many?
The sooner we do this the better, Mr. Baker.
I don't see any ladies here. Except maybe you.
How's the birthday girl?
I thought maybe held gotten over that.
I had a boy down at the camera shop cut them all together.  Boy, old man Henderson didn't fool around when he gave a haircut, did he, Jack?
Out.
Two nights.
Twenty-eight years, Frank.
Like an angel.
Bosen black.  Flat.
Trust me, you're not missing anything.
What about that waitress at the Ambassador?
No thanks.
It's not family.  It's business.
We don't get a gig.
Something came up.  Don't worry, Charlie stayed true.  Both nights. I'll give you your share tomorrow. At the house.
I've tried to do well by you, Jack. By both of us.
You, Frank.  All these years you been telling me we're different.  We got novelty, Jack. No one can touch us.
It was a somewhat extraordinary day.
Let's get it over with.
It's early.
Here, how's this?
Yeah.  Something.
Come on, Jack.  It's not like it's the first time we've bunked together.  It'll be like when we were kids.  Relax.  Enjoy the view.
A few bars!
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah.  You mind?
No, that's your problem, Frank.  You get around one of these assholes and you turn into a fucking three-year-old.
Because I can hear it.
I love you.  I just wanted to say it.
I'm sorry, Frank.  All that talk about family. I just got emotional.
She's a big girl.
What?
Huh?
Drove me crazy when we were kids. The way you never looked at the music. Miss Simpson would just play it and ...
You always threw up.
A channel. It's just a little further down the dial, that's all. Look, it's publicity.  Publicity's publicity.  Right?
Look.  I didn't know when we were going to be on until yesterday.  What was I supposed to do? I had the pianos anyway.
No, fuck you.  And fuck him too. Fuck the both-of you.
This'll kill 'em.
Spur of the moment.
No, no.  You boys are tired.
All right.
Okay.  I think that's all we need to know.
That's the premise.
When we know.
We're a team.  We work together.
Time for what?
My wife wears a seven.  You don't look like a seven to me.
All right, but make it quick.  Shoes!  What size do you wear?
Uh... good.
You can buy new ones tomorrow.
Piece of cake.
Switch?  What fucking switch?
The Carlton's a dump.  No cover.  No minimum. And they water their drinks. It's strictly for the Fuller brush crowd.
We take the Avedon, right?  Simple.
First times. Hey, look at this.
Okay.The Fantasy Inn.
Smells like fish.
They must've bought the same map we did.
I don't believe it.  You're a romantic, Frank.
That'd be me, sir.  Frank Baker. This is my brother Jack.
We trust you, Lloyd.  You know that.
So. I'm here, you're here, the piano's here.  What d'ya say?
Regular hours are eight to five.
He leads, I follow.
Not for money. With my mother.
Because Blackie Carson books the Park and whenever we've needed a gig he's come through.
His kid's sick.
Yeah,well, a11 I know is mother nature must be one crazy dame.  Shit.
The Stratford.
Huh?
You want me to walk you?
I mean, that'd be too creepy. With us working together and all.
Every year.
I guess in case one year they're not.
Better than that.
Look. You don't know good. All right?
It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you.
Let's make a deal.  You shut up.
Who's Nina?
Friend?  What's she look like? Maybe I can help you find her.
How come you didn't close your eyes?
Must've been a cheap date.
Huh?
Long story.
Oh.
If our feet get hot, you grab the piano.
Yeah.  Got my own sign.
Losing his teeth.
Another five years, huh?
Is that what you used to do?
Wow.
Eddie.
... Thanks.
Sorry, Admiral.  It wasn't mentioned in the job description.
Jon, he's hooked up to a full-spectrum polygraph. No one has ever beaten --
My place.
Shut up.
You shoot hoops like a chick, you smoke like a wuss, and -- I don't know -- you're different.
You porked his wife the day he was arrested.  How could you forget that?
What's worse than losing five million bucks?
Something good?
How come?
I can't tell you ... except only I can do it.
Why point it at me?  I'm the real thing.
The left, I think.  Those surgeons in Witness Protection can fix things nobody's even broken yet.
Don't worry.  I've done my homework.  I'll get Pollux to talk.
I've been working night and day.  I haven't had time.
I just asked you about making love to your wife, and you started talking about your job.
You said it, Jon, not me.
You're under arrest. Incredibly, you still have the right to remain silent --
Let's not confuse things anymore.  I'm Archer. You're Castor.  But if you need proof --
You've given me the freedom I haven't had in years, and the power to make it pay off in ways I never thought possible.  But hell -- this is America.  One day a pauper, the next day, a prince. And I owe it all to you. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got an important government job to abuse, -- and a beautiful wife to fuck.  Excuse me -- I mean "make love to."
Not if I kill you first ...
So's a noose.  Now keep your mouth SHUT.
Pollux is -- what?
Walton, you have to let me see the warden --
Trust me, he's already here. Get going!
Yeah, mom cut me some slack -- but I decided ... I'd like to be here for you.  Here, mom.  You can have it back.  Thanks, though.
Well, I saw you -- Kim.
Escaped?  From Erewhon?  I want everyone on this -- our entire force and the SFPD.
You can't blame me for trying.
You better get used to it. That bitch Lazarro is getting kicked upstairs. Guess what white-bread family man is going to replace her?
Good, because I checked your salary -- and it bites.  How the everyday working-class stiff survives in today's economy is something I'll never ...
Me.  I have doubts about your ability to stick with what is essentially a desk job.
Done.  In fact, I was already plotting about the best way to meet the foreign bureau chiefs.
No.  Most of them are in transit by now.  I'm heading over to the hotel to personally oversee security.
What do you know about it?
Have fun at work.
So you see, I'm not going anywhere.  Unless it's upstairs with you ...
The world can wait, Jon. You're going.
Okay, I have a confession to make.  But you aren't going to like it.
That's what I'd like to know.  She stole fifty dollars from my purse and took off.
Her assistant said you could call her at home after eight.
Stop Jack, I'm getting all weepy.
Please, call me Alan. We try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here...
Uh...actually, yes. Two... good ones.
A broker? Really. And now you’re in the tire business?
Really. So you’re projecting what, a tad over two million?
What about me?
Seven.  Really.
Mommy needs five more minutes in la la land. That could be her present...
I think I could figure it out.
Sure.
Check...
Like what?
Don’t you think that’s a little gimmicky?
Mary Had A Little Lamb.
Ringing my bell...
I don’t think so.
Kate’s my wife...
I’m telling you, those rules don’t apply to me, Arn.
Hey, is that really necessary?
It’s me, Jack...
Damn, you are the real thing...
Hey...
That’s my car!  You stole my car!
What the hell is happening to me?!
Give me my goddamn life back!
I asked you a direct question!  A glimpse of what?!
How much time?!
Look, I just want my life back.  Now what’s it gonna take?  You wanna talk turkey?  Let’s talk turkey!  How much money...?
Why not?
C’mon, Jack...
You know what the word glimpse means, J? It’s by nature an impermanent thing.
Ticket bad.  You draw in lines with pencil.
Nice night for it.  I'll have Louis send your car home.
Thanks.  To you too...
What?
I was in the city.
Uh huh...
Pro bono.  You don’t get paid at all.  Nobody makes a dime.  Well, bravo...
And...?
It’s ten thirty, Jack. By eleven you’re gonna be sprawled out on the bed snoring your head off. We don’t have time for wining and dining.
No, I’m serious...you’re really stunning...
Sure.  I really like Annie.
I want it...
What...?
No, open it...
Are you sure?
And now...?
That’s a big one for me, too.
I guess...some of them are probably faking.
No, this is the center of the universe.  If I were living in Roman times, I would live in Rome, where else?  Today, America is the Roman Empire and New York is Rome itself. John Lennon.
Promise me again...
I’m moving to Paris...it was right here...  It’s a box marked “Jack.”  I put it in the stack for the Salvation Army...
Jack.
Thank you, Betty.  I know if I can just sleep this off, I’ll be fine...
Why are you staring at my breasts, Peter?
Where is he?
Do I know you?
So we'll get egg nog.
Merry Christmas...
Hey, kind of under a little pressure here.
Yes!
I wouldn't know anything about that.
This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot NASA.  And Victor's not that bad.  He's just a little...  Larger than life.
We got what we wanted.  That's <u>enough</u>.
Victor's better at these things.
Reed.  Even <u>you</u> can't compute every little thing.
I think I need to lie down.  Bad shrimp.
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
Really?  With a name like Von <u>Doom</u>? Never saw <u>that</u> one coming.
Deb, it's me.  It's still me.
I'm worried about you.
I'll schedule the launch.  Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.
Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
Oh, he did.
It's not him.  It's <u>them</u>.  I can't live like this.
Victor must've taken him.
And they're changing into...
What do you mean "complete"?
What are you trying to say?  Just because I dress well and like to dance --
They're not costumes.
Right, whatever, have fun.
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
I think that thing is Ben.
That's the temperature of the <u>sun</u>.
And if he's not...?
Recording, sir.  We see you perfectly.
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
<u>That's</u> why.  Because I could have any <u>other</u> woman... You know, when they asked Caesar "why England," he said, "because it's not <u>mine</u>."
Yes sir.  You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
Get a grip.  Reed.  We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch.  Just close the shields...
So reel him in.  But we came here to do a <u>job</u>.  So let's do it.  <u>Quickly</u>.
It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
What I <u>should</u> have done a long time ago.  Applications and patents, Reed. This all belongs to me.
Right.  That's exactly what I meant.
You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.
Passion.
What?  What do you mean you --
What about you?  You haven't eaten in days.  How come you're never on this side of the microscope?
I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
Raising the shields.
Oh, I think you already have.
Here's the overall Target Area...
That can't be -- there's no direct connection between the two --
But it's hopeless! They can't go back and they can't go on. I tell you there's nothing else we can do but remove them!
I'd hold that off awhile.
What can I do? Except maybe pass out?
We have no choice. Duval's the most skillful brain surgeon in the country, and he's right here, at hand.
That's right. He wanted us to have the secret, and not them. Which is why they tried to kill him.
And take a little trip with them...
It must have been jarred loose during the whirlpool.
I just wanted to thank you for taking me along.
He certainly is. He should be up and about in no time.
I've been with him since I got out of school. He brought me into the CMDF, over five years ago.
Depends on which end of the telescope you look through.
Well, if you happen to be very fond of him -- even in love with him -- it would certainly affect your point of view.
I don't agree. I think we ought to stop and take a sample.
A simple exchange, Mr. Grant. Corpuscles releasing carbon dioxide -- the moment they touch the Wall of the Lung -- in return for oxygen coming through from the other side.
If I can relieve the pressure on a few key vessels...
How are you, Miss Peterson?
I'm afraid there's only one thing we can do. Call off the mission.
If there's any chance --
Walt for the lull -- between the time he inhales and exhales.
They'll still be able to track us by radar, because of the radioactive fuel.
That line was tampered with...
Two in a row?
Where we going?
They can't reduce nuclear fuel. But once the Reactor's Miniaturized -- along with the submarine -- a microscopic particle should emit enough energy to activate it.
Enough to breathe, but that's all.
We can get out through the Lab Section.
Oh -- sure, sure! Never better!
Yes, by all means. We must try it.
Then don't drift down further.
It's less than one ten-thousandth of an inch thick. And porous.
Where's my daughter?
I don't think so. It's nice.
No.
The new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars.
Except that you were gonna be here at 7:30.
I'm not gonna sit here and debate. I will say this though: what Shep told us didn't make a whole lot of sense.
Personal matters.
This was s'posed to be a no-rough stuff-type deal -
GOT IT?
Oh, for Christ's sake, where's my goddamn checkbook. Let's get this over with.
End a April.
Oh, now he's adorable.
Well, okay - thank you, Detective.
I unnerstand.
Ya got that right.
And what about the other fella?
...My fee? Wade, what the heck're you talkin' about?
No, no. See - they, no, see, they only deal with me. Ya feel this, this nervousness on the phone there, they're very - these guys're dangerous -
You bet.
Ya kiddin'!
What... What is it all about?
Naw, I... Executive Sales Manager.
...Brainerd?
...Babe the Blue Ox?
I unnerstand. I'll keep it real short, then. I'm on my way out of town, but I was just - Do you mind if I sit down? I'm carrying a bit of a load here.
The car's not from our lot, ma'am.
Well, I would know. I'm the Executive Sales Manager.
Ma'am, I answered your question.
Ma'am, I answered your question.  I answered the darn - I'm cooperating here, and I...
I'm sorry, sir, I -
Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard.  You're damned hard to get on the phone.
Okay.
My patience is at an end.
Good day, sir.
Yeah, okay. Well, siddown then.  I'm Carl Showalter and this is my associate Gaear Grimsrud.
Yah, okay.
No, no. I - I'd, I'd - pay you back the principal, and interest heck, I'd go - one over prime -
Yah, but think this thing through here, Wade. Ya give 'em what they want, why wont' they let her go? You gotta listen to me on this one, Wade.
Well, I don't vouch for him.
Margie. Thought you might need a little warm-up.
Yah.
No motels registered any tan Ciera last night. But the night before, two men checked into the Blue Ox registering a Ciera and leavin' the tag space blank.
Aw, you can sleep, hon.
Aw, Norm.
Yah... Yah, yah. Geeze, Margie!
Oh, yah, couple years now. It's actually Eden Prarie - that school district. So Chief Gunderson, then! So ya went and married Norm Son-of- a-Gunderson!
No, just so I can see ya, ya know. Don't have to turn my neck.
Well, they're a good outfit.
No, I didn't...
It's okay...
Uh-huh.
Yah, is this Marge?
Norm?
What'd he say?
His wife?
No. No. They never married.  Mike's had psychiatric problems.
The day of our homicides.
Yah.
Oh. Gary's loudmouth.
We've got a -
Uh-huh.
Yah, ya think?
Had dinner at a place called the King's Table. Buffet style. It was pretty darn good.
Yah, not too bad. So it's nice up there?
Yah.
Oh, for Pete's - a course they do! Every time they raise the darned postage, people need the little stamps!
When they're stuck with a bunch a the old ones!
And this Shep Proudfoot character, he's a little darling. He's now wanted for assault and parole violation. He clobbered a neighbor of his last night and another person who could be one of your perps, and he's at large.
Well... Why don't we...
He was killed serving Project Mayhem.
Sir, you're disturbing the other patrons with your laudish behavior.
I'm not disclosed to bespeak any such information to you, nor would I, even if I had said information you want, at this juncture be able.
I'm afraid I have to insist you leave.
Six months ago, Bob's testicles were removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen.  That was where my head fit -- into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of God's as big.
Really?  Great.  Still "Remaining Men Together?"
Look at my face.
It must've been Tuesday.  he was wearing his "cornflower-blue" tie.
Yes?
Maybe I died already.  Look at my face.
Can't you give me something?
You need healthy, natural sleep. Chew valerian root and get some more exercise.
A year?  How'd you manage that?
Candy-stripe a cancer ward.  It's not my problem.
Should we?
I suppose.
I've been going to debtor's anonymous.  You want to see some truly fucked up people?
I got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar.
Please.
Tragically, they're dead.  I'm alive and I'm in poverty.  You want any?
Here.
Feel anything?
It was the smart move on her part.
Have we been talking too long?  Must we change the subject?
Can I come in?
What?
Because the answer's "yes" or because the answer's "no?"
Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds.
Then, I'll have the clam chowder... fried chicken and a baked potato with everything and a chocolate chiffon pie.
Do this for me, Marla.  Do this for me, if you never do anything else...
Okay, if that's what it takes, you'll never have to see me again.  Here... here...
Don't ask.
Yes.
I did, I think.  But, I'm okay... I'm fine...
Who do you think I am?
My suitcase was vibrating?
Look what we've accomplised.  Thirty seconds.
Pardon me?
Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list.
The "now I get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again" list.  That list.
This time maybe get a widescreen TV. You'll be occupied for weeks.
The things you own, they end up owning you.
It affords him other interesting opportunities.
In reel three, right after the courageous dog and the snooty cag -- who have celebrity voices -- eat out of a garbage can, there's the flash of Tyler's contribution...
Only a hummingbird could have caught Tyler at work.
He farted on meringue; he sneezed on braised endive; and, with creme of mushroom soup, well...
What fight?
After I graduated, I called him long distance and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "Get a job."  When I turned twenty-five, I called him and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "I don't know. Get married."
Abe Lincoln.  Big reach.  Skinny guys fight till they're burger.
I'm fine.
Oh, and my pace is more librarians.
Marla doesn't need a lover.  She needs a case worker.
She'd invaded my support groups, now she's invading my home.
Uh... nah...
Don't mention me.
Hard to imagine you in Boy Scouts.
I was going to my cave to find my power animal.
No, what you're feeling is premature enlightenment.
Fuck damnation.  Fuck redemption.  We are God's unwanted children, with no special place and no special attention, and so be it.
An expired community college student ID card.  What did you used to study, Raymond K. Hessel?
I felt like destroying something beautiful.
Look...
Tyler...
You choose your level of involvement. I won't make decisions for you.
Fuck my life.  Fuck fight club.  Fuck you and fuck Marla.  I'm sick of this.  How's that?
Why do people think I'm Tyler Durden?
What... ?
But, when you fall asleep, I do things without you...
Night jobs -- while you were sleeping.
You... you can't be serious about this.
Green?  Did you say green?
I think this is about where we came in.
It's out of our hands.  This is it.
Paraffin.
I swear on my life, I won't...
What have you left for me?
Not my mouth.  Our mouth.
It's the only way to get rid of you...
You told me you'd say that, too.
No, no.  This is a man -- this man has a name...
Death's list.  The precise order you're going to die in.
Exact order?  Then I'm next!  I was meant to die with my friends, so I'm next!
The songs on the radio.  But wait.  I don't understand.  Why is this even happening to me?
You were there?
So if you give us the pregnant lady's number, we can warn her about the lake and she'll live long enough to have the baby.
What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn?
And when it was Rory's turn to die, and Thomas was in the way?
Holy shit.  He said "only new life can defeat death."  If she gives birth to a baby that was never meant to be born, a brand new soul that was never part of Death's Design...
Blow me.
Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimberly.
Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimmy.
Evan Shaeffer's dead.  Guess he wasn't as lucky as we thought.
Yeah, I hate to love and leave ya, but I've been over this X-Files shit since the sixth season.
Yeah, so what happened?
Like what?
Clean up?  I don't...
How do you know?
That's crazy.  You can't give up now.  We can still fight this thing.
No, I'm good.
Get ready to smile, five guys per girl.
There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die, all of us, I saw it!
I...I don't know.
I know, honey.  I just --
I know, Dad.
Hey, Dad.  What's up?
You got it, Dad.  I'll call you if I have a problem.
What feeling?
I love you too, Dad.  Goodnight.
Jeez, Mom, stop trippin'.
Yeah?
It is. But that didn't stop me. Shouldn't stop you.
What if Tod... is just the first... of us?
Right. April 25th.
Most kids never have it happen.
They blame me for everything. Her, Tod, the plane crash...
Why do you think I was hiding?
Dude, get wisdom. We're about to board a seven hour flight. The toilets in coach are barely ventilated closets. What if your body wants that airplane food out of your system and you have to go torque a wicked cable and then right after you walks in Christa or Blake?  You want them to associate with you with that reflexive gag and the watery sting in their eyes?
Me, right? That's why you're not saying.
That's right, buddy.
Put it in the guard's barracks.  Man they got pissed.  They beat the crap out of me, but... it's kind of a tradition.  You oughta see 'em run around.
Really?  How come he didn't take me?
One hundred.
Yeah.  Second set.  Let's go.
Buddhist monastery.  Fifteenth century.
Guard barracks.  Take some shots.
Alright.  Home run.
Bastards.  Let's get some shots.
Ain't you coming with us, sweet thing?
It's a Soviet MIL MI-24.  Probably has 12.7mm nose cannon, heat-seeking rockets and wire guided missiles, plus...
I go up to this camp two months ago. Nobody there.  Empty for years.
Spooks?
Carefully.  Don't want to get shot by you.  Bad karma.  Anyway, you need me.
Yeah.  Got some business there. What are you gonna do?
Minigun.  Come on.  Let's move. He's coming in on our open side.
Sorry, Sir.  Can't do it.
Not yet.
That's right.
I know.
American.  Come to get you out.
De Fravio.  Dave De Fravio. Lieutenant... Air Force.
But now it's free, right?
It's an awful thing, let me tell you. My Aunt used to say,  "divorce is the sister-in-law of death".
I mean, it's not easy in this day and age.
Meeting ... people.
I don't understand you. What is the problem?
Hey? What did I tell you? Why don't you come? It's just dinner. You'll have something to tell your mother next time she calls.
Got any more bread crust?
Why this is outrageous!...
<u>What are you, out of your mind</u>!
Huh...the restaurant's just around the corner here...
Anne, they're MY moods. If you want to understand moods, have one of your own!
I... I stayed at a friend's.  Listen, I --
And who's Lydia?
What?  The curse'll be lifted?  <u>Will</u> <u>you please</u>!
He just needs some clothes?
He says if I want to get back to work, no problem.  He wants me to come in and talk and... and... <u>that's</u> <u>it</u>!
"I'm an incredible woman?"  What is this, a death sentence?
I didn't know.  I just said all I want is some time.
I... I... went to this bar... this very, ya know -- hard-to-get-in place... called Babbitt's...
She gave you the old brusheroo, kiddo... Believe me -- this tart will never make it to your desert plate...
Tragedy?
Come on...maybe we can...where do you want to go?
I'm a man with a mission, Jack.
NO...I WANNA GO! I WANNA GO NOW!
Well, congratulations Lydia, because out of several thousand card holders... in conjunction with several major credit card companies...
Well..um...you get an official membership card...  Just sign that and we'll laminate it right here... Parry?  You want to laminate Miss Sinclair's card?...
No... no... that's all right... I thought I knew her... Thanks...
"OH beings blind! What ignorance besets you!
I know a great place.  ...UH...WARREN!
Great place huh?
My name is Parry.
I'm the one what?
But I need help and <u>they</u> sent you.
They work for Him.
Oh, please... you're embarrassing me.
Parry... I'm Jack.
Thanks a mill --  And I'll give you a buzz as soon as I hear from the people upstairs and we'll get this thing off the ground... Thanks for stopping by, Jack.  Give my love to the wife and kids.
Huh-huh. I'm deeply smitten.
I don't know.
Can I take you to lunch?
WHO! WHO'S RUNNING?!! WHO HAVE WE BEEN CHASING!?? CAN I ASK THIS QUESTION NOW!!!
The Red Knight!
It's a classic.
Have you ever done any cloudbusting? You lie on your back and you concentrate on the clouds...and you try yo break them apart with your mind. It's wild.
Bingo!
Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything...
No. Nothing bad's going to happen. Anne'll be there. I'll be there. Nothing bad will happen.
I know!
Yeah.....Hey they're moving....  Am I doing that?
OWW...MAN...
It sounds exciting.
Well - empires have fallen because of trashy romances...
There isn't any more to tell.
You don't have to say that.
And then we'll exchange phone numbers and you'll leave and never call and I'll go to work and feel great for the first hour and then slowly turn into a piece of dirt by lunch.  Why am I putting myself through this?  It was very nice... uh meeting you. Good night..
You're married.
A wig?
Okay. Go ahead. I'll settle up for the beers...  An' walk Rayette over with you, will you.
Look at these assholes! What the hell are they doing?!
I got accused a robbin' a fillin'station down in the Indian Nation, didn' I tell you...
Well, lemme play the other side then.
Right. Now show me a little somethin' this time, okay? Give me some form...
Shut up! All of you!
No.
Who said I was depressed?
I don't, huh?
You're lucky no one was hurt.
Who?
No. How much do I owe you?
I know what it comes with, but that's not what I want.
Yeah. I want you to hold it between your knees.
That's good.
You know who it once belonged to?
Everybody still up on the Island?
Wait...
Yeah, me, too...
No, I don't really think you're a freak.
Where's Catherine?!
Nothing? Then it must be very boring for you here.
I'm not conscious of having given you any meaningful looks. And as for the day after tomorrow, this is the day after tomorrow, and I am, unfortunately, seeing you... Now if you'll excuse me, I'd like to take a bath.
No, you don't have to, it isn't necessary...
Just give me a chance, will you?
Yes.
No, the last time was three years ago.
All right, let's have a rematch.
Robert, let's not be rude, okay?
Well, I was goin' to, but Bobby said he hadda kind of feel things up here first, which I can understand, but then it went an' took so long, I ran flat outa money...  I didn't have no number to call, you know.  So I hadda clear outa there an' come on up here, in the hopes that I wouldn't be intrudin' myself...
Jesus, what a rude person...
In my personal thing, I don't see that. I'm seeing more filth. A lot of filth. What they need to do every day, no, once in a while, is a cockroach thing, where they spray the homes. And uh... can you imagine, if their doors were painted a pretty color, and they had a pot outside, with...
The TV. There's some good things on it, sometimes.
Well, she was.
Oh... I'm sorry. Was I singing again?
Why you have an attitude for?
Now she's tellin' me what the fuck to do.
Then I want you to go to whoever's sayin' that and tell them to stop.
Hi.
Of course.
I buy them flowers.
I did.
Yo, Carlos-I'm gonna punch you.
I can't man, I'm punished!
C'mon.
'Cause you know what, you're not supposed to know but yesterday she lent me her pills for her Moms and if I don't give 'em to her she's gonna die. You want her to die?
How old is he?
You gonna talk to him?
Yo, I know what you're thinking, that I'm one of those guys that keep coming up to her.
So, then whadda ya want?
Utah?  Jesus Christ! First of all, Alan Stanwyk does not own one share of stock.The three million dollars for the ranch in Provo comes from my daughter who converted some of her personal holdings, not company holdings. Now if anybody in DC wants to make something of that, bring 'em on. Until then, get the hell out of my face.
You're kidding.
Sally Ann Cavanaugh. Oh wait, she couldn't work in your office, she's not from around here.
Sonofabitch.
Fletch, this is dumb.
I busted their window, they didn't do anything.
You should have seen what she wanted to do with the place. Mauve.  So what's your name?
Frankly sir, you look a little like my father. Probably explains the curious feeling of love I have for you.
I'm about to break that beach wide open, and I don't need some pennyante Woodward and Bernstein getting in the way of my men.
My God, you're serious.
Its been very nice meeting you. I enjoy your column.
That's Babar.
One. B-a-b-a-r.
But not right next to each other. I thought that's what you meant.
I don't know. I don't have any.
Your aunt?
I'll bet. Shame about Ed.
Oh, he was dying for years.
Tell the nurse when you've got a few free days. She'll make all the arrangements.
Okay. Some idea.
Affirmative.
I'm gonna nail the chief. And you can help or --
Wait five minutes, and go to my office. You'll get federal protection after that.
Gum thought Brazil.
I hate to conduct business on the lanai. Why don't we step inside.
I like your outfit. You got the fifty grand and the plane ticket?
Harry S. Truman?
Isn't that nice. Good man. Showed the Japs a thing or two.
They bust you every week.
What's that?
I didn't sell nothing! I didn't sell nothing! I just carried the drugs from the Chief to Sam.
Fletch, I never sold nothing.
I want it done Thursday evening, around eight PM. My wife will be off to the club for a committee meeting. It's the staff's night off.  These will be open.
Get me on the first shot, if you can.
Take it where?
They serve dinner on the flight?
Can I steal you for a minute?
Not our kind of people, you understand.
That's okay, Lar. I gotta put this on the back burner for a while.
You kidding? I got an unbelievable story here, Lar. Un-believable. Jesus. It's the cops, I know it. The Chief! And they're all over Frank.
Check every hotel in L.A. Start with the ones near the airport. Yeah. He's about to leave the country with her. Thanks, Lar.
I'm sorry?
Oh, we've got lots of pictures. Let me show you some.
No, thank you.
Oh, mine! Thank God.  Actually, that doesn't make it any better, does it? Are you a friend of Alan's?
John Ultrarelamensky.
I can't figure out why I went to Utah for the morning.
Hi.
Yes.
Just like Alan. It's freaky.
Depends on the question.
Because I'm bored. Oh, that sounds terrible, doesn't it. I'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better, I also let you in because I'm hungry.
He never sees them and I never met them.
I think you should call me Gail, now.
Yeah.
I'm talking about how much I'd like to take you to a Laker game.
But first I called the Hall of Records in Provo. They checked on the deed. You're telling the truth. A minute later Alan came in the room and asked me why I was shaking.
Gail, please.
I checked. There was no divorce.
I'm telling you he's not your husband at all.
Don't ever call me 'Irwin,' okay?
Who are you?
I'm her cousin.
Frank, you look a little peaked. Wanna vomit?
Irwin...
Irwin, professional journalism time, now. Go back to the goddamn beach and finish the goddamn story!
No it's not okay. You have to have this in by tomorrow. Did you see the ad we ran Sunday?
Why not? Oh shit... really?
You broke it? You know the source?
I have pictures of him. Dealing...
You know, I've had it up to here with your bullshit. I need a story from you by tomorrow.
I want something I can print!
I'm sick of this place. I'm going to try out for the Lakers. They need a power forward.
My secretary.
I said, I ain't got you...
Excuse me?
Yeah, but of course for now, I only get a twenty.
Oh... I have some questions.
So you...
Thanks for the information. Appreciate it.
Man, ever since old Jack Grendel died, Julian has got me into one yummy gig after the other.  Not only am I producing, he's got me in some lovely-bullshit-money-money executive position.  What are you looking at...
Right away!
'Bye Ford...'  Hey, let me cheer you up.  I found the IN X S payment.
I love you, too, baby.  He wants to meet at six.  What time is it now?
Ah -- ha... You know, you should think about dating Earthmen again.
Keep it.  It's your paycheck this month.
I found a lot of Art Mooneys. None with a police record, though. Not even Synchronicity.  Have you checked out Johnny Pinzolo/Crunch's houseboat yet?
Shut up, goodies from the ice queen.
Make eye contact when you say that.
How much?
It's Spunk Lewis, the lead singer for Dead Ribbit!  Mr. Bus Driver, stop!
No.  Who's Art Mooney?
Friends?  You didn't tell me that.
Stop.  We still got serious detective stuff to do, but we've been up all night so we should hit the sack for...
Ford, do you got something cooking in the microwave?
Zuzu, be quiet.  Put in Colleen's disc.  Number two.
Sorry, it was dark, now come on.
No, wait...
ArtArtArtArtMooneyMooneyMooney Mooney.
Tell me, Dr. Watson, what makes you think he's not just another piece of shit overdose.
I'll give you a gut feeling, you little... Hey... <u>hey</u>!  Get that stick out of your mouth.  These things are killers, man.  Don't you go to school, listen to Smokey the Bear and all that...
Well what is it?  I'm not Kreskin.
Hey, you, get off my cloud.  I'm talking to my friend.  1962 Fender Stratocaster with original humbucking pick-ups, maple neck, strung upside down for a left- handed motherfucking genius... Jimi Hendrix.
Good news is that yeah, I found him.  The bad news is...
What kind of sentimental bullshit is this?
Shut the heck up... Pop.
You think you're so hot just because you can get into any club. You think you're so hot, just because you have sex with great- looking women.  You think you're so hot just because you broke the Ensenada tape piracy ring...
Why shucks, Lt. Anus, you told me to get the fuck out of here...
Fine!
Boing.  You're one hell of a lip reader.
Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
It's 7:30.  You really should get a watch.
I'm running a little late.  You see, I'm having a party at <u>THE</u> Club to introduce the new lead singer for Black Vomit.  Everyone in the industry will be there, including our friend, Don Cleveland.
Oh, wait.  One sec.  Open the window.
Ciao.
Only on a first name basis.
I'll tell you when somebody pays me to give a shit and stuff.
I don't take cases with foundations in bullshit.  They are very hard to walk around in.
Zuzu Petals.  Sounds like a drug. A lethal one.
Doyle.
What?
Goodbye.
You must take me for an imbecile. Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington?  I haven't spent five minutes in New York City without the company of a gendarme.
Encore du sho ping!
Il fallait le faire.
He is not wrong.
Most New Yorkers never notice it - most Americans have never heard of it.
Names.
Where from?
You want some eggs.
A piece of ass wouldn't kill me.
The Westbury?  Balls.  I got him down at the subway at Times Square. What the hell's goin' on?  I make him coming right out of the hotel free as a bird.  Not a soul awake.
Walter, I can make this case if the Feds will get the hell out of my way.
How'd I know he had a knife.
There's about a hundred years' parole time in there night or day.
Tell everybody we'll be back in an hour.
This could be it, Walter.  This Candy Store guy, putting on a big show in a fancy nightclub with known connections all over him. Then on our own, after working the whole day and night, we tail him out to Brooklyn and sit on him for a week practically, and who do we come up with?  Joel Weinstock.  You gotta let us have it.
Yeah.
The other guy's a frog too.  Checked in at the Edison.  Had a hooker sent up.
This is my case.  Get these guys off my back and let me handle it.
Third time around.
For garbage?
I been damn careful up to now.
You know what I'm saying.
So what?
Yeah.
That's Deleon and Hayes' collar.
Just missed Deleon.  Hayes is up in the squad.
No, I think he's up in interrogation.
Switches are shorted out.
Baltimore?
Then fuckin' find it.  I'm going for the girl.
You didn't marry Donna Reed.
Did he?
It was under control, Bud.  Butchy's just getting tight in his old age.
I know.  He loves that thing.
The future guy?
Frank...
Hello, Frank.
John, hold on a second.  I'm in the middle of something important here.  You mind if...
Let's go.  Do us both a favor.
Okay, okay.  I need to go say something to Julia and finish up with the guy on the radio.
Wait...
WB2YKXB, who've I got?
I thought these things were for talkin' around the world.
I don't really follow baseball anymore.
This afternoon?
What the hell does Gordy have to do with it?
What?
What?
What's happening?
What if it's not...
1998.
I'm trying to be, Dad.  I'm tyrin'.  It's good to hear your voice.  I missed you...so much.
It's okay.  I'm still here, Chief.
Fire.
Tomorrow.  Jesus...it hasn't happened. It doesn't have to happen.
It's Mom.
She's not here.
He didn't just kill three women anymore. He killed ten.
Something we did changed the case...changed history.  Mom wasn't dead.  But then after you didn't die in the fire something must have happened.  And this guy, this Nightingale guy, he kept on killing...it was like a spree...seven more women.
They will if they catch him in the act. You can make that happen, Dad.  You can tail the victim and call it in at just the right moment.
Did you see him?  Do you know who he is?
Dad, I think I may be able to get you enough information to make sure the DA can nail this bastard.
Didn't happen, we got enough problems down here.
Well, game five was the big one.  It turned in the bottom of the 6th.  We were down 3-0.  Cleon Jones gets hit on the foot - left a scuff mark on the ball. Clendenon comes up.  The count goes to 2 2.  High fastball.  He nailed it.  Weis slammed a solo shot in the 7th to tie. Jones and Swoboda scored in the 8th.  We won, Pop.
But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember?
No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license.
What...
Okay, okay...
Right, now I need you to tape it up on the outside, where he touched it, so the prints keep.
What the hell is that smell?
Better.
Fire?  What are you talking about?  He had cancer, John.
That wasn't luck, Johnny boy.  That was smarts and ten plus on the job.
April 16...?  That means she was the first.
Mind if I shake it off first...so's I can concentrate better.
Uh, huh.
Yeah.  Sure.
No kidd'n, he musta been pushing 90!
Yeah.  I just wish I'd told her how proud I was of her.
No.  No.  Well, sort of.  In my heart. Been dead 29 years.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
"He" wanted me to warn you.  Look at this, all of you!
Yes, you can.  Come on, Shelly!
I think it's called "a shower". You might try it sometime.
Barely.
Sure.
Nothin'.  I was just foolin' around.
It's the last house on the left. She lives downstairs.
Is that so bad?
Did you stay here last night?
Sort of.
You're Shelly?
Destroy the evidence, Pronto!
Come on, Shelly.  Who else is gonna give him a lift?
May be please have the wallet.
Yes.
Maybe.
Just keep your eyes on the road.
Stop the car!  Now!!
Look at it this way... things can only get better... Right?
A few minor repairs and it'll be as good as new.
Damn you, Shelly!
Great.  Just great.
Alright, alright.
Well, who told me to take this cow path?
I admit nothing without talking to my lawyer.
Why?
That's a freakin' fact.  Least of all us.
Now wait a second!  I thought Burt shot you.
My ass.
Megan, take your friends back to the camp.  I'll let you know if I hear anything about your counselors.
When you stop acting like one... Tommy Jarvis is a very sick boy. And you...
Tommy, my father is out looking for you right now.  Something happened tonight and he's sure you're responsible.  If he finds you, he'll...
Come and get it.
It probably wouldn't have any effect on him.  The only sure way to stop Jason is to return him to his original resting place, where he drowned in 1957.
Did you hear me?!
No, he was real.  Like on TV.
Who ya calling?
All the little kids arrive today. We're not ready to deal with that alone.
Will you listen, dammit!
Yes, but they released me because...
They were gonna!  But some asshole sent a lot of money to give Jason and his mother a decent burial. Now look, you just lie down and get some rest.  In the morning I'll call that clinic and see if they...
Jason's not in his coffin!  Hawes is!  Dig it up!  You gotta dig it up!!
Yeah...They should've paid their bill.
Yeah, that'd be a big shame...
-- yeah, yeah, yeah.  You just have your hundred grand ready.  For that you get the machete...the mask...the whole damn thing.
The what?
I'm here.
Maybe you should mind your own business.
Why don't you blow me, Chief.  After your girlfriend gets through.
That's what I'd like to know.
Information like that is very expensive and you don't have the balls to pay the price.
You think you can lock me up in this piss-ass prison?  Hell, this place is motel fuckin' six to me.
I mean, how can you go through life without never having made a prank call?
Showing Vicki what she missed out on by being such a dull kid.  Now, the first thing you need in making a prank call is, of course, a phone.  This one, for instance.
Yeah...
Okay.
What am I gonna do -- I'm locked up in a friggin' cell?!
Okay.
Until I hear the truth.
The truth?  That Josh, a man I've trusted with my own life on more than one occasion -- let me see if I've got the order right here -- tried to rape Diana...got the back of his head blown off...took a poker through the gut...fell through a plate glass window and then magically disappeared into the night.
No -- she left me!  After her miscarriage, I --
No. And I'm not losing any sleep over it.
So what else is new?  Look Eva, you're asking the wrong dude to feel sorry for Tamara Mason. Wise up -- it's not hip to be her friend.
Really?
What? Don't be a lightweight...this is top dollar toot.
You're talking to the prom queen, Eva. Do you really think I'm going to risk getting caught?
Yeah.
Never mind, you don't want to know about it.
No.
Nothing.
And neither do you. It's up to Rennie to decide what she wants to do.
And she sure doesn't have one now, either. She needs to live.
Oh, I can see that. You've done a wonderful job of supervising the kids, Miss Van Deusen.
Walking corpses are not real!
She's locked safe in her room, no thanks to either of you.  Has he brought it back on course yet?
He's the son of the Captain, for Chrissakes. You'd think he'd be able to operate this thing!
What are you talking about?
A wonderful choice of places to dock a boat, Mr. Robertson.
Perfect for a swim, isn't it?
I'll take some lessons this time. I promise.
You're telling a lie.
I'm staying.
But Sean said...
I refuse to discuss this ridiculous notion that a ghoul is terrorizing this ship.
I was only trying to teach you. But I pulled you out, Rennie. I saved your life.
Just felt a little chill.
Have you seen my dog anywhere?
There's something I haven't told you...
Whenever I get near the water, I see this young boy drowning. He tries to pull me down with him.
No. It was just a normal summer. I've never been able to figure it out.
What is your location?
Where are they?
I'm not going near any lifeboat!
I'm not!!
Very big.
Alla puttanesca.
I don't want to hear about it.
It's over, finished and done with.
Do not inhale.
What do I exude?
You will suffer because he is in the theater. And you will suffer a thousandfold when his review appears.
It is just a review. Do not inhale. Very dangerous.
Here we go.
Let's work on it.
This could be it.
Does what feel comfortable?
I talked to her two days ago.
Can he get through it?
I've got bigger problems, Joanna. Personal problems.
They can send their heartless brilliant boy-critic. There's a much bigger thing going on than tonight's opening.
Three games to two. But if you know their history, you realize there's a tragedy in the making. I've been carrying this franchise on my back since I was six years old.
The Red Sox blow a chance to win their first World Series since 1918. You expect me to miss that for an opening night?
I go to college. I thought you knew.
Don't call her Mother all the time. It makes her sound tragic and unforgiving. What happened to Mom?
I'm not sure.
Everything.
Daddy, wait.
It's only our first date.
A flat-out hit.
We're strangers in the night. The last thing we want is honesty.
Mystery. Deception.
Yes.
An artistry and sensitivity you've never shown before.
And Peter Redmond helped immensely. These pauses were exquisitely timed. He made us wait and wait. He built a gorgeous tension and suspense.
We stranded five runners in the first two innings. This will come back to haunt us.
I respect a kid who does his homework in a taxi. But let's put a lid on the questions.
I don't know if I can say that.
What did it say?
I'm at the door.
Pop, will you let me in?
Right here. At the door.
It's me. Nicky.
You know the answer to that.
The Red Sox are your problem. I never understood about you and the Red Sox. Everybody rooted for the Yankees.
Don't make me sit through one of your plays.
I can't find it.
Oh yeah?
Life is good.
Because God loves a winner.
This could be it!
Why does it matter?
Why do you care?
When I traveled through Asia this summer, I went to tremendous trouble and expense to rent a car with a phone so I could call up Sports Phone in New York and get the scores. I drove through the war in Afghanistan calling Sports Phone like every hour on the hour, for updates.
You're out of bullets.
Sidney.
I can see her face so clearly. Dear God. My heart was flying out of my chest with love.
Not one of Steven's finer moments.
A little.
He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
Engaging.
The fact is, I have to get going.
Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone.
So everything. That's so what. So I begin to hate him. So I want to do him grave harm.
The truth is never gentle. Listen to me carefully. Each of us lives in the thinnest possible wrapping of wishes and dreams. Truth is the force that penetrates this wispy skin. It hurts and maims.
Are you sure?
Everyone takes his turn.
Eleven.
I'm sorry.
Yes. I've -- I've met some very remarkable people in India... and -- and when I read what you've been doing here, I -- I wanted to help.  Does that surprise you?
Ah, but my puritanism runs the another way. I'm far too modest for such a display.
Back in South Africa...  long time ago.
Lots of hair... and a little like a college freshman -- trying to figure everything out.
No, no -- just a moment, please.
The Government's afraid, and they don't know what to do. But they're more afraid of terrorists than of you. The Viceroy has agreed to your release if you will speak for non- violence.
I hope not.
A great deal.
Good.  Ba will have to teach you to spin too.
An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.  We must stop.
I'm hardly that, Mr. Patel.
Well, I've called you here because I've had a chance to see the new legislation. It's exactly what was rumored. Arrest without warrant. Automatic imprisonment for possession of materials considered seditious...
That was England.
I can. But I risk being kicked into the gutter by someone less "holy" than Mr. Baker.
My wife publicly defied the law. They've arrested her and four others.
Who's leading them?
Have you found him?
Er, no...
Don't worry.  You'll probably do just as well singing to him in the womb.  We can implant the most successful pre-embryo tomorrow afternoon.
--I've already run it.  There's no record of any living relative.
A customer?  Does this Michael's cater to misfits?
It is hard to believe he could be one of their elite workers.  You've seen their security system.  They know who works there.  Even if you ignore the man's expiration date, his profile suggests that he doesn't have the mathematical propensity let alone the stamina to pass their physicals.
None of the ID photos match the enhancement.
Where did you get this?
Jerome--?
What's wrong with him?
Wrong color.  It's silver.  It's not easy living up to this.
Leave?  Just a few million years ago every atom in this hair--in our bodies--was a part of a star. I don't see it as leaving.  I see it as going home.
He was still warm when they confirmed.
Hey, how much of you can be there?  Even if the "J. Edgars" do find something, in a week--  you'll be slightly out of their jurisdiction.  Come on, we've got to get drunk immediately.
Keep going!!  Keep going!!
I still can't believe they're sending you to the Belt--you of all people--never meant to be born, on a mission to discover the origin of life.
It's okay, Eugene.
--What car?--Go to sleep.
In a corridor.
I'm sorry.  I think I was crying.
You're the one who said not to change anything. She's my ear to the investigation.
Good choice.
Michael's.
How long?
We want him--we were hoping he would get married and have children.  We'd like grandchildren.
How do I square the accident?
I'd have to bleach my hair.
Even with lifts I'm never that tall.
We were just looking.
Just some In-Valid.  Vincent--  --somebody.
Let's walk.
It's not safe.  I shouldn't have brought you here.
Come on.
I forgot something--something at home. I'll see you later.
Only every time I'm in here.
I'm not doing it.
Not at all, just a pleasant way to have lunch.
This is the only time you and I meet in public. Any business with me, handle it with him...
They're mine. The one with the moustache is my brother. They stay out of it. We stay clean.
I heard about you. You work with Miller.
They may nail me into this now, McCoy.
I knew that life didn't add up to the obvious when I was 8.
So we did that crackerbox... to cover for you.
I've been doing my homework.
Just the way I remembered.
Pretty good... Made a quick trip to Oregon, saw my brother and the kids. Figured it would be my last chance, unless they wanted to travel.
Nothing's been boring since you found me.
Better than I remembered.
Is he straight?
If we are clean Gollie will take us over at Nogales. If we are hot we'll have to try Laughlin at El Paso.
That bad?
Waiting's hard. You never learn how.
At least you were outside.
There are three men dead.
He might be ready to chop us up.
There wasn't any way to explain it.
You sent me to him.
You bastard...
You don't like the way things are, I don't like the way things
Maybe we should split up... I'll cut the money with you.
You've got all the answers. What about when they find the body on the train?
No... there's a couple of things I'm still working on.
If Beynon bought him out, and he talked then maybe Beynon's boys will be waiting for us in El Paso.
Let's do it.
El Paso.
It's all a game, don't bother me.
I don't want to hear it.
We've come a lot of miles. But we're not close to anything.
Oh, Jesus... how?
I'll be ready.
Get your clothes on, move your butt.
Who was it?
Yeah, why not? We're the good guys.
Me, too. Got twenty-four days of furlough and I'm goin' home.
Utah, the Bee-Hive state. I'm from Orem, right near Salt Lake ... Say, you wouldn't happen to be a Mormon, would you?
What about you?
Whatever you need.
Suit yourself.
I kinda doubt it.
Not now.
What's it to you?
And I keep my mouth shut?
Just... tell us what you want.
A Ford... We have a Ford.
That's not possible. We can't leave here... we've got all this.
And you told Brumby?
Last Sunday afternoon, Eric and two of his boys arrive with Frank and tell me that he's rumbled. Somehow, he's seen the film and was about to shoot his mouth off. They ask me for some whisky and start forcing it down his throat.  I thought they'd just duff him up a bit. Honest.
Nothing. What could I do?
'Good.'
What happened to this car?
You must be joking,  Keep him away from the telephone. I'm going out for a bit.
Doreen.
Killed?  I don't know anything about it.
Once a week?
He wanted me to leave Dave and marry him. Last Friday I told him it wouldn't work. Dave would have killed us both!  He followed me home and kicked up a stink in the street,  I had to tell Frank I couldn't see him any more. It was getting too dodgy. That was on Sunday.  He said he'd kill himself. I was frightened what you might do.
I work for him.
Who?
No.
Of course. Where else?
Don't worry. He's meeting the architects at the restaurant.
Now you're asking.
Especially when I play the lead.
Yeah. A bloody funny thing!
Don't worry. She's bound to be upset.
Frank was a good bloke. It's the least I could have done.
Why would it?
Since when did he drink whisky?
Yes.
I'll bet this one's seen some action.
I'm sorry.
Pension him off.
How could I stay away?
What are you doing? Advertising Martini?
Yeah,  Come off it, Eric. Who is it?
And you should know, if I remember rightly.
Can't say I do.
Not till I'm dead, Eric.
Sod off.
Still got your sense of humour.
Yeah.
But they have to be diplomatic.
They do that up North.
Harry! Jack, I don't want to be rude, but these men have brought a lot of money with them. Glenda, you don't offer a man like Jack a drink in those piddling little glasses.  Give him the bloody bottle.  Now, where are we?
You're bluffing, you bastard!
Calling my bluff, are you, Harry?
Shut up.
...they hold on to their money...
I...I don't know.
What?
They came in and they, you know...
It's too...
You get a bad month, all of a...
Yes.
Himself?
No, it's not that simple, Dave...
No.
You...
What could we get for them?  I don't know.  Buck a throw...buck-a- half a throw...I don't know...Hey, who knows what they're worth, what do they pay for them?  All told...must be, I'd... three bucks a throw...I don't know.
We're just speaking about it.  As an idea.
No.  Not actually.
What did he say?
What will he pay?
What does that mean?
Yes.  I'm sure.
Then tough luck, George, because you are.
You went for it.
I don't...yes.  Okay, the board.
That's...
They stole the...
Down the street.
Yeah.  That's swell.  Another waste of time.
No.
Where was I?
No.
No.
Just go to lunch.
Excuse me...
...did they...
Don't fuck with me, fella.  I'm talking about a fuckin' Cadillac car that you owe me...
Who are you?
Who told me wh...?  You've got a fuckin', you've...a...who is this...?  You've got a board-up on the window...Moss told me.
How the fuck do I know?  What...talk to me.
Would you excuse us, please.
They took the typewriters, they took the leads, they took the cash, they took the contracts...
Levene!!
Yes, I have a problem.  Yes, I do, my fr...It's not me that ripped the joint off, I'm doing business. I'll be with you in a while.  You got it...?  Where are you going?
You're done, come down, and let's...
...you want to see the court records?  John?  Eh?  You want to go down...
It isn't me...
...after the thirtieth...
You know what those leads cost?
Murray said...
Will you please wait a second. Shelly.  Please.  Murray told me: the hot leads...
And what if you don't close.
And fifty bucks a lead.
Now.  Yes...When?
You fucking asshole.  I haven't got it.  I haven't got it, John.  I'll pay you tomorrow.  I'm coming in here with the sales, I'll pay you tomorrow.  I haven't got it, when I pay, the gas...I get back the hotel, I'll bring it in tomorrow.
I have to go... 
You want something off the B list?
Somebody broke in.
The leads are coming.
It's better than a good sale.  It's a...
All that I'm telling you: that one thing you can tell them it's a remarkable sale.
What does that fucking mean?
You can't think on your feet you should keep your mouth closed.  You hear me?  I'm talking to you. Do you hear me...?
You can't learn that in an office. Eh?  He's right.  You have to learn it on the streets.  You can't buy that.  You have to live it.
Yes.  Mmm.  Yes.  Precisely. Precisely. 'Cause your partner depends on it.  I'm talking to you, I'm trying to tell you something.
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
You're so full of shit.
I...
How much did you get for them?  How much did you get for them?
That was easy, wasn't it?
I want to tell you something, Shelly.  You have a big mouth.
You've got a big mouth, and now I'm going to show you an even bigger one. 
Only the beginning...
Call up the bank.  I called them.
Fuck you.
Eighty-two thousand dollars.
My ass.  I told 'em.  Listen to this: I said...
"...you have to believe in yourself..."
"'Why?  Why don't I get the opportunities...?"
Shut the fuck up.  Ricky.  You have a mean streak in you...  And what the fuck are you babbling about...? 
You sold eight Mountain View?
That's right.
That's what I'm saying.  The old ways.  The old ways...convert the motherfucker...sell him...sell him... make him sign the check.  The...Bruce, Harriet...the kitchen, blah: they got their money in government bonds...I say fuck it, we're going to go the whole route. I plat it out eight units.  Eighty- two grand.  I tell them. "This is now.  This is that thing that you've been dreaming of, you're going to find that suitcase on the train, the guy comes in the door, the bag that's full of money.  This is it, Harriett..."
Bruce..."I don't want to fuck around with you.  I don't want to go round this, and pussyfoot around the thing, you have to look back on this.  I do, too.  I came here to do good for you and me.  For both of us.  Why take an interim position? 
Like you taught me...
...and you don't remember. 'Cause you weren't around.  That's cold calling.  Walk up to the door.  I don't even know their name.  I'm selling something they don't even want.  You talk about soft sell... before we had a name for it...before we called it anything, we did it.
I just put Jim into Black Creek...are you acquainted with...
Sure.
No, his wife is.
Twelve-fifteen.
Oh, my God, you're right!  I'm on the one...  Well, let's scoot...
Kenilworth.
I'm coming, Ray...what a day!  I'll call you this evening, Jim.  I'm sorry you had to come in...Monday, lunch.
Mmmm...
That's what they are.  Three business...I wait till Monday, my time limit runs out.
Yest...
She told me I have to.
I...
This.
She told me not to talk to you.
Not to my knowledge, no...
What, they beat you with a rubber bat?
You did that?
Who said "Fuck the Machine"?
Who's my pal...?  And what are you, Ricky, huh, what are you, Bishop Sheean?  Who the fuck are you, Mr. Slick...?  What are you, friend to the workingman?  Big deal.  Fuck you, you got the memory a fuckin' fly.  I never liked you.
Yes.
To the restaura...what do you fucking...?
Oh.  Oh.  Oh, your "nostalgia" file, they's fine.  No.  Swell. 'Cause I don't have to...
If you don't want it, give it back.
The word from Murray is: leave them alone.  If we need a new signature he'll go out himself, he'll be the president, just come in, from out of town...
Three.
Mr. Lingk and I are going to...
It was nothing...I was assuring Mr. Lingk...
John...
Your check as cashed yesterday afternoon.  And we're completely insured, as you know, in any case.
I was taller than you when I was fourteen.
I'm not hungry.
I got surprises for everybody!
Why do you come to me?  Why don't you go to a travel agent?
Because I need MONEY!
A hundred years...it's a toast.
Dancing is alright; you're falling on the floor.
He will grow strong.
But thank you for speaking to me as a Godfather.
Get a good night's sleep.  We got a new suit, new shirt, new tie, and I'm going to shave you myself. Tomorrow we want you to look respectable for fifty million of your fellow Americans.
We have a special home for you for the rest of your life.  Nobody gets near you.  You're not going any place.
I didn't turn against nobody; he turned against me.
Let's go.
Johnny Ola... Hyman Roth.
You know otherwise, Freddie?
What's that?
...Who?
What do you want me to do?
What is it?  Can I help?
Nowhere, Mike.  I wanted to get a refill.  How about you?
What about now, is there anything you can help me out with?
I've always taken care of you.
Because he knows them; he knows they have no one to protect them. Vitone?  What do you think of my angel?
Why?
Chi?
Am I a prisoner?
Kay... Kay...
You don't know that's true.  But Kay, just for the sake of an argument, let's assume it is, I'm not saying it is, remember, but... What if I gave you what might be some justification for what he did... or rather some possible justification for what he possibly did.
Okay, just hear me out.  What if Carlo had been paid to help get Sonny killed?  What if his beating of Connie that time was a deliberate plot to get Sonny out into the open? Then what?  And what if the Don, a great man, couldn't bring himself to do what he had to do, avenge his son's death by killing his daughter's husband?  What if that, finally, was too much for him, and he made Michael his successor, knowing that Michael would take that load off his shoulders, would take that guilt?
I wanted to tell you alone; your wife doesn't know what's going on.
Yes.
I know.  I went down to the Barrett house.  But she's gone.  They drove her and the kids to North Tahoe airport.
Two-thirty.  That gives me time to see my boy.
But your people... Neri... Rocco; you don't think...
Will we...be able to get who ordered it out of them?
A little care he can ride in with an electric motor.
The new government arrested him, held him for a couple of days with a lot of the other casino people, including Roth's brother, Sam.  The American Embassy arranged flights for citizens; I'm not sure, but I think he's somewhere in New York.
She took the Senate Investigation worse.
Roth engineered it, Michael.  He made Pentangeli think you hit him. Deliberately letting him get off alive.  Then the New York detectives turned Frankie over to the FBI.  My informants say he was half dead and scared stiff -- talking out loud that you had turned on him and tried to kill him.  Anyway, they had him on possession, dealing in heroin, murder one and a lot more. There's no way we can get to him and you've opened yourself to five points of perjury.
I turned Houstan down; I didn't see why I should tell you about an offer I turned down.  Are you sure, Mikey?  Are you sure of what we're doing; what we'll gain; what does the family gain? Forget that, Mike; I already know the answer.
Why do you hurt me, Michael?  I've always been loyal to you.
Your plans are a little different this time.  You skip Miami, and go straight to Geneva.  It's to be deposited to this number.  And it's got to be there by Monday morning, no slip-up.
He's ten times tougher than me, my brother.  He's old-fashioned.
Yeah, I still read a lot.  They bring me stuff.
Yeah, but only the rich guys.  The little guys got knocked off.  If they got arrested and executed, all their estate went to the Emperor. If they just went home and killed themselves, up front, nothing happened.
Thanks, Tom.  Thanks.
Do you gamble?
Simple.  Be friendly like us.  Not hostile.
He is, I believe, a brother.
Mr. Hagen's, ma'am.
I think it's too late for changes, Michael.  I promised myself I wouldn't talk about it and I've gone and spoiled it.
I didn't even know he had a brother. And where is he now?
And that's all he had to do.  Just show his face.
Get out of my hotel.
You talk about the baby.  She can have another baby.
Not for a few years.
The incident of the other night is a nuisance that I can take care of. I came to you because I want nothing to affect our agreement; I wanted to clear everything I'm going to do with you, just in case.
Technically, they are still under the Clemenza wing of the Corleone Family, now run by Frankie Pentangeli.  After Clemenza died, the Rosatos wanted territory of their own.  Pentangeli refused, and came to me, asking for permission to eliminate them.  I, of course, knew of their relationship with you, and in gratitude for your help with the Tropicana matter, turned him down.  Pentangeli was furious, and paid one hundred and fifty thousand dollars to have me killed. I was lucky and he was stupid. I'll visit him soon.  The important thing is that nothing jeopardize our plans, yours and mine.  This thing of ours, that we will build.
Pentangeli is a dead man; do you object?
I wouldn't consider anyone else.
I've read it; I'm pleased that the government is doing so well.  As a heavy investor, I'm pleased.  How did the doctor find you?
Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed?
I know that; but who gave the go ahead.
No, I'm fine.
I deny his every charge.
That is a complete falsehood.
They feel cheated.
Frankie, you're a good old man, and you've been loyal to my Father for years...so I hope you can explain what you mean.
Frankie, you know my father respected Roth, did business with him.
Then why do you want me to lay down to them?
Sitting right behind you.
You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do?
We want Brooklyn one hundred percent.  No more taxes to you.  We want to be only loosely connected with your family -- sort of a under-family all of our own.  Then we can act on all internal matters without talking.  Also we want you to inform Michael Corleone that we can deal directly with him.
Yes.
What was that?
Not so famous any of us have ever heard of him.
Do you realize you're more interested in this old goober than you ever were in me?
You mean us?
I'm not a kid.
Sure you're free, for now at least. But how long before you're just alone?  Pathetic and alone.
The Master is waiting for you.
Tea is fine.
He is dead now, twenty years.
No.  I have children, grandchildren too.  I visit when I can.  But now that Mr. Jimmy cannot be left very long, I do not get away much.  Poor Mr. Jimmy.  There is much good in him, but he will suffer the fires of hell.  Very sad.
This is what the priests tell me. His sins of the flesh will keep him from heaven.
A homo?
Well...no, not really --
I blame my daughter for keeping me out so late.  I only hope you did not get him excited.  It could give him a new stroke.
Boone.  Clayton Boone.
Just that I was in the Marines.
Yeah.  I better get on with my work.
Just got away from me.  Sorry to disturb you.
What?  Oh yes.
What did she mean by going flooey?
Huh?
Just a year.  I dropped out to join the Marines.
It's new.
All right already.  I'll take it off.  Kind of warm in here anyway.
Did anyone laugh?
Pity.  People are so earnest nowadays.
Sorry.  I don't feel like sitting still today.
I'm not, you know.
You don't think of me that way, do you?
What you do is no business of mine. Live and let live, I say.
No.  I --
There's no people like you in my crowd.
Something happened to him?
I'm game.  Sure.
If that's okay?
Actually, no.  I feel a little out of place.
Run for what?
Is that why you joined the Marines? For your father's sake?
I don't remember that one.
What won't do?
Please, Clayton.  Just for a minute.  Long enough for me to see the effect.
Relax, Clayton.  I can't hear you. I can't hear a word.
You'll feel better tomorrow.
Hasta la vista, Boone.  And give the jail bait a squeeze for me.
I think I'll hang around.
I just want to watch it, okay?
She took the night off.  Heavy date.  Some guy she's had her eye on for a while.
It's the ridiculous pills they prescribe.  If I take them, I spend the next day stupid as a stone. If I don't, my mind seems to go off in a hundred directions at once --
I wanted to be alert for your visit today.  Especially since I saw so little of you in the hospital.
Just what I was about to ask you. I thought you were in New York.
More your line.
Oh, nothing out of the ordinary. Growing old.
Perfectly all right.  But if you'd like to sit --
She is beautiful.
Of course.  This afternoon.
I have my family.  Also our Lord Jesus Christ.
I'll be out this afternoon, remember?  Your family can visit as long as they like.
Nice.  And your lighting and camera angles.  You're got to go back to German silent movies to find anything like it.
Everything.  Start at the beginning.
Your father was a schoolmaster?
Oh no, I want to hear everything. You made twenty pictures in all --
No.  I never said you were.  Or will be soon.
It is, isn't it?  My life as a game of strip poker.  Shall we play?
You must understand how Hollywood was twenty years ago.  Nobody cared a tinker's cuss who slept with whom, so long as you kept it out of the papers.  Outside of Hollywood, who knows who George Cukor is, much less what he does with those boys from the malt shops along Santa Monica?
He's one of the great images of the twentieth century.  As important as the Mona Lisa.
Head.  Not heart.
I'm sorry I spoiled it for you. You should probably go home.
I interviewed him after I met you. I'm his social secretary now. Well, assistant to his secretary.
Is there someplace we can talk?
Six years ...
What kind of job... ?
The point is: Kip's been living the life. Only he's a wild child. Crazy. Makes our old behavior seem like altar boy time. But he fungold this one so bad, folks around L.B. are already speakin' about him in the past tense.
And they still have the lowest rate of cancer of anywhere in the world. You know why? All they eat is seafood.
I do ...  Christ, what happened to us ?
Me, too. Every time I walk...
My version of "take this job and shove it..."
Yes ... Kip ...
Were it only that easy. I have obligations. The order needs to be filled...
I knew you'd say that.
I knew you'd say that, too --
One more night --
How is he?
You don't have anything on me. A misdee auto-theft. I got no record. I'll be out in three days, and back at it. Or you let them go, and I give you my word. I'm gone. And without the ringleader ... Your tee-times have just grown exponentially...
A little family emergency --
Kip.
I don't know. But you shouldn't be here. Take care of your business. I'll give you 24 hours. And then I don't want to see your face. Ever again. Make a fool of me once, that's my bad. Make a fool of me twice. That's really my bad, and I'll kick your ass from here to India ...
I don't think so, Detective ...
Yet your still here ... I gave you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ...
You know my back.
Needs brightening ...
The other day....
No particular reason. Catch a Laker game. I heard we got Shaquille ...
Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ...
Not at all ...
Good.
That's an after-market alarm. Can't just cut her wires ...
C'mon, man ...
Gray.
That's right. Only 10 exotics ...
one minute -- !
He didn't mess up. There it is ...
Remember who my brother is?
You, too, Ma...
Atley Jackson came to see me ...
I couldn't. I didn't want you to worry. I thought held sort himself out. I hardly see him. He comes and goes. He's in trouble, isn't he?
Of course ...
You guys are through...
I dunno ...
What am I supposed to do?
Hello, Memphis --
Oh. You maybe have more than one enemy who owns a car-crusher -- ?
What do you got ... ?
I can handle it --
I can handle it --
Otto called -
The family that steals together, deals together...
Maybe not. But Dad was from another era...
The era when crime didn't pay --
Hell, yeah... It's a beautiful business ...  I mean, no, man, it's hard, it's scary, it sucks ...
What?
I saw her get smashed-up on the TV. Knew there was no way he was gonna accept her ...
Hell, yeah. She's not my unicorn.
Shocking, huh? We're clear now. It's done. I've never actually paid for a car. I want to see what it feels like
No problem -
Things are all leafy and suburban ...
Yeah. He's knows of one all right.
Call 'em here -- ?
Hell, yeah. I'm not getting rich in here ...
On account of me.
What's wrong with her -- ?
No. Open her ...
Deodorant.
No. I had a girl. She was great. The problem is: great girls come along once every ten years. So I gotta wait another three years before I can even bother to look...
Woo-woo-wooooo!
I bet you say that to all the girls...
Kip's not clear yet. We got one more to go --
Nothing. Just that if I was less secure, I might think you were more into Eleanor than you are me...
His criminal career has officially come to a close ...
You sure I can't go with ya?
No ... No... No ... Tell me what's gonna happen? Kip? Tell me. What's gonna happen?
No. Come on. It was the younger one that was the bad one.
Billy, how are you?
Listen to him.  "Watch the suit," he says.  A little pisser I've known all my life.  Hey, Tommy, don't go get too big.
What thing? The Brooklyn thing?
Wha?  Me?
Paulie. Why would I? I swear.
Thirty-two hundred bucks. That's what he gave me. Thirty-two hundred bucks for a lifetime. It wouldn't have paid for the coffin.
He watches it for me. It's better than waiting at a garage.
Oh that. Don't worry about that. Nobody's gonna steal it.
I'm just having my last few drinks.
What are you talking about?
Let her carry this shit inside.
It'll be okay.
I can't do it anymore.
With what?
What did he say, exactly?
Paul will calm down. You'll see.
You know. The stuff I left.
Yeah. What about the kids' school?
What lions? I'm not going near any lions.
I gotta talk to you.
Come on, don't fuck around, will ya?
Jimmy, come on. Fuck 'em. Don't give them the satisfaction.
Yeah.
What are you gonna do? Fight with him?  He wants his money.
Will you stop.
I remember feeling bad about the guy. But I remember feeling that maybe Tuddy was right.  I knew Paulie didn't want anybody dying in the building.
I don't care. I need my hat.  I won't go without it.
Will you get the fuck out of here.
Ma!  Stop! What do you want me to do?
No, he was so hammered that he drove the police cruiser home. Fuckin' lights and everything!
All right, then.
Jesus Christ. Not even close.
No, and we got four of 'em.
I don't know yet.
Don't get too slap-happy, you're takin' me home first. WILL I don't know, Chuck. It's kinda outta the way.
Yeah, I figured now that you got your big job over in Cambridge, you needed some way to get over there and I knew I wasn't gonna drive you every day...
So, you ladies ah, go to school here?
Yah, it's not a bad school...
You caught that, huh?
So why don't you give me my sandwhich?
Shut up.
You're walkin' bitch, Will's takin' the car.
You thought we forgot, didn't you? I know I'm gettin' my licks in.
Fuck you, I did the body work. Whose fuckin' router you think sanded out all that bondo?
--These circumstances are mitigated. Right now. They're mitigated.
I have about seventy-three...
That's exactly right, Will. So the question as I see it isn't "why should you work for N.S.A." it's "why shouldn't you?"
It's like a small figure, hoverin' over me. Gettin' closer.
With a Ramses graph on the binary tree--
The limit is not found!  The limit is not found.
No students work for me.
Well, he didn't show up for work today...
What're those?
It's an integer proof.
I think so.
--Half-red, half-black--
Oh, come on! You're not pinnin' this one on me. He left, I wanted to talk to him for another twenty minutes. I was havin' fun.
The least you can do is show me a little appreciation.
It's a Carlton Fisk baseball card.
Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don't be afraid to give me a call.
Yes.
Find out what?
No. LAMBEAU Okay thank you, Timmy.
Well, it seems we're in the presence of greatness. Professor Gerald Lambeau is a Field's Medal winner. Combunatorial Mathematics. 1986.
It's on the college.
To show me he doesn't have to talk to me if he doesn't want to.
Sean, I really don't think you understand--
I do.
Now wait a minute, Gerry--
--Gerry--
--I'm not angry at you--
He's not you!
I got this mailer the other day. Class of Sixty-five is having this event in six months.
I don't got a crush on her.
Yeah, Morgan. I got fired.
Hold up.
Had one, now I'm fucked again.
Will, your not getting off that easy.
What places?
Do you find it hard to hide the fact that you're gay?
I'm sure you do. You probably got a real nice house, nice car -- your book's a best seller.
If you wanna hit "Ramrod," take your shot. Take some pride in it. You go to church? So fuckin' what, God loves you. I mean, Christ. A guy as well known as you? By the time you put your disguise on and skulk out of the house Sunday nights you probably look like "Inspector Cluseau."
How about Noam Chomsky's "Manufacturing Consent?"
You're right. It really gets in the way of my jazzercizing.
Nautilus?
285.
No.
Maybe you married the wrong woman.
You're just a boy. You don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about.
You've never been out of Boston.
So if I asked you about art you could give me the skinny on every art book ever written...Michelangelo? You know a lot about him I bet. Life's work, criticisms, political aspirations. But you couldn't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel. You've never stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling. And if I asked you about women I'm sure you could give me a syllabus of your personal favorites, and maybe you've been laid a few times too. But you couldn't tell me how it feels to wake up next to a woman and be truly happy. If I asked you about war you could refer me to a bevy of fictional and non-fictional material, but you've never been in one. You've never held your best friend's head in your lap and watched him draw his last breath, looking to you for help. And if I asked you about love I'd get a sonnet, but you've never looked at a woman and been truly vulnerable. Known that someone could kill you with a look. That someone could rescue you from grief. That God had put an angel on Earth just for you. And you wouldn't know how it felt to be her angel. To have the love be there for her forever. Through anything, through cancer. You wouldn't know about sleeping sitting up in a hospital room for two months holding her hand and not leaving because the doctors could see in your eyes that the term "visiting hours" didn't apply to you. And you wouldn't know about real loss, because that only occurs when you lose something you love more than yourself, and you've never dared to love anything that much. I look at you and I don't see an intelligent confident man, I don't see a peer, and I don't see my equal. I see a boy. Nobody could possibly understand you, right Will? Yet you presume to know so much about me because of a painting you saw. You must know everything about me. You're an orphan, right?
You've never been on a plane.
Fine.
I know what I'm doing. She's different from the other girls I met. We have a really good time. She's smart, beautiful, fun...
No, I don't.
I didn't write anything else 'cause nobody, including most of my colleagues bothered to read the first one.
Yeah.
October 21, 1975. Game six of the World Series. Biggest game in Red Sox history, Me and my friends slept out on the sidewalk all night to get tickets. We were sitting in a bar waiting for the game to start and in walks this girl. What a game that was. Tie game in the bottom of the tenth inning, in steps Carlton Fisk, hit a long fly ball down the left field line. Thirty-five thousand fans on their feet, screamin' at the ball to stay fair. Fisk is runnin' up the baseline, wavin' at the ball like a madman. It hits the foul pole, home run. Thirty-five thousand people went crazy. And I wasn't one of them.
Yeah.
Not without a heater and some serious smelling salts, no...
Oh, what? You're going to take the professor's side on this?
Why is it a cop-out? I don't see anythin' wrong with layin' brick, that's somebody's home I'm buildin'. Or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's gonna get to work the next day 'cause of me. There's honor in that.
If you won't answer my questions, you're wasting my time.
It's not your fault.
Thanks you.  So, that's it? We're done?
It's Will, the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar?
No.
I'm supposed to understand this.
No.
Then on behalf of my weiner, I'd like to ask for an advance.
I guess so.
How do you know that?
I can't go out to California.
I'm not sayin' I'm not in love with you.
--Don't tell me about my world. You're the one that's afraid. You just want to have your little fling with the guy from the other side of town and marry--
At least you have a mother.
No, you don't want to hear that.
I never cared about that.
Sure! I was just aimin' to meet up with a couple girls I know.
Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin' scared?
Don't hold me so tight.
Naw. They paroled me.
Gallon or two?
Banana cream, pineapple cream, chocolate cream--and apple.
Joad.
Four.
Two.
Why, I guess so.
Okay, mister. Whatcha payin'?
Riot? I don't see no riot. Who're you?
Joad. Tom Joad.
An' you say no cops?
Why ain't they more like it?
Pa always said you was never cut out to be a preacher.
I never let one go by me when I could catch her.
Have a little snort?
Didn't you hear? It was in the papers.
I'll be glad to see you pa. Last time I seen him was at a baptizin', an' he had one a the bigges' doses of the Holy Sperit I ever seen. He go to jumpin' over bushes, howlin' like a dog-wolf in moon-time. Fin'ly he picks hisself out a bush big as a piana an' he let out a squawk an' took a run at that bush. Well, sir, he cleared her but he bust his leg snap in two. They was a travellin' dentist there and he set her, an' I give her a prayin' over, but they wasn't no more Holy Sperit in your pa after that.
I never heard nothin' about it.
I ain't no preacher anymore.
I dunno. Payin' five now.
We was outa food. Tonight we had meat. Not much, but we had it. Think Pa's gonna give up his meat on account a other fellas? An' Rosasharn needs milk. Think Ma's gonna starve that baby jus' cause a bunch a fellas is yellin' outside a gate?
I hear it. I think they's some guys comin' this way, lots of 'em. We better get outa here.
Lissen, I heard that before--
Little trouble up ahead, but you'll get through. Just follow the line.
Then what are you doin' this kind a thing for--against your own people?
Can't you see that sticker?
Why don't you get to it, buddy?
Me neither. I'm just tryin' to get along without shovin' anybody around, that's all.  See that road up ahead?
What you mean?
It don't take no nerve to do somep'n when there ain't nothin' else you can do. 
Fi' cents! They pain' you fi' cents?
Hush!
You want to get ast to eat, hunh?
Didn' you have no breakfast?
Didn' none of these have no breakfast?
All but me! I'm a-stayin'.
And I ain't gonna listen either. I tol' you what I'm gonna do.  And I don't give a hoot in a hollow if they's oranges and grapes crowdin' a fella outa bed even, I ain't a- goin' to California!  This here's my country. I b'long *here*.  It ain't no good--  --but it's mine.
I didn't bust out. They lemme out. Howya, Noah. Howya, Uncle John.
Ain't nothin' the matter. I just ain't a-goin', that's all.
No plants.
Well, can't nobody get through nine *months* without sorrow.
This got a floor. Wouldn't leak when it rains.
No'm.
Go get Tom an' Al.  I dunno what to do. I got to feed the fambly. What'm I gonna do with these here?
Now don't get sassy, Ma.
She'll be awright.
Sometimes they do.
Ya say we're acrost?
No.
I was afraid they'd stop us an' wouldn't let us cross. But I tol' Granma. I tol' her when she was dyin'. I tol' her the fambly had ta get acrost. I tol' her we couldn't take no chances on bein' stopped.
They know what--this fella looks like?
Girl with a baby *always* gets prettier.
Awright, Tommy. What you figger you gonna do?
How'm I gonna know 'bout you? They might kill you an' I wouldn't know. They might hurt you. How'm I gonna know?
Good-by, Tom. Later--when it's blowed over--you'll come back? You'll try to fin' us?
Well, give me two then, ma'am.
Won't they come out here?
How's Granma since we got her in the tent?
I ain't got nothin' in *my* han'.
Think I'll walk out an' try to fin' out what all that fuss outside the gate was. Anybody wanta come with me?
We gonna stay, ain't we?
Awright, go on! Ain't nobody stoppin' ya!
I ain't gonna fret you. Go on!
If this don't beat all!  Well, I see you been busy already!
Man bones?
Lissen. You done busted it. You hear?  But lissen here. I won't tell nobody, y'understan'?
I won't--  --if you won't tell what *I* done!
Now don't you go monk'ing--
Shore looks like my lucky day, anyway. Gettin' some work at las'.
Ain't gonna be no trouble.
Awright. An' if she gets outa han', I'll be in the right han' corner, this side the dance floor.
I sell biscuits to the Southland.
What?
Sure. Listen. Why don't you join us up in the grandstands?
Really?
You could've been a contender, huh?
Then express yourself, Bob.
Insane.
Okay.
I don't know exactly. I could venture a guess but it would sound like a rationalization... I thought you know... maybe seeing you, some friends, my house... of course now a 7-11--
You see someone?
No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?
Yep.
Let me get this straight, are you asking me out?
Unbelievable.
As long as I get the laugh.
Okay... Hold on...
You're a government spook?
I have no illusions about the future. What is, is. We make choices. And we become the sum total of our choices. I can live with that.
It's in Michigan. Honestly, what do I have in common with those people? Or with anyone?
Come on.
Mmm.
Uneasy. Dispassionate. Bored. It's just getting hard to go to work in a good mood. I'm starting to think I've been in the business too long. Last week I did a guy younger than me.
Not me. So don't paw at me with your dirty little guild.
I didn't get into this business to have "associates." And I don't want to join your Goddamned union. "Loner-- " "Loner gunman." Get it? "On my own." That's the whole point. Why don't you become a cop, or something. You can drink coffee in the morning... with friends!
Fine. But we're not going to let you do your job. Because we're gonna do it. And then, after we do your job, we're gonna do another little job...
Excellent. Here they come.
Those all seem kind of related...
This?
All of it?
That's going to cost.
And they want me to make up for it.
There's nothing to be done about it.
Paperwork on the Detroit thing. It's a full dossier. Very comprehensive.
It's fine.
Yeah...
I have always thought about her and missed her.
Same thing that happened to you-- I stopped poutin' there on the sidelines. Got in. Got on the team. I joined the working week, you slick fucking asshole, so why don't you valet park your high horse and take it easy on your old buddy, Paul.
He gave me a great deal.
Oh, you know me, Martin. I'm the same old sell-out baby-boomer, exploiting the oppressed I got shot for at Kent State. But why don't we have a drink and forget the whole thing?
Look, even if it was nearer, that's just not what I do. I give clinics. And I'm not even doing them for a while. I'm heading back to Montana right now. I got a ranch to take care of...
Excuse me, with all due respect, but this is her decision, not yours. And I don't want to waste anybody's time -- mostly mine.
You ever just stand still for a minute?
What's that to miss?
Lucky for you. The grizzlies around here only go for joggers.
Sorry about that. I thought everything got cleared out. R.B. is my wife... ex-wife... Rachel. We used to live in that house together.
Just polite. Well, maybe you'd like to try riding again, some time before you go home.
He'd be grateful, he'd take real good care with you.
Yeah. I haven't seen him in a while. He used to come to the ranch over summers, but then he started having friends and was going off to college, so... Good boy. Hal. Lives in New York near his mom.
Huh?
Tom.
Ssshhh...  Stand still, Annie. Takes what we've got, just for now. Can you do that?
Annie!
Grace, I put it on the table near your --
I think we should. It's not fair to let him suffer. He's not much use anymore. He'd hate living like that.
Fine.
You just want to get away from Daddy and you're using me to do it!
Well, one was for salad...
You're right. Good.
... You worried everything all right now and we'll have to go home?
Yeah, you know everything!!
My period.
Uh, nothing. I'm going to pick it up in the other room -- would you hang this up for me?
Go ahead...
Exactly...
Sure... What's Grace up to?
Sing it to me, Frankie!
He did, but... I think I can change his mind.
I'm not asking you to. I'll do it.
Robert, we're losing her. We're losing her.  I don't care what the doctors say. The truth is, they don't know anymore than we do -- less, when it comes to Grace... This may not sound sensible or... logical, but nobody's suggesting anything better. I can't explain it, Robert. I just have this feeling... this annoying... bloody feeling that if... if, somehow, Pilgrim can be made all right... then so can Grace. I just know it!
I know. We miss you too.
Oh, Robert, I'm sorry. We were so tired from the branding. Grace barely made it to her bed and I didn't have the energy to take my clothes off.
Fine. Actually, today was a good day. You should have seen her.
You're allergic to hay.
Let's not talk about that now.
Connecticut. I told the office I'd work out of there next week. When are you planning to start back?
May I have a suggestion?
I don't understa-
What do you mean?
I don't know. Let's just go and... we'll see...
We have a business manager. The best around.
No. He had the choice.
Either fight the way things are or accept it.
It's fine. Comfortable. I still can't get used to how dark it gets around here, though. When we leave the ranch, I always hold my breath until I can see the motel.
She calls him Tommy...
Delayed shock. Or maybe not. I know I could talk my way back if I wanted or... go to another magazine, someplace... Just not sure if I want to.
They don't come better. But I don't deny there are times I wonder about things I won't have. Maybe one day I'll get to see Egypt. Maybe not. But I know if you try too many different lives, you can wind up with no life at all...
He's a good man, Tom is. He's got a gift, come from heaven above, I swear. But he's still a man. And a woman can lead a man into the middle of a mountain lake -- and still make him think he's on dry land.
Oh, how sweet.
Her leg was shattered so they had to, uh... remove it. She had some bleeding but it's under control.
Problem is, there aren't many volunteers. He's already had enough to sink a battleship. You have a pin, just in case?
Oh hell, I don't know... According to Tom, she's a pretty determined woman. Must've thought it was worth it.
It's got doors, Diane. Private as can be. Tom?
No thanks.
That's what some folks say.
Tell her they suit the weather better. Their udders are black, 'stead of pink.
You know her?
And next time, Miss Annie, you can run down the calves...
I don't thinks you'd want me tripping all over you in front of everybody.
Not to me. Either you want to or you don't.
I don't have all day.
I don't know if I can.
You want to go to a movie tonight?
We already did the river. Let's go down and across the old bridge. We can circle back.
I'm okay... I'm okay.
NO!
I want to see Pilgrim.
YA JUST HAD A TURN. IT WAS NOT.
Oh yeah...
Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for.
I'm sorry, sir. We caught him by surprise, so we don't think he had time to erase his computer files.
Record the tones that the coins make. And hang up and get your money back!
What is it with this guy?
...as they snoop onto us.
Stupid, man. It's universally stupid.
Ain't no way, man, security's too tight. The big iron?
Yeah. Probably had something to do with that bank in Idaho.
Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With me, we can do it in seven.
Dead?
Right. If I win, you wear a dress on our date.
Yeah, mom?
Right, mom. And I'm still a virgin!
I told you, I don't play well with others.
And judging by this segment alone, it's already eaten about...
Pool on the roof must have a leak.
Yeah?
Are you challenging me?
You're not gonna win.
The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.
Right, and at this rate it ends its run in...
It's my subway defense system.
Yo, chill man, I'm talking to Venezuela.
Sorry, I can't help you, okay?
I think we've got something.
Must have been hell, huh? Zero Cool?  A virus has been planted in the Ellingson Mineral computer system. You were our prime suspect, till we trashed your stuff and found no trace of it.
What's going on? Let go of me! Stewardess! I'll never fly this airline again!
What's happening?
As in what, you hapless techno-weenie?
You're hopeless, man, utterly hopeless.
I copied it from Ellingson, okay? They're asking me about it, alright? Will you take a look for me?
Yeah. Whose gonna notify his next of kin?
Excuse me?
Well luckily, you have a gifted and talented security officer. I traced the hacker's call. The secret service picked him up this morning. I'll just search his files for the original virus code, and then I can eliminate it.
I created Mister da Vinci so we could call in the Secret Service. So they'd arrest the hacker, sieze his equipment, things that we can't do on our own.
I disguised myself as an Alabama State Trooper and penetrated the FBI NCIC.
Nonono, thank YOU!
Yeah.  Should be on the road.
Don't get angry.
I don't know Brady.
So you hop on to the next best thing? I thought you were different from other guys.
Oh really? Well, I'll just let you get back to little Ms. Hot panties.
Michael Myers.
10 years ago? Halloween? He's Jamie's uncle.
I don't know!
Get back!
Sometime in the night. They probably lost the road in the storm. Come down the embankment. It happens.
Look, even if by some miracle Michael is conscience, his muscles would be totally useless.  Give the troopers a chance to search.
You guys always look great.
How do you know their not?
I told them to be here by nine. Its not 9:30 yet.
I'm not calling the fire department.
About what?
For Christ sakes. Spare me the speech. I've listened to it for a decade.  The fact is that Michael Myers was a federal patient, and a federal prisoner therefore he is subject to federal law.
How many people in the bus?
How many bodies did you find?
Ready to go.  Who signs for him?
Sure ain't. Martians could land on Ben's doorstep, all he'd do is spit once and get himself a shot gun.
No way. No how.
Al here lost his boy 10 years back.
Your mother used to baby-sit me when I was your age.  I bet you didn't know that.
You ready for some Ice Cream?
But I thought you didn't want to go trick-or-treating.
In a second.
Oh Rachel!
I can't.
I've got you come on, go down.
Then we'll be safe?
You knew. You just didn't care.
Hi Jamie.
Well I don't want to come on too strong. A guy hates a girl to come on strong. Fragile egos and all of that.
Its not over yet.
The state police won't know how to stop him.
Maybe nobody knows how to stop him, but I've got to try.
No problem, Sheriff.
This is 132, over.
I'll be there in 5 minutes.
Yeah in the trunk of my squad.
Michael Myers has escaped from Ridgemont. He's here in Haddonfield.
All right, all right. Its true, what the hell can we do to avoid a repeat of what happened 10 years ago?
He's been here.
Dear God.
They didn't know what they were fighting.
It isn't a man.
Gods Country, Promise Land. Where are you heading Mr..ah
Apocalypse, end of the world, Armageddon. Its always got a face and a name.
Hi, Dad. What happened?
You blame everything on kids.
We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed up.
Fun-ny. See you.
Terrific. I've got three choices. Watch the kid sleep, listen to Lynda screw, or talk to you.
Okay. Bye.
I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?
I doubt that. Listen, my mother is letting me use her car. I'll pick you up. 6:30.
What's this big, big news?
Annie!
This has not been my night. My clothes are in the wash, I spilled butter down the front of me, I got stuck in a window...
I can't.
Lindsey, open the door! I'm locked in the laundry room!
Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other...
...Then you rip my clothes off. Then we rip LYNDSEY'S clothes off. I think I've got it.
Not since 1963, since it happened. Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted.
Could have...
You're not coming up with much to prove me wrong.
Three blocks down. Get in the car and go up that other street and then back down here. I'm going up the block.
I don't think so...
Same time, same place.
Sure.
Laurie, what's the Boogey Man?
I'm so embarrassed. I couldn't face him...
After the Jack-O-Lantern.
There is no such thing.
I promise.
I saw him...
I'm scared...
Was it the bogyman?
Hi, Lindsey, this is Paul. Is Annie there?
Will you get her for me?
Are there any special instructions?
What does that mean?
The only thin that ever bothers me is their jibberish. When they start raving on and on...
He asked me if I could help him find his purple lawnmower.
I can't believe it!
Well, let's hope so.
Oh.
Oh--
You want to see some?
Mmm.
Oh, in this we're a big hit. Yesterday I auditioned for Come Back Little Sheba.  That, I wasn't such a big hit.
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
I mean, it's jammed.  If we went... um...
Oh, uh, listen, David called me up.
Ah! HOLLY  Now.
And it ruins everything else.
Oh, okay.
This time I really think I have something.
You mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness.
Yes, is it, is it, uh, healthier to have problems in both ears?
Well, if it's nothing, then why do I have to go into the hospital at all?  I mean, uh, I hear perfectly fine, so I'm, so I'm a little weak on the, on the high decibels.  So I, you know, I won't go to the opera.
Hi.
'Cause I got a lot of wall space there. 
Yes, I do.
Yes, it's-it's wonderful.
You seem tense.  Is everything all right?  You feel okay?
Everything's okay? 
Thanks for showing me the bookstore. Perhaps you could, uh, take me to an AA meeting sometime.  Uh...uh, I'd love to see what goes on.
Bye.
Yeah.
I know this.  Bach.  F Minor Concerto.  It's one of my favorites.
Yes, he's just adorable.
What are you doing?!
Why?
I can't say anything!
I don't want anyone else ever to have you.
Oh, my God.
Ah, it's over!  Elliot, I mean it. It's over!
Aren't they great?
I know!  I know!
Holly and April, thanks for helping.
Yeah, I know.  I-I can't believe I forgot.
Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.
Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle.
Are you angry with me?
How can we be happy?
But Catholicism?  Why not your own people?
Mom, come out!
Mm-hm.
Based on what?  You never even see him.
I don't know.  I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while.
No.
Stop accusing me!
Yeah.
Oh...
You know... 
I can't keep my mind on the show.
Listen, kid, I think you snapped your cap.
I think they're fantastic.
Okay.
Why?
Oh, Hannah, she's-she's just embarrassed in front of you, that's all.
No.
Really?
Oh...
I know...I know.
Two minutes on your sons' birthday. You know, it's not going to kill you.
Oh, you know what?  I'm trying to convince him to produce a play.
Yeah.
...you know?  I, uh...
Wow!
I don't know.  Excessive masturbation?
With a, with a stranger?  With a--
W-w-we-we've decided after a lot of discussion that we-we'd try with artificial insemination.
No!  I like to joke around and have fun, and he gets angry because I get the attention.  He's gotten sourer as he's gotten older, and I've tried to stay young...at heart.
The sacrifices I've made because of that man.  He's ruined me with his ego, his philandering, his--  his-his-his-his mediocrity!
Yeah.
I should get a garter belt.
Oh, your kids are so adorable.
It's, uh, you never know--
Here.  Be careful with those.
Oh!
Oh?
Really?
No!  No, I, eh, it's just that they sing.
What?  You don't, don't be so sensitive.  Can't I say anything?
So what's new?
Yeah, that's clerical.
I'm real upset about what you wrote.
You make it sound like, you know, I have no needs or something.  You think I'm too self-sufficient?
I don't see how you could know about these things unless Elliot's been talking to you.
No!
Eh, Mickey, it's getting late.
Yeah.  Me, too.
...I had a great time tonight, really.  It was like the Nuremberg Trials.
I remember you.
Yeah.
I'm fine.
Yeah?
Yeah, it was.
...in a really horrible way.
Well, I hope you've changed.
No, well...I've been trying to write.
Well, it was just fabulous!  I'm, I, you know...
I am.  You-you made my day.
Well...  I'll tell you.  One day about a month ago...
Hi.
Okay.
Hmm.
Yeah, okay, right.  Forget it.  What's to eat?
Tell me about your trip... what did you <u>bring</u> me...?
I hereby acknowledge that...
Oh yeah?  Wanna arm wrestle...?
...what <u>hindered</u> you...?
It's a growth business.
I'm struck by your phraseology.  I did not <u>last</u> with him.  I was privileged to enjoy his company during that time.
<u>That's</u> the spirit...
You want me to be?
Oh, yes.  He's found Peace.
And who is "they?"
M'I gonna see you tonight?
Are you <u>alright</u>...?
Atrocious Torture.  Hit of the Season, you want, I know a guy can get you a ticket.
Impossible.
Yes, but we know who it was, and I will tell you, Agent Starling, what you know to be true.  I offered the bounty.  It was illegal, and, worse, it was <u>wrong</u>. And I thank God every day that I did not compound my sinful life by the stain of a murder.  Do you  Agent Starling:  do you know <u>God</u>? 
...Let's see the pigs, please.
Somewhere in Italy.
Show me the Pigs.
OHFORGODSAKE, get ON with it.
Yes.  You know I will.  That's right.
You said the <u>bad</u> news...
I can make you rich.
....what...? 
Starling, I've ordered you to shut...
You seen John Brigham...?
Am I on that case, sir...? 
I'm going to work for your reinstatement...
And how did she get close enough to disarm you?
She was there, alone, sir, she was in a burning building, waiting for your folks to come through the wall.  And...
Well, then, you're a lucky girl, cause that baby's gone to be your family.  ...I've got an appointment....
I have had many excellent meals there.
I know that the officers who first investigated his disappearance searched for a <u>note</u>, a farewell note, a suicide note...
...your <u>scar</u>..?
How so?
You resemble a figure from the Della Robia Rondels, in your family's chapel at Santa Croce.
I <u>sense</u>...  The faintest <u>whiff</u> of a perfume, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u> is "Hamamelis" ... it is <u>witch-hazel</u>--such a clean scent.  No, not a European scent. I would say it is a scent of the New World.  I would say, you have been in America.  Have I struck home?
...you have <u>brought</u> this perfume... brought this perfume.  Back.  <u>Back</u> from America.  To your New Wife...  You have given it to her, and some of...  Some of 'her perfume' has found its way back onto you.  Lucky man.  Lucky man, indeed.
Indeed I am.  And the connection, between Dante, and, in fact, between your illustrious forebears... if you'd come with me, I could show you...
Well, if you will excuse me.  Madame. What a pleasure.
If such there breathe, I'm sure you could <u>unearth</u> him...  Your reputation does you honor. 
She my foster.

...and Shirly, let me sleep with her sometime.
They <u>will</u>, sir.  We <u>train</u> them, to the figurine, <u>eventually</u>, they consume a man, say, 80 kilos, say, in...
Oh, no, no.  It won't be <u>that</u> long.
And I'm telling you:  You wanna throw a Birthday Party:  Every kid gets a Chance to Play, that's <u>fine</u>, but...
Sir, I was, as instructed, waiting for the Arrival of the Strike Force. {PAUSE)
...we were speaking of my <u>father</u>...
...and my need for The Institution...
And how did he do that?
Yes, to cease to Hope is the Greatest Crime.  The Greatest crime.  Perhaps the <u>only</u> crime.  <u>I</u> never ceased to hope!
...after you' re dead.  AND WHEN I GIVE THE WORD, do you understand...when I give the <u>word</u>...
...what has she done to harm you...?
What else's he goin to do with his day, he can't work, and he won't steal...
Yeah, but who would marry friendless <u>me</u>...  Howabout you, Romeo...?
What do you want to do?  You want to jam up that sonofabitch Krendler.
Every suicide kills two.
You goin to shoot yourself? 
Why?
They aren't expensive, you got them through your connections.... speaking of which:
....because we don't have any mmm...
Oh, my <u>program</u>...
Yes, but the <u>important</u> thing, as I've said...
Or clear your windshield with it.
I know it well.
Dottore Fanelli...
"A liaison position with the Opera." 
No.  That's right.  That's all part of it.
...would you use a small word?
...you <u>are</u> an orphan.
I don't understand.
I want to do something <u>positive</u>...
...why?
And you have been <u>dreaming</u>... dreaming about this Hat, and...
No, sir, it's not my job to capt... why do you say how terrible?
Isn't it funny?  You can look on my face  which you would grant me, is the most hideous sight you will see in what I hope is a long life. You can look at me.  Which shows  a Strength which <u>must</u> come from strong  strong convictions.   But you <u>shy</u> when I say the name of God.
I can be a good pig. Babe. Charlotte's Web. Good pig. Watch.
And this Peepers was your...dog?  If it makes you feel better, I probably wasn't paying attention.
That's it, Adam, pretend it's one of those arcade things, the tighter you squeeze, the more of a man you are...Ooh, that's it.
That's good. I wouldn't have wanted to embarrass myself.
I'm not really a--Does it count if...
They wouldn't be a bit surprised..
Wha-at?  What is it?
What are you gonna do about it?
Why am I so--That's new--The way I figure it is if I can get through to just one camper...then I'm a pretty incompetent counselor.                                           ] Don't get caught. I'll deny                                 ] everything.                                                 ]

Yeah. And?

Be nice. Her father died in that TWA flight the government shot down...You know I'm going to be in the city next week.

Betty Finn. Gosh.....
Oh Ronnie, you have to look at what I dug up the other day.
Don't get cocky, girl.
That's bullshit. Just shoot.
Because you're an idiot.
Color me educated. I learned high school happiness is for members only, Pauline Fleming wouldn't know reality if it lived in her uterus, and reality's name's Heather James. Also, J.D.'s a major creep.
Something like that. Will you do it?
Ouch....the lunchtime poll. So what's the question?
Shut up, it is. I told Dennis if he gave me another topic that was political, I'd spew burrito chunks.
I'm sorry, it's just why can't we talk to different kinds of people?
Don't worry. David says he's very so he's very.
Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.
Strength. Westerburg doesn't need mushy togetherness, it needs a leader. Heather Chandler was that leader but...
Okay, I'm going, I'm going. Jesus...
People love you but I know you. Jennifer Forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton...
Give it up girl!
Sure.
Sure, I'm on my way to a party at Remington University.
A well-timed lightning bolt through her window and Monday morning, all the other heathers, shit, everybody would be cast fucking adrift.
But before that, I'd like to see Heather Chandler puke her guts out.
Chick-en.
Stop kidding around. I'm going to have to send my S.A.T. scores to San Quentin instead of Stanford.
It's one thing to want somebody out of your life. It's another thing to serve them a wake-up cup of Drano.
Yeah, but don't worry, it was worth it just to see the look on....
Of course.
Did not.
Sure. Can we make an ice run before the funeral?
I don't get it! You were wrong! I was right! Strength, damnit! Come back!
Wait a....You're not listening! I'm not on your side....
Hey Ram, doesn't this cafeteria have a No Fags Allowed Rule?
Let's kick his ass.
I guess.
Get a job.
Actually, Mr. Rieper . . . it's a novel, and we'll be sending it to New York. That's where all the big publishing houses are based.
playfully shoves his hand away.
frowns at Henry.
But she'll have no one to look after her!
From now on, you're sleeping in the house, where we can keep an eye on you.
Well, I guess I take after you then!
I care . . . your father cares . . . we want you to have a good education.
These stories are not going to get you School Certificate! You don't seriously think anyone's going to publish them?
Oh, no . . . Mummy's awfully good at it.
Thank you so much!
I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued.
Thank you. I bought it especially, Mrs. Rieper.
turns around and Juliet presents her with a brown paper bag.
This . . .
That . . .
They'll blame the bloody housekeeper. She nicks stuff all the times!
I need my sodding parents' consent.
I think she knows what's going to happen . . . she doesn't appear to bear us any grudge!
Let's go for a walk down here . . . come on, Mummy!
It's the morphine Trevor. You're on so much of it, you could be asleep and dreaming even with your eyes wide open.
Your wife...?
Well that's not necessarily a bad thing is it?
I'm stumped.
Well?
Did I ever talk about the accident?
No you don't understand. That's why I've been fighting to get you better. So you wouldn't be a patient anymore.
Trevor things like this happen to people who experience temporary memory loss. Everybody does things they regret. You just couldn't remember doing these things and now you are so it's a shock to the system. I'm telling you. You will never get better if you keep blaming yourself for your wife's death.
Look never mind. Just get some numbers going- any numbers at all will due. The hills have eyes remember?
Someone special.
I've been in here before.
Do I really want to know what you're talking about?
I'm... I'm doing a very special thing here. And you can't even ... respond?
Really? Why?
For me? Trevor! How romantic! Come here, you.
I did read that, yes.  What hospital were you going to? I mean the Lodovico Street Bridge isn't exactly on the way to Mercy General.
Thanks.
A little? Try unbelievably.
Well they'd have to prove it in a court of law for one thing-
Seeing you were her sole benefactor, and I'm the executive of the will, Kirsty's entire estate would have to be donated to the city.
What things do you think you've done?
I don't even know what's real and what isn't how can I trust anyone?
Uh... sure, Tawny... what?
For starters. It's also got fennel, asparagus, olives, some more of mother nature's aphrodisiacs... Back in college, me and my roommates used to call it hard- on stew.
I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...
I sell them at the recycling center. Gives me a little for gas and food.
What am I, a goddamn postman?  I'm way the fuck up here, I'm scared a heights, and you want me to deliver a letter?  Put a stamp on it for Chrissake!
I don't recall saying I didn't want a million bucks...
Jail!  Listen, Bubber...  This is crazy.  We could fall off of here.
What's the big deal?  You decided to pretend you were me.  A little moment of weakness, right?  So I sorta swiped her purse.  I got feet of clay too, bUddy.
Huh?  Whadda you mean?
Allen?  He... he's okay?
I got your bail continued.
Are you pretty involved in his upbringing?
It's November.
I think you should visit your son. And try and get your boss to write a note about your performance on the job.  You need to create the impression of a responsible, decent citizen with familial responsibilities who happened to slip up once.
Twenty-five grand is peanuts!  All you gotta do is get me outta here long enough to collect.
I took a loan on my car and my computer.
I was inspired by the hero, how he stuck his neck out for others, how he took a chance...
So you can call me "naive," Mister LaPlante.
Mister LaPlante...
Nine.  I think.  Maybe ten.  Yeah, ten.  Nice kid.
The thing about kids is, they're so... young!  They don't know nothin' yet.  When you're a kid, you think you're gonna grow up an' be a "wonderful person" instead of an asshole, like everybody else.
I'm not gonna throw you out, Bernie.
You mean like Bubber?  The hero?
Well... I mean... what am I supposed to say here, Bern?  Is this a riddle or what?
I wouldn't be depressed about it, Bern.  A guy don't have to be heroic to be a human being.
Why doncha let me in so we don't wake everybody in the neighborhood?
He's in bed!  You're not gonna wake him and make him crazy, do you understand?  He comes home from the zoo, he wants to know if Elliot's a "war hero" like you... he wants to know how many people you killed...
Back to the jungle, Bernie.  Good night.
How did you acquire this, Mister LaPlante?
Yes, everybody <u>is</u> in love with John Bubber.  The whole country, in fact. And they're not going to be happy if he jumps to his death because he was harassed by a lousy little money-grubbing low-life fence...
In all that smoke and fire, John had a moment of weakness.  He'd been down and out, destitute, living in his car.  It was just an impulse, stealing my purse.
Who am I?  You're asking me?  You're the big expert for Chrissake!  I'm what?  The "Scumbag," right?  The sleazebag something or other, the blackmailer, the...
Thanks.  Thanks, pal.
No, I don't have the right.  You're a <u>news</u> <u>story</u>!
Maybe, maybe not.  I have a feeling this guy is important somehow.
"For Excellence in the Pursuit of Truth."
Because he was a <u>real</u> hero, Chucky. He was acting out of a deep instinctive decency, not out of some ego thing.  He didn't expect the media to lionize him.  He didn't expect a million dollar reward. He saved fifty-four people because something inside him, some fundamental love for his fellow man, made him rush into that plane when "good sense" told him otherwise. He was willing to settle for some credit cards he sold to LaPlante....  For how much, LaPlante?  A couple of bucks?  Did you give him enough for a decent meal?
It's a wonderful piece.  Emotional. I love it.
What about a reward for coming forward?
Drake Hotel, Penthouse Suite.  Never stop worrying.  I figure we'll do a sidebar on what it's like to go from sleeping in your car and collecting cans to sleeping in the poshest suite in town.  Also Gale's onto something, digging into his background.
For ten more minutes they love him, Wally.  I'm sick of him and I'm always about ten minutes ahead of the public.
Who lost a shoe?  Wash your hands.
Dad!
You didn't?
We couldn't find his name on the buzzer or on the mailbox, but...
What about?
Nah, that's some guy fixing the living room floor.
Let's watch some TV.
A lot of my stuff hasn't been unpacked yet.  Here's the TV.
I'm looking for some perfume.
Well, it's for a woman.
Well, we talked about the whole disapproval thing.
That would be stupid.
It's a living.
I've asked him what's wrong.
He'll never appreciate it more.
"We don't want to be late for our first day of school."
I can't help it if my homework is torn to shreds three times a week by someone <u>much</u> bigger than me</u>.
I think we got it just in time before the ink dried.
He's staying with a friend.  Hurry up now, you'll be late for school.
That's okay, Mom.
Stop knowing me so well.
You wanted furniture too, didn't you?
It'll be even shorter if I get that new job.  Come on.
Honey, nobody buys a house overnight -- if someone else comes back at them, well, we might have to make a counter offer.  But we can't look too eager or we'll get screwed.
Paul Newman in "The Hustler."
What?
It's just a dumb game they play. You want to be at a bigger firm, get used to the politics.
<u>No</u>.  If I hear anything you'll be the first to know, all right?
He's made some friends, hasn't he?
I don't care, Philip.  You want to go chasing Barbara Zelman, go ahead.  Just watch out for those buck teeth.
There <u>are</u> people who do things because they <u>want</u> to get caught.
Fuck you, Philip.
Did you lock the garage door?
Yeah -- she did a good job.  This glass looks brand-new.
He wasn't there.
There's always an excuse, isn't there?
That's not a decision for you to make on your own.
Not very long.  There have been a couple of bids already.
What for, dickweed?
Put it out, man!
Do you have enough money?
I have a cold.
Get on the other side of that.
Am I supposed to believe that this guy got shot in the chest six times at point blank range and just got up and walked out?
Yes.
Yeah -- how'd you know that?
What is it?
We don't have any proof of that.
Cut him loose.  The D.A. says you ain't got shit on this guy.
No.  I don't scare easy.
Around.
Lieutenant, you're really frightening me.
No -- it isn't.  A cop died today and the other is barely holding on.  I want some answers, Nash.
Since we hardly know each other, I'm sure you'll understand if I hold one to it for awhile.
Aye.
There will be more to the prize than that.  Power will come with it -- and it must be used for good.
Perhaps -- but if I must face it, let it find me, for I shall search for it no more.
What?
Are you always this pleasant?  You know what you're problem is?
I'm sure they will.
Living.  Remember?
What worries you?
I've learned that a man can only go so along living alone.
No -- I will.
No -- after you.
She's a treasure she is.
I lied.
Why not?
You'll no see me again.
Aye.
I remember you.
I don't think we have anything to talk about, Miss Hillman.
You got me.
This is.  Go home.  Stay out of this.
It's mine.  It's been in my family for years.  It belonged to my great, great, great grandmother.
I'll be fine.
I told you I'm interested in mythology.  We can talk about it more.
--the crest of a lion and a dragon and a single word:  Courage.
You?
It will end tonight.
Why?
What?  How?
How could they get by him?
I don't think it is a duplication.
I do not know -- and even if I did...
It will not end tonight.
Aye -- that I would, lass.
I'll no forget you.
Yes.
There's nothing I can do.  I'll wait. One way or another soon it will all be over soon.
You also have a power, Conner.  It is why you have survived.
I haven't lived life -- I've hidden from it.  I've existed in the shadows.
I can take care of myself.
Don't tell anyone what you're doing, not Louise, not the other guys, not the Sheriffs.  You understand me, Larry?
Get to work.
The cell phone is registered to a jewelry store in Beverly Hills.  The phone company shows no unusual --
What do you want to do?
I have contacts in Los Angeles.  Lawyers and judges who can help you.
We got jobs, man; we're working.  Why even take the chance?
We're on foot.  We can't get away.
We gotta find a way outta here is what we gotta do!
Are you totally stupid?  What does it look like?
The Bristo Police Department.  Look out the window.  You see the car?
How about your two friends?  You don't have a man dying in there, do you?
Maybe that's what I'm doing.  Can I reach in my pocket, show you something?
Take'm back upstairs, but don't tie'm like before.  That little fuck untied himself anyway.
I got the gasoline --
I don't eat junk food.
What hospital?
My wife and my daughter and the money. I'll bring the disks to the mall by the freeway, you bring my family.  We'll trade.
First my girls.  I get my girls, you get the other disk.
If you shoot me, he'll kill your daughter.  Do you want to lose both of them?
We'll see you in a couple of hours.
Don't worry about it.  How are you doing?
That's okay.  I love you anyway.
I don't drink beer.
We're hungry.  You're going to cook.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Whatever.
Dennis and Mars are in the den.  I'll get your brother, then come back for you. We'll go down the stairs and out the front door, you understand?
Get in the car.  <u>Now</u>.
Another minute.  Please --
York Estates.  Four-five-five Castle Way. Anders and Jorgenson are on the way.
What's that, Chief?  Say again.
Junior Kim was DOA at the hospital.
Jesus Christ, Louise, we can't leave a crime scene like that.  Put a unit out there.
And now I'm taking it back.  We're getting Smith out of the house.
Don't question me, Captain!  This is <u>my</u> crime scene!
Goddamned small town bullshit.
Run a DMV on the plate for the owner's name.
Yes, sir.
Are all of you named Jones?
You used to be a cop.  All of you used to be cops.  I can tell by the way you move.
What?
You and I are gonna straighten this out with the Sheriffs, and then we'll wait for the man to call.  When he gives the word, we move.
Dennis hit him.  His head's all big and he won't wake up.  I'm really scared.
We're okay.
I need your help with something.  But if you think those guys could catch you, then I don't want you to do it, okay?
I think he was working on them today, so they're probably in his office.  Could you find them and see who they belong to?
I opened Marlon.  I think it's somebody's taxes.
How do I reach him?
Follow the Mustang.  We won't go far.
They're killing everyone. The Lady Minister! The UN soldiers. They're at the gate.
That's what I came to talk to you about.
Of course.
I'll be back.
No. I work at the Mille Collines.
Where is your family?
There is nothing to it.
I swear, Captain, one hundred thousand francs, enough for a house. I will get the money, you keep them outside.
What's happening?
Congratulations. You should spit in my face.
That explains it. I'm sorry to tell you this but we've heard rumors the Militia are getting ready to storm the hotel.
What did you overhear?
What did they say?
The front gate would be best, General.
I wish I were like you. Look at my staff, they won't work, they listen to no one.
Get in.
How so.
Politics is power, Paul. And money.
At least.
We’re not going outside the hotel grounds unless we have an armored car. That's the ground rules.
Oh my God!
Gregoire, what are you doing here?
I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish.
The guest list. It hasn't been updated since the murder of the president.
That will take time.
We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.
No blood. As I left a neighbor, an old woman, waved to me. I went to her house. She has the little girls. They are safe.
The third floor are low class rooms.
Yes, with Fedens and the children.
Homework?
We must do something.
I couldn't help.
Get in.
What are you going to do? You cannot drive them out onto the road. They can stay with me.
He needs to be in a safe place.  Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?
What about us?
Enough of this. We stay together. Let me rest, I will feel better then.
No, no.
It's alright. This is the only place I can find some peace.
In Ruhengeri?
Tell me what it was.
What sort of car?
I will follow on the next plane. Go.
Anais, it is so good to see you.
Thank you, sir, you saved our lives.
What's wrong?
It depends where you sit Zozo. In coach it is like the bus to Giterama.
How dead?
Open up the ballroom, we'll put them there. And Zozo tell the kitchen to make rice and beans - a lot of it.
Many beers.
Paul, do everything you can to buy time. I will call you back.
Please, papa, I have a secret path.
Can I help you?
If that's the fact, Price, okay, you've had your fun -- now open the goddamn --
Not too big on it myself -- but then again, not on marriage either.
-- there's plenty: for all we know, Steven's got her spying on us right now --
But they didn't see it happen, they still have doubts. What we need is another body, and Steven's bloody hands right next to it!
I'm moved beyond words.
-- uh, excuse me, just one quick question? How long before this damn thing unseals itself?
Donald W. Blackburn, M.D.
Is she alright?
I don't know!!
Yeah, me too.
I'll stay, if it'll ease your mind.
Nonsense! Just bad press. All the deaths that occurred inside -- my own father's included -- all perfectly normal fatal accidents.
A cleaning crew's supposed to arrive at 9:30 tomorrow morning -- I think the power of the house fades at dawn.
Nothing.
Hell NO!! The House will kill ya!
The...Fourth of July.
What's life, anyway? Waves...? Sound...? Light...? Electricity...? I don't know... Phone lines...?
It's not going to let us out!
Up here --
Yeah. But, hey, anybody who's not "comfortable" with the rules, you're free to walk, anytime. Seven digits poorer, goes without saying.
I don't think so...
-- that's the fact, bud --
-- listen to the man --
Maybe there are notes or drawings of this place, showing how those plates work.
He's gotta still be down here.
Run.
I don't do groups.
Oh. You think this is a request. Well, think again. I'm telling you: "Haunted Hill" is exactly where we're having my party this year. You'll find the guest list on your desk by the time you get back --
I'm impressed: I don't think Evelyn's ever said those words to anything with genitalia.
You shouldn't be -- you were nearly just killed, sweetheart.  And now that our birthday girl is finally here, let the games begin!
Shredded. Sorry. Decided to whip up one of my own: a group so hungry for money that they'd be willing to do anything. I thought you'd be more comfortable with your peers.
Which part of that fantasy turns you on most: me with other men -- or just the other men?
Steven??
No, no, it's just --
Like what?? This isn't supposed to be happening!!
I can't remember at the moment.
Sorry, Pritchett, here you go.
I think, Pritchett, we've got a situation here that even you can't explain away as "ghosts." This is ice- cold homicide by person -- or persons --
You're forgetting my lovely wife; she's part of the same winner-take-all as the rest of you.
Oh, sorry. Detail I guess I forgot to mention. You die, you lose. Your check gets divvied-up by those still amongst the living.
Very good. Well, I think I can say with complete honesty: I've never heard of any of you.
Good way to get your head blown off.
I never saw you --
I was chasing after somebody I saw in the salon.
Don't think so. Stay the fuck back.
The lockdown thing.
It better be -- he still owes me $25 grand for renting the place for the night! Here, let's get you some illumination so you can make your way safely!
What's going on?
Well, then, how 'bout maybe we call someone?
I said we shouldn't come down here. Very treacherous -- physical and metaphysical levels, both. There've been no refurbishments to this part of the house -- it's exactly as it was in 1931.
Not ghosts... at least not what you're thinking... Vannacutt used to dump the bodies of his failed experiments somewhere in the house...
I thought you understood.... It's the souls of Vannacutt's dead... The insanity... The horror... Victims burned alive... All that pain percolating somewhere in the house for seventy-some years...  ...singing this will be the day that I die... This will be the day that I....
Oh, dear.
What's the matter?
What was her name?
Suppose not.
What will they tell you?
Thank you.  If you told me two years ago we'd be living here, I would never have believed it.  Do you live around here?
So was I.  The usual investigation turns up nothing more times than not.
I'm sorry.
It's origin is unknown.  The symbol does correspond  to a dagger I acquired many years ago.
She talks to me.
Ok...
Go to your room!  Now!
Sure.  Did you see the others?
Aubrey knows more about us than you think.
Were you fooling with the power?
It was in the cellar.  Weird.
So what are you saying?
You, an imaginary friend.  That's what she calls her.
Ok...
Know what?
I'm all right...
We're usually successful in detecting the source of most problems.  Unfortunately.
We usually find nothing.  We've debunked many a reported haunting. About ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation.
If we have a troubled spirit here, we have to find out why it's troubled.
Before.
It was a shame.
Come back to us honey!
Thank you.
And what would you do?
Yeah?  Well, you just struck out.  It may be a surprise to you, Brad, but I want to do it the right way.  Not tight skirts.  Tight stories.
I know what I saw.
Captain Spenser.  Elliott.  I ... What the Hell is going on?
What happened to him?
Right.
What is it?
I'm trying to quit.
Right ... That's ... er ... that's nice of you, Terri.  Can I ask?  Is it always this ... exploratory?
Guys.  Sometimes friends.  Mostly guys.
No.  I buy them to impress people.  Of course I've read them.
I don't think so.  But it's a fascinating subject.  Did you ...
Maybe not.  But you know more than I do. You know something about this box. Something about a statue?
Woah.  Wait a minute.  Who?  The kid?
I don't know.  Maybe.
And this is your club.  Great club.  I really love it here.  Great club.
Thank you for the drink.  And the rose. Wow.  That's ... really nice.
I'm sorry.
Unh-unh.
And tomorrow I'll give one to somebody else.  Get dressed.  Get out.
Right.  Like you were hog-tied or something.
No.  But, as you can see, I'm having some work done on it.  You found a real treasure for me, Terri.  I hope I can show you how grateful I am.
Yeah, a girl I know helped smarten it up.  Put her heart and soul into it.
Hudson, God's given you a gift for cat burglary, you can t just...
Show off.  Hey, boss tune.  "Come Fly with Me."
Sure.  That's why his meatballs are made out of marinated Chuck Wagon.
Just means it'll take you an extra 31 seconds to seduce.  You re still the best, I know it.
Rutherford Auction... that name...
Hey, you promised......Don't worry, I'm wearing my girdle.
No need.  Guards' station's right there.
"Every day you meet quite a few."
That's the best kind.  A wise woman once said "Polite conversation is rarely either."
Oh, why couldn't I be the Cardinal in charge of catering.... If the Mayflowers get the three sections of Da Vinci's crystal and his instructions for the gold machine-- Aie-yi--Do we got anything?  What of Alex, Hawk's friend, where is his loyalty?
I'm sorry for losing it back there, but you must remember, sister, you have vows to God as well as a mission to the world.
Excuse me, Milady.  I would have flown over and carried you up to a pink cloud, but I left my cape at the cleaners.
Delivers up to ten at night.  The Pope has an obsession with his Easter Seals.  It's actually not that an unusual set-up.  The secret passageway on the other hand....
I never break a date.  Scout's honor.
Ooh, I guess I do know something Here's looking at you, kid...
Oh.  Well, what's this?
Yeah, but what would happen if that little mirror came out of the crystal.
Oh Lord.... the only reason I ask is that Hudson, uh, Mr. Hawk, Hawkins, had some "neat" things to say about Darwin, Minerva, and you. Basically that you're part of the same car pool.
I don't care.
Market crashes.  Bomb drops. Greenhouse effect affects.  We'll still be the richest, most powerful people in the world.  In 1992, Europe is coming together to become one business superpower.  It's one party we'd love to poop.
We're here to say, your government was right.
Whatever.  You own Boardwalk, you own Park Place, you own the four railroads.  You think you're God. For all I know, you're probably right.  I just wanted to have a damn cappuccino, maybe play some Nintendo after I find out what it is.  Man, why didn't you just <u>buy</u> the horse?  What am I saying, you did buy it...
How was I supposed to know they were women?  Besides one of them was bald and kept saying "Soitinly."
Yes.
Weren't you the bartender at Jonestown?
When it rains, it pours.  Name's Snickers.  The plane leaves in 40.
Good news, bud, the Mayflowers have moved up the time-table. You're hitting the Vatican to-night.
Bastard!  If you were a true American.
Too bad.
You just might.  I'm the guy who tricked you into robbing a government installation and then had you sent to prison for it.  At the time, I was bald with a beard, no moustache, and I had a different nose, so if you don't recognize me, I won't be offended.
Tell me about it...
The Dancing Dingus!
Sharp.
We dumped the whole load. Now quit showboating, Addison --
Well, that even surprised ole Moses at fust. I didn't think the Board was that smart.
Not at all. You're light as a feather.
Oh sure, you're biased -- you're a fellow Muncian. But would an imbecile come up with this?
Yeah, you know. Suffers from one of these complexes they have nowadays. Seems pretty obvious, doesn't it? She's probably very unattractive and bitter about it.
I know that, Amy.
I understand that you're not very skilled yet in the secretarial arts. I'm not that skilled as president. Oh sure, I put up a big front --  -- not that everyone's buying it.
Didja ever go to the top of old man Larson's feed tower and look out over the town?
No! In Vidalia! Farm Route 17!
Every year?
Oh no, Amy, pardon me for saying so but I find that very farfetched.
Know about it? You think the Board would do anything like this without my authorization? No, this was my idea from the start.
Yeah, well, monkey or not I'm still editor of this rag. Amy, I thought you were doing that piece on the F.B.I. -- J. Edgar Hoover: When Will He Marry?
Whatever. That's what sells newspapers.
I --
Fired! You're fired! Is that plain enough for you, buster!
Get up!
Nah, that's all forgotten.
But he told me you stole that swell hoop idea from me. What gives!
I don't care if you're president of the company! I need that voucher! Now!
That must have been quite a disappointment, Mrs. Mussburger.
I --
Wait a minute!
Well, I made the dean's list.
No, sir.
Oh my God, sir!
Damnit, where's my car!
-- So if you think it's appropriate, I'd like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch --
Well... I'm for it...
Yeah, tell me about it.
Ya get the special?
Maybe he's wise.
He notices.
She's damn good, Lou.
Thank you for waking me.
Alive?
You mean a figurehead.
I'm afraid so.
Oh, Mrs. Rand --
You've never said anything about voodoo before, Mrs. Rand.
I don't mean believe, like believing in a religion.  I mean, do you believe it has power?  Do you think it could heal a sick person?
You must, Betsy. They'll have to believe you.
I don't know.  I prefer to think of her as a sleepwalker who can never be awakened -- feeling nothing, knowing nothing.
It's the very danger itself that makes the cure possible, Mr. Holland.  The insulin produces a state of coma, a stupor.  The patient is revived from the coma by a violent overwhelming nerve shock. That nerve shock can kill -- but it can also restore the damaged mind.
At the Memorial Hospital -- here in Ottawa.
That's rather nice, isn't it?
I went to school in Buffalo.  Paul went to school in England.
Of course.  It's been nice of you to spend this much time with me.
I was just beginning to wonder. Aren't there shops, restaurants and things?
By a curious coincidence, it's my day off, too.
Did you hear what he sang?
Please, Wes, do as I ask.  You must rest, you must sleep.
No, thank you.  Tomorrow's time enough for you to begin work.
A woman crying?  No one's been crying here.
If I were as timid as you seem to think, Mr. Holland, I wouldn't have gone into the tower in the first place.
Of course not!
I'm sorry...
Mrs. Holland must have been beautiful ---
Well, I had a good time up to a point.
She is alive, Mr. Holland -- that's all.
I imagined this so differently...
And instead,  I came -- bringing you nothing.
Because you wanted to give my wife back to me?  Why should that mean anything to you?
I want you to be safe, Betsy.  I want to know you're away from this place -- home again, where nothing can harm you -- nothing and no one.
It's more than that, Doctor.  I've entered into their ceremonies - pretended to be possessed by their gods...
In view of all the circumstances, the commissioner has decided on a legal investigation.
Of the nature of Mrs. Holland's illness.  And, of course, the events which led up to it.
I did everything I could to forestall this, Paul.  I don't think there's any question of your innocence in the matter.  But there's been too much talk.  The thing's out of hand.
Emotion tricks all of us, Mrs. Rand.  And you are a woman with a very strong conscience.  That conscience has been tormenting you. The rest is coincidence.  There is no such thing as a Zombie.  The dead do not come back to life. Death is final.
No.  You're quite wrong.  Right here's the seat of the trouble. Mrs. Holland has become an object of speculation and religious interest to these people.  It's revived all their old superstitions -- Zombies -- and that sort of nonsense.
Foolish?  Tell them how foolish it is, Paul -- tell them!
You want to go?
Hmm. Good night.
I'm just sad Ben -- I mean it was... you were, but, you know. I just don't know...
Leave it -- I'll wash it for you.
So what were you doing in the Williams' basement anyway?
Oh right. The mustache coffee cup. The one that was sitting on the dash.
What's on your mind? Don't --
Listen, Elena, if you're gonna pull that passive aggressive stuff on me again --
What else could I be? What else could I be? We're not living in the real world here. You're living out some fantasy land from the past, or some advice or something from those psychoanalysts... there are some hard facts here.
I know, I know. I had no idea --
Ben, I've got a ride home. Maybe you should sleep this one off on the couch here?
Ben.
Ben, I don't think he wants us here.
Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right?
Lab experiments? Right smart guy -- Paul, you know your mother's gonna be disappointed not to see more of you -- In fact, let me make this more than a simple request guy, I think you should...
Sure dad.
What do you think we're doing, dad?
Who else would I be talking to? And take that thing off!
C'mon.
-- Waiter! Where's my cobb salad?  You want advice Ben? If your big brother were still alive I'd have him go out into the back yard and beat some sense into your head. Look kid, you married that woman against my advice --
That's besides the point. The point is if I'd had any sense in me I'd have divorced your mother 40 years ago, and that's the truth, and here it is, 1972 --
I thought I'd start trying. If you don't mind. But I am going to Florida and I do have a new nurse.
Thanks for the advice Dave.
A key party?
You couldn't have hoped for much better when you came up the walk.
My husband is probably passed out in the bathroom, or at least he wishes he were. I've been married to him for 17 years and I don't have any intention of going in there to get him... so what I'm proposing is that since your wife has gone off with a boy, and since you are standing here alone, I'm proposing that you and I do what makes sense. Stay warm. Pass some time. That's all.
What the hey. Let's go for a drive.
Nah, that wasn't in the contract.
With Mikey?
Is it a big party? A big neighborhood party?
Thanks for eating it. I don't know why I even pretend I can cook.
I suppose my reluctance was the group aspect of it -- I've never been much of a joiner, although I still consider myself a somewhat religious person --
Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep.
I gotta get to English class.
Like into one of the other 20 or so bathrooms they've got in this place.
Pharmaceutical! You are a god.
Major.
Groovy.  Young master of the revels, a treat for our hostess?
Let's see!
Hell, I guess he takes after me, huh?
You know, it's the whip -- the one uncle Frank got me from Mexico.
That's good, because I don't think Libbets is capable of the sex act.
They did it last year too. It's like traditional or something. They've got this humongoid Park Ave apartment and she just holes up there with a wad of cash.  Aren't the hugely wealthy sad?
Since he sleeps with every girl you ever show an interest in, why don't you just keep your Libbets thing a secret from him?
Yeah?
Sure, anything but this English.
Yeah. When it freezes, I guess that means the molecules are not moving. So when you breathe, there's nothing in the air, you know, to breathe in to your body. The molecules have stopped. So it's clean.
Then why'd you come after me?
I dunno. I --
I don't know.
Yeah.
Charles. Have you been keeping out of my shit? Have you refrained from entering the sacred precincts of my room?
Greetings, Charles.
Dad's like doing his Up With People routine, mom hasn't been saying much.
Libbets? What kind of a name is Libbets?
What time is it?
What are you doing at home on a Friday night?
Hey Sandy, what were you blowing up out there? Your mom was pretty p.o.'d.
One more shot?
Maybe you could drive him to Spencer's.
Detective Eckhart!  I know!  Welcome to Nightmute!
Actually...
Don't worry about him...
But there wasn't any...
The bartender at Darrow's.  He was there Friday night.
Okay.
Isn't that the difference between a good cop and a bad cop?  A good cop can't sleep 'cause a piece of the puzzle's missing.  A bad cop can't sleep 'cause his conscience won't let him.  You said that once, remember?
Worth pursuing?
No fibers, skin flakes, hairs...
Has her books in it.
Mrs. Connell found this copy in the house.  It's signed.  Personally.
She flattered me about my writing.  Asked if she could visit me.  To talk about my books.
How do you mean?
Seven years.
You know what about.
Will?
Huh?
The other guy?
You don't know.
Thought you wanted something fun...
Who?
No back-up.
Procedure went out the window a long time ago.
Yes, and very beautiful.
Ah! You have questions?
And no vampire here has discourse with God or the Devil?
Listen to me.
I could give you reasons. Her silence. Her youth. It's forbidden to make so young, so helpless, that cannot survive on its own.
Follow me - that way - through my cell -
I can't save her.
I don't believe you. I do not have to read your soul to know that you lie.
Yes you are, my dearest. You are mine and Louis' daughter. You see Louis was going to leave us. He was going to go away. But now he's not. He's going to stay and make you happy.
I didn't realise.
You dress me like a doll. You make my hair like a doll. Why?
Is that supposed to frighten me?
Yes. It killed them, unfortunately. But it keeps the blood warm.
Sit still. It's not finished -
Claudia - don't -
And it means something else too, doesn't it? I shall never, ever grow up.
He'll never let us go.
And suppose the one who made him knows nothing and the vampire who made him knows nothing, and it goes back, nothing proceeding from nothing, until there is nothing! And we must live with the knowledge that there is no knowledge.
I can't. Go away from me.
Yes...
They are here. I know they are. Listen for something that doesn't make a sound.
How devilishly clever.
And no one knows but us...
No, you would not, Louis. Danger hold you to me.
That's not so.
So you felt it too!
Give it to me!!!
I want it!
You're the devil, aren't you? That's who you are.
But why do you want me?
Dying?
It can't be...
I can't.
But you must know something about the meaning of it all, you must know where we come from, why we...
Vampires are killers. Predators, who's all seeing eyes were meant to give them detachment.
I know. Let her alone.
What are you saying?
You remember how you wanted her, the taste of her -
That's enough, cherie. Stop before the heart stops.
She would sleep in my coffin, daily, curl her child's fingers round my hair as she dreamt of I know not what...
Are you mad????
Don't fear me, Lestat. I bring you no harm.
You know I love the dark. But there's no dark anymore.
That's what I do. I interview people. I collect lives. F.M. radio. F.F.R.C. I just interviewed a genuine hero, a cop who -
So shall we begin?  What do yo do?
Yes but you needn't worry about that now. Things change.
We can't begin this way. Let me turn on the light.
The same way you do it. A series of simple gestures. Only I moved too fast for you to see. I'm flesh and blood, you see. But not human. I haven't been human for two hundred years.
Oh, that rumour about crosses?
I was human then. Might as well ask can an angel feel love. Both are blesses or cursed with a certain... detachment. Though whether angels take as long to learn it as I, I will never know.
Where would she have gone? She was a child, and beautiful, heartbreaking merciless child. And I had made her that...
Peasant rumours, superstitions about garlic, crosses, stakes in the hear, all that - how do you say again? Bull shit. But one of our kind? Not a whisper.
What about a radio?
Not possible, I'm afraid. The last ferry left hours ago. And we got a storm coming. There won't be another one for days.
What are you doing in my closet?
Yeah, right -- whatever.
Yet. Nothing yet.
Ray, come on. I want us to be together.
He said he'd try. Try is like maybe. Try is nothing!
Karla! You promised.
The dockhand guy. Hanging by his neck from up there.
Some.
Rio isn't the capital of Brazil. It was the wrong answer. Sorry, we lose.
We'll be better off in the open. If we stick together, maybe we can kill this creep for good.
I've got to see.
No, you're not.
You're okay. Thank god.
Why are you being like this?
It's okay.
What? The Bahamas? You're kidding.
Will you try...for me, please?
Oh...it's not working right. You're home early.  Did I scare you?
Hey -- I didn't know you were here. It's okay.  We got the refrigerator in. Come see.
It's gonna be great.
Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature.
It can't get worse. I mean, it's not like this was the first time I freaked out in class. I hardly ever get a full night's sleep, my grades suck, I'm this close from being thrown out of school.
It's...the anniversary. That's what's going on...Take it easy on yourself.
I'm okay.
It beets being on the mainland.
It's...him.
Hey, you don't have to appologize to me. I'm the one. I understand.  I'm going to take a walk and dry off.
It's in my room!
Did you get help?
He's in it with Willis?
Me, me, me. It's always about you. I'm having bad dreams. I can't sleep. I'm not doing well in school. I'm having trouble with my boyfriend.
Why? Come on, Julie. Think. You'll get it. Will Benson -- Ben's son.
I'll talk real slow.
Come on, I'll take a break and we'll all dance.
Baby, I finally got you alone in this Jacuzzi and I don't wanna be discussin' hair care.
I'd hate for you to have to blow...your whistle.
I don't know, but I'm starving.
He's probably the only one who can help us.
Well, Karla, what're you doin' at home over the long fourth weekend?
Make it three hundred. And throw that in, too.
They're all dead...Dead, I tell you.  Ahhhh, we're all deaaaddddd. Tyrellll, joinnnn usss.
You know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression --
Yeah, wait right here, it's the safest place.
This is General Nikolas Pherides, Commander of the Third Army. I'm Oliver Davis.  To be perfectly frank with you, we didn't expect to find anyone living here.
Drunk again?
Don't bother. Go to bed and get some sleep. I'll be working late.  I can hear any movement down here.
May life be good to you both. As for the others —— they will be quiet here —— and I will be with them.
They used to believe that sort of thing in the mountain villages. Some still do --
All the graves?
I'll get Ida to make up your bed.
That was my companion. She sings little peasant songs quite nicely -- a completely untrained voice, of course.
Of course. Tomorrow, perhaps, before I go?
How could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..
I don't know now without my father.
She has never mentioned her family.
And the soldier -- He looked at me so strangely -- who is he?
Thea is an orphan.
My last name is Pherides.
You were father's secretary -— I never thought - -
I don't understand you.
Never fear -- when you are dead you will remain dead. I will see to it that you do not walk about again. I promise you that. There is another one here who can not die. I will watch you both. Never fear.
This girl -- Thea —- is not a servant in my household, sir. She is my daughter's companion. Now, sir, if you'll excuse me, I'll go have a look at Mr. Jacks.
I heard the same sound at Ladysmith, at Nukden, Port Arthur.  What do you expect after a battle?
There's no one there -— nothing but the caves and the dead.
It doesn't seem to bother you much, General.
Thea?
Oh, now —— now look here ——
You are my friend.
Come —- you'll feel yourself again as soon as we get off this dismal island.
Not Theodosia. Theodosia's daughter -- your daughter.
You see? Thea believes it, too!
He hates all my race.
Who?
Bert, what's happened to this house? Where's Mary? Where's my kids?
Carter –– bank examiner.
I said I wish I'd never been born.
Well, I had a car, and it was right here. I guess somebody moved it.
It isn't me!
No wonder you jumped in the river.
Made what?
Why? Don't they believe in angels?
Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.
Sit down? What are . . .
Oh, I forgot. You haven't got your wings yet. Now look, I'll help you out. Concentrate. Begin to see something?
Well, wait and see.
Yes, but George . . .
Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey, and you'll get your wings.
It was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization.
You can keep him on. That's all right. As secretary you can hire anyone you like.
Because, you know, sir, he's got the I.Q. of a rabbit.
Well, what happened to you?
Will you try to get some sleep?
I own the house. Me, Giuseppe Martini. I own my own house. No more we live like pigs in thisa Potter's Field. Hurry, Maria.
Nice girl, Mary.
Can you give me one good reason why you shouldn't call on Mary?
Hmmm?
No, sir.
No.
Aw, get going!
Hope you enjoy it.
No. No.
I say, maybe you were born older. I suppose you've decided what you're going to do when you get out of college.
Pop, do you want a shock? I think you're a great guy.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Hello, Violet.
What do you want to do, hock your furs, and that hat? Want to walk to New York? You know, they charge for meals and rent up there just the same as they do in Bedford Falls.
How do you do.
And then I got scared, George, and closed the doors. I . . . I . . . I . . .
This way.
You see, if you shoot pool with some employee here, you can come and borrow money. What does that get us? A discontented, lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class. And all because a few starry-eyed dreamers like Peter Bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas. Now, I say . . .
Would I?  You're not talking to somebody else around here, are you? You know, this is me, you remember me? George Bailey.
Well, Mr. Potter, I . . . I . . . I know I ought to jump at the chance, but I . . . I just . . . I wonder if it would be possible for you to give me twenty-four hours to think it over?
I'd like to do that.
Well, why not? Can you think of anything better?
You've passed me on the street almost every day.
Uh-huh.
Beautiful.
I don't know. Maybe I will say it. How old are you anyway?
Oh, no. Just right. Your age fits you. Yes, sir, you look a little older without your clothes on.
What is it you want, Mary? What do you want? You want the moon? Just say . . .
Gesundheit. This requires a little thought here.
Have you made up your mind?
Tuesday.
That does it –– come here.
Remember the night we broke the windows in this old house? This is what I wished for.
Left them at the office.
Huh?
With butter, if they got any....
But of course.
I'm supposed to.
Someone pop your balloon?
Stop paddling!
Swim for it!
They're moving pretty fast.
Yeah.
Yee-hah!
Shells and lobsters and stuff?
No big thing, we'll see who's out there, maybe picnic.
Too hot in the lighthouse?
Listen to Andy, Sean.
Gangway, Turkies!
Anyone got another set of sails?
N-o-o-o-o-o-o....
Aren't you off-duty?
Happy to do it.
Could you just keep that crowd back, please?
You didn't miss much.  Christ, what a mess.
The woman passenger on the boat that blew up.
The drugstore's closed?  What the hell time is it?
Never mind that shit.  Just point.
Got it.
Oh, c'mon.
You stay right here.  You're going in with me.
Pop.  I'm sorry.
Sean's still out there.
You said something about a camera.
Look -- I just got this from Phil Fogarty.  It was in the camera belonging to the missing divers. It proves I was right, all along.
You don't make enough.
What's that supposed to mean?
After we've looked, we'll talk.
I know that this was probably a Great White Shark.  Car-cadon... Caradan....
Because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish....
Jesus, don't quibble with me.  I want to know if a Great White Shark did this.
Late.
My boss and your boss.  Sure.
Why?
MMMmmmorning....
For me?
He wanted a job, he's got one.  I want to see that boat out of the water by tomorrow night.
Are you going to be able to sleep?
No sweat.  A blessing in disguise. Back to the city, you can go to Bloomingdale's without waiting six hours for the ferryboat...we're surrounded by water here, you realize that?  Me, surrounded by water...Ridiculous.
I try.  Goddamnit, I tried...Now, I'm tired...I can't keep fighting it...I'm too tired...I'm...I'm....
Going out.
We have to do something.
It's still a good idea.
Please, Larry -- there's good reason. Those water skiers....
10-4,   soon as I can raise him.
Affirmative, affirmative.  Turn the Kids day-sailing back to port.  I heard you.  Patrol out.
Brody?  This is Patrol Base.
That's what he said.
No.  Find your brother, okay?
You stay with Mrs. Silvera, Tootsie. Okay?
Sure they did....
Oh, yeah.  So why aren't they doing it now?
Great.
Waiting for Andy.
Ready?
Help!  Help!
3:30.
The tide's running.  It'll take us to the light.
Anything?
Uh.  Well.  Maybe you could give Polo a hand going in....
When are we going out?  You and me?
Would you take him?
Len, can I see you a minute?
How the hell do we get him down. from there?
He thought he had a good reason.
Look, what am I supposed to do? It's done, it's over.  We have to deal with the consequences.
I know, but you're just going to have to find another way.  So you better start.
No.
Don't let him get you.  Just continue your patterns and pretend he's not around.
Honey, I gotta go.
We play hide and seek all the time.  They find a lot of things.
Look, Michael... you don't have to come.
Hi, baby.
That's a lot of ground to cover.
Up.
What's that?
Get some sleep.  And tell Sean I'm sorry.
How's your patient?
No,  I'm not going through there.
I have to get out of here.
... Okay.
But you --
I want that shark, Kathryn.
Only to myself.
On the telly.  We're to film him for the evening news.
Fine.  Have them do some.
It's one of the world's greatest creatures.
We're taking that shark alive!
Should be coming out of it soon.
Thanks for helping.
So do I.  But for different reasons.
Skillful?  I missed my first shot.
Somebody could have gotten hurt.
You're a strange man, Mr. Hutton.
And big for his age.
Massachussettans aren't.
Well, wait till you see the rest.
Goes back to when I was a kid. Mike's okay, he's gotten over his fears, but I haven't.  I can't even drink it.
No, Kelly, I don't want to...
Not for me.  I don't go in the water, remember?
Hold still, damn it!
Taking my boyfriend to the airport.
Now what?
Don't you dare.
Ohhhhh shhhhiiiit.
What?
It's disappeared.
Hey.
Yeah, tradition's a bitch, ain't it?
That's impossible.  If it's that big, why hasn't anybody seen it? Huh?  Tell me that.  It's like not seeing the Goodyear blimp in a swimming pool.
All right, hit those lights too.
Great.  I got one B, two C's, and eight incompletes.
So was Dad.
Don't hurry back.
We're in love.
No, really.  I've never met anyone like her before.  This is it.
But you always let me....
We need beer....
Tell Matt he should be here....
My brain is shrinking.  There's only so much room.
We don't have anything straightened out.  You're uptight about something ...what's wrong?
Then don't come any closer.
They're at the beach....
How could you do that?  Your own daughter....
I shouldn't interfere...  My mother-in-law is so neat she puts paper under the cuckoo clock....
You caught me....
I'd be afraid of losing....
It's beginning....
You rigged it...You spent all that money on an education and you come back looking like this....
Bang sticks are like yelling at it....
Hello?  Thea who?  I know it's Thea Brody.  How many grandchildren do I have?  I know you can use the phone by yourself. You're a big girl.  I know you're five.
You can stay in my room.
It's too dangerous....
Where's the lady who brings the soda?
Thank you....
Who's coming?
I'm just getting started....
It picked Sean...It killed your father....
Once he locked himself in the bathroom and your grandfather had to get the ladder and climb in through the window....
Mom, please don't start that again....
I am.
You just got here....
I'm fine....
I m not unhappy.  Frustrated maybe... Discouraged a little.  It'll work out....
There's nothing to worry about....
I'm going to finish what Jake and I started.  I owe him that.  Hell, I owe him everything....  I'll get something important done for both of us....
It could have been an accident....
Doesn't matter....
One time I was flying supplies up the Amazon.  Went down in the jungle....
They took me to the chief, who took a long look at me, then took me in his hut....
Sharks come and go, Ellen.  People don't have anything to do with it....
You're not going to bet it all....
I have my own little island.
Won't you get in trouble...?
How come it bumps up and down when there's no road?
I do....
A shark attacked Thea and some kids...She's going after it....
She'll be all right, partner.. She'll never find it.  We couldn't....
You sure you know how to do this.
All you passengers are the same.... Complain...Complain....
You don't have to say anything, Matt ...I know how you feel....
We'll be done pretty soon....
Oh, boy....
Put me down, damnit....
Where the hell's the beer...?
Forget it....
You're nothing but a bunch of goddamn romantics.  You're never going to amount to anything.
I've struck the mother-lode.  I'm counting... spade work....
What?
Don't say anything about this to my mother....
We don't write up anything until we're done....
We got it together, Jake....
My name goes on that report.  It's a half-assed job, I don't get my doctorate.  Neither do you....
Lots of times....
How long has he been here...?
Hoagie.
I'm going down, Jake....
I live to hear the sound...You all right?
Don't be so down, man.  Money's gone...Shark's gone...We're back to conch...We've got it made....
It'll work....
In a few minutes....
I just want to make an honest woman of you....
I'm training to....
When he has a pillow over his head....
Good night, Polly....
Gone to Ben Masters' place.  Cow tipping.
You heard. Look for the knife.
Uh huh .. He's well rehearsed ..
Watch my lips .. <u>Don't get into it</u> ..
I <u>am</u> stopping smoking ...
Why don't you dump the "Fat Lady?"
Thank Christ we got a witness.
No way .. not me, Mister. I'm not going up there again. Might find someone's prick in a hot-dog roll.
Listen to me saying what?
For a <u>dead</u> <u>dog</u>?
You looked like you did?
I'm asking it.
Are you sure you didn't call?
Hey, John, don't start getting antsy over this tonight. It may well have been the local cops?
Coz this is a major & we're closer to this bastard than anyone's ever been.
It's <u>her</u> hand. <u>Her</u> scars. <u>Her</u> dog. Her dog's shot. And she's missing.
That's bullshit,
You ain't talking to no one, till you calm down.
<u>If</u>, your friend from San Diego was up here, and thought for <u>one</u> out of <u>two fucken seconds</u>, she was a danger to him, he'da taken her out weeks ago ..
I've heard you call him Freddy.
I'm afraid I can't give you an ans- wer to that, Mr Goodridge. As I ex- plained to your secretary, we're do- ing a lotta looking, but we're not even sure it's her we're lookin for ..
I was hopin since we spoke that you might have remembered something that would give us an idea where she is?
As she's a member of my staff, may I ask what this is about?
I see .. Well, she's teaching an- other class at four .. I'd apprec- iate it if you don't detain her ..
What kind of friend? Was he a boy friend? An old friend? New friend?
No, it has a mind of its own.
No.
No, just a minute or two .. I knocked on your door - no one home, so I followed the music ..
I gotta admit, you're one of them. Just wish I knew what you meant by a "hollow car?"
You should. It's wonderful.
Yeah, that'll do .. Is that "Hamlet?"
Do you pray?
Which is what?
I know.
Alright, I'm worried about Christmas. I wish I hadn't told him I'd be back ..
It's not possible right now.
I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand.
Why does he want to kill me?
I can't identify him ..
Then why didn't he kill me?
I'm blind because my father drank.
You know, he crashed. He just couldn't come to terms with it .. John hates to lose, and he hated losing her .. Every spare minute, he's driving down to San Diego, having a terrible time with her, getting drunk, and driving back .. you just don't believe the amount he drank ..
Friday night at City Hall. Got a great chance to frighten the fat.
A derelict.
His father's the manager, Sir. The kid was up there shooting vermin, and he found the body.
Whatta you mean, "horrible?"
Don't worry about it -- I never told you what I thought of that memo either --
Everything's on the fucking run! Everything --
Hey, man, tonight I'm going to teach Ray about jazz.
Yeah, how'd it go with Sportboy?
You're imagining it.
Hmm.  Pretty good.
You think so?
Sure. Yes. Medical, I don't know.
Absolutely.
Same to you.
Hello?
I just got goosebumps.
Well, I'm happy for you.
Hi.
And I am...
I'm relieved you said that.
Oh good.
Yeah -- guess I got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster.  You meet Chad the nanny?
Bye you guys. _ 88.
Good night.
This rig? Phht.  No problem.
Look, just in case this weekend becomes next month and next month becomes... whatever...  Don't make a joke of your life. Go back and read what you wrote. You're better than the rest of them, better than the Bob Sugars, and don't forget it.
So this break... is a break-up.
No kidding.  I looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen.
Thank you.
But you just gotta hear me out on one thing.  You're very responsible with Ray and you know it's not right for a little boy to hear some strange man's voice in the house.
Oh, knock it off! _ 89.
-- well, Rod, your agent passed me a note before the show. He says that your deal memo has been signed by the Arizona Cardinals. Four years for ten-point-two million dollars.  Playing in the state where you grew up.
Ten seconds, Rod.
Do I know everything there is to know here?  You fellas aren't talking with Bob Sugar, are you?
I brought Denver to twenty million. Denver deals with me all the time. You listened to Sugar? You let that snake in the door.
Call me tomorrow.
Why not?
Uh, not today, but --
But how did you get "kwan?" _ 82.
You.
No, I'm saying to be --
Fine.
Forget it.  Forget it.
You're hanging by a very thin thread, dude.  And I dig that about you.
No, I don't know.
Hey, that's my word, okay?
No, you're --
Fine.
We still having dinner in L.A.?
--so our first date, she told me about her favorite place in the world, the seven pools of Hana on the island of Maui...
To the pools.  Now she's Miss Rock Climber, and I'm more the Non-Rock Climber, but we're hiking up through the pools and there's a fine mist in the air, and I have the ring in my pocket, and I'm a little nervous, I'm lagging behind, and she says to me, get this -- "Hurry up, klutz."
Jerry.  You two will be together forever.
Not a chance.
Damn right, and you can start by taking Rod's poster and putting it where people can see it!
Dick.
I'm over it.  Now I want all my clients and yours too.
-- and I'll get 'em.
Can you be quiet?
And tell your wife to stop making so much noise! We're food to these damn animals.
A few of us survived. A lot more died. And we were better prepared and better armed.  How many days have they been missing?
This is how you play God.
We even have two seats reserved aboard the first commercial moon flight.
Oh, don't worry about that.
It’s not about him. It's Eric. He's alone out here somewhere. Our baby is all alone.
He's this way.
Never had a doubt. Never did. Us Kirby men, we stick around, huh?
DAD!
Just hold on.
Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top.
We'll be broke in four weeks.
No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago some buddies and I went hang gliding off these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me right into the side. BOOM!
I don't think so.
Ah yes, the first rule of academics. Publish or perish.
Some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions. You rushed in with no thought to the consequences, to yourself or anyone else.  You're no better than the people who built this place.
Raptors, mostly.
You think they could talk to each other?
Any weapons, radios?
A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.
Are you sure?
Something must've scared them.
She's the one person I could always count on. And she's saved me more times than she realizes. I owe her everything.
No we're not.
The population will Stabilize eventually. They'll adapt to fit different roles.
No, no, see Dr. Grant, you're the best. You've seen these animals in the flesh. No one else has come close to you.
This plane can not land!
There is. I own a place called Kirby Paint and Title Plus. We're out in the Westgate Shopping Center in Enid, Oklahoma. The "plus" is for bathroom fixtures, fireplaces accessories, patio furniture. Stuff like that.
But you never came across just one.
Well, I'm a very well-funded old son of a bitch.  You go.
If the nest is upwind, so are we. When he comes back, he'll know we're here before we have a chance.  The truck --
No.  I feel something.
Light and strong, light and strong, sure, why not, it's only impossible. God save me from academics.
Because I didn't know!  I don't have the faintest idea what they're doing here.
It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are finally killing me.
That doesn't say a thing about T-rex, they could have been rogues.  Robert Burke certainly thinks they were.
Kelly!  What are you doing here?
My vacation is over in a week.
Okay.
My father's .600 Nitro Express.  Made in 1904.  Karimojo Bell gave it to him after he took down his last elephant.  8700 foot pound striking force.
I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.
Rex won't be any different.  It'll come.
Why?
It's just fed.  It won't attack unless it's threatened.  Don't move.
There are no versions of the truth! This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's my life.
Piss.
What do you think they want?!
Look, we have two choices.  We can hike back down to the lagoon, where we can sit for two days, in the open, next to a heavily used water source while we're waiting for your boat to arrive, or we can head for the village, where we might find some shelter and we can call for help.
But why?
What do you want to do, Ian, lock her up for curiosity?  Where do you think she gets it?
Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a high school vice-principal.
Ian's a very good friend of mine.
Oh, no!
Ian, nothing we observe will be valid if we're trailing along in the wake of an army.
We'll kill it with too much, we'll put it into respiratory arrest!  I'm almost done.  Damn it, I need another adhesive, something pliable I can --
You go if you like, but we're not waiting for you.  MOVE IT OUT!!
Runs against my nature to hole up in a cave and wait.
Damn!
Where did the vehicles stop?
Wait a minute.  What exactly does this mean?
'Bout thirty seconds.
Mr Nedry, Mr Nedry.  The embryos have to be back here in San Jose by then.
Uh - - anybody else think we shouldn't be out here?
Anybody at all.  Feel free to speak up.
A carousel - - and a seesaw.  They all moved, motorized of course, but people would swear they could see the fleas.  "I see the fleas, mummy!  Can't you see the fleas?" Clown fleas, high wire fleas, fleas on parade... 
John....
They died together?
Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr Ellie.....
It's my favorite.
- - barfs them up - -
You can't hold it by yourself!
The fences are electrified, right?
Why not?
Anti-nature.
Dinosaur eats man.  Woman inherits the Earth.
I'm still not clear on Chaos.
It changed.  Why?  Okay, back over your wrist.  Because and here is the principle of tiny variations - - the orientations of the hairs - -
Grant?  You'll never get him out of Montana.
That's conservative, of course.  There's no reason to speculate wildly.
Hey!  Where are the brakes?
Yes it is.
You're crazy!  I'm not gonna jump!
Occasionally.  Always on the lookout for the future ex- Mrs. Malcolm.
You haven't touched  didn't touch anything.  We're stopping.  We've stopped.
We gotta do something.
There's gotta be something - -
John Hammond.  And I am delighted to finally meet you in person Dr Grant.
- - this would be an awfully unusual time - -
Wu?
Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!
I'm trying to use psychology to get you out of the drain, you know!
No, I didn't hear anything.  No, we're okay.
Oh, I hate the other kind.
I'll stay awake.
You're a beautiful big animal.
Timmy, let go!  You're gonna have to let go!  Count to three.  I'll catch you.
You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!
Timmy, listen to Dr. Grant!
Yes.
John, John.
I will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you, Dennis.  I really will not.
Sure.
Turn it off, Lex!  Turn it off!
What if we fall?  I hate trees.
That was great!
I'm afraid I am gonna fall!
Shut up!  You're scaring me.  Stop!  You're scaring me.
Fifty? We need seventy-five.
And do you think they like the fact that half the country thinks Crystal Lake is filled with corpses?
Logging? We'll need an environmental impact study for that...
Just a deer, Mister Biller. Part of the local wildlife.
You learn something new every day. Let's go.
Mister Biller... now that we can see the lake, I think we should follow the shoreline to --
He... he's here...
That's right. Wasn't on any of the maps... we could barely see it through the underbrush. Place must've been abandoned for twenty years.
Take it easy, Ruby...	it's all right.  Now, try to think clearly... don't you mean _Jason's_ hand... don't you mean he grabbed a scalpel and slashed Doctor Layton's throat?
Insomnia. Not unusual for someone in his situation.  Not to mention he's a bed-wetter.
Simple. We sedate him, induce a somnolesent state, and study his REM patterns when he's unconscious.  If he has the disorder, his REMS will be highly abnormal. Ruby smiles.
That's open to debate.
Don't you see? Jason was _asleep_. And he was dreaming -- the REM patterns prove that. And I saw finger blades just like Krueger's come out of Jason's chest. There has to be a connection.
Yeah, what is it?
I'll have to lean on them pretty hard after what happened last night... but I think I can do it.  Let me know what happens.
Except this victim got away. I wonder if --
I don't know... but I think he's pissed.
Krueger's the greater danger right now. We have to stop him.  _Springwood_. That's where he'll go. That's where he's always gone.	But Springwood's not like Crystal Lake. There's a couple hundred thousand people there. He could be anywhere.
Let's split up. You take the left side, I'll take the right. We'll meet in front of the Cineplex.
You have been hearing the sordid side then.
What is it really?
Well, as long as I admire it from afar it shouldn't worry me if it's hollow.
-- Small.
Did you?
Success or nothing?
An empty tomb?
Not a chance.  I'm the thinnest person I know.
Yes.
I've never seen him.  I don't believe there is a keeper of the files.
He has it, he just hasn't noticed it yet, all right?
You must make the time.  Where do you go off to in the lunch hour?
I do.
I see -- it's just the Erlanger claim then.
I know.
I've never seen you here before.
That he was -- satisfied in that regard.  I didn't want to pry.
Eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing.
And you believe everything the authorities tell you.
Tonight?
And you ...?
What of it?
People must think the same of me -- a quiet, dependable person.
Burgel gave me this -- what does it mean?
I've heard of it happening.
Usually.
I told you, they're <u>dead</u>.  It's finished.
No, I suppose not.
Close only by virtue of antithesis.
It's all right to be sarcastic in private to us -- because we have a sense of humor -- but when we're up at the Castle we suggest you don't make a fuss.  It would spoil the not unfavorable impression you make in other respects.
When a scapegoat is needed, my friend ...
Yes, well -- we're looking for a new village now.  If we stay too long at one source ... people become suspicious.
It usually is.
He's the clerk who died last week. From the insurance department
Is your friend's name among them?  Then he only worked on the one case.  Your Chief will send me the final summation when he's finished with it.
Of course not.  Only by a Director of the firm.  Who'd want to let in all kinds of riff-raff off the streets?
Ludwig?
Look Mr Denham - you're not welcome here. Just pack up your cameras and go.
It's ... lovely.
A Neolithic bronze ... Reminiscent of the Nias Island cultures ... It ' s very curious. Defiantly Pagan. The use of ivory for the spear is quite unique ... What do you think?
Now now, Ann! Try be to polite.
It's ok.I know what you were feeling.
Ann ... you're father is dead. You have nothing to prove anymore.
I'm not sailing with this thing on board!
Jack!...  Jack!
What a climax to the film - The first white men to set foot on ...  "Skull Island"  Twentieth Century man comes face to face with a ... a ... naked stone age tribe!
Well, that was a monumental waste of time! I pay good money, only to be taken on some wild goose chase!  I made the mistake of trusting my idiot translator!
We offer ourselves at your service, Mr Denham!
That's too bad.
Yeah? ... Well, I gave 'em a taste of American lead ... and I don't see 'em coming back for seconds!
How about Ann? Is she going with you?
Yeah.
Please, if he sees you, he won't come!
Well -- well I'm just back. And -- I must tell you -- something quite wonderful.
Please --
Didn't want you.
Look -- could I use your phone?
We don't want to just lock him up; we want a conviction, we wanted him to do something more.
I guess he figured it was better.
Here please.
Will you let me go then?
Mm.
Isn't that sweet.  Well it could be any one of them bubi; I get to see them all.
-- Tuscarora --
But you can't say that Dumper was Tom Grunemann.
Just phone calls, right? They ring, you answer, they don't say anything, just blank. Kids getting kicks. Burglars looking for an empty apartment. I mean there is nothing that proves --
Tell me about Frank Ligourin.
Do you know where he got the dumper?
Is that what you gave him?
It was Jane McKenna who sent you the dumper.
You told me what you could. I guess I'm through with your part of it.
Well --
Mm.
Thanks for the jolly news. I thought maybe you'd left town by now. You kind of just disappeared. But you boys from Tuscarora have a habit of disappearing, don't you?
I told you before, you wouldn't understand.
We did this before.
I don't like getting splashed.
Yeah.
What am I supposed to say?
Drop it.
I am.
About what?
They don't scare me any more.
I believed her, Pete.
It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.
I could try Arlyn Page again. She saw much more of the Dumper than Bree Daniel.
How is it back there?
Someone's been doing all these things.
I'm meeting a man tomorrow night. He wants to meet me on East-River Drive -- he wants five hundred dollars for the book. Can you get that for me Pete?
Tomorrow evening, nine. East River Drive and 73rd Street.
It's not so bad.
What's in it?
I wanted to give it to you first.
Why didn't you tell Bree, afterwards?
He called this morning from Tuscarora. Asked me to meet him at 3:00 at the downtown heliport. He's on his way to Chicago.
Inspector we understand your position; ours is a little different. We have an investment in Tom Grunemann. The Company has an investment, and we feel entitled to investigate for ourselves.
Yes sir, we know he --
Yes?
The prospect of losing my child.
Playing.
In real life when does he hit you?
Soon.  Very soon.
That's right.  You're absolutely right...It's been a long time since I made French toast.
No.  If I'm not here, you go home with Thelma and Kim.
You got a letter from mom.
Can I be excused?  I'm not hungry.
I guess...
That's okay...
Sure.  Lots of times.
You like it?
Yep.
Sure.
Uh, huh?
Where will my toys be?
Mr. Kramer, isn't it true that you were fired from your last job not more than six weeks ago?
Then I have concluded my questions.
Yes.  I tried to talk to Ted-- my ex-husband--about it, but he wouldn't listen.  He refuses to discuss it in any serious way. I remember one time he said I probably couldn't get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby- sitter for Billy.
Yes, I work for Jantzen as a sportswear designer.
Your honor, I would like to place in evidence a report on Mrs. Kramer's therapy by her therapist, Dr. Elinore Freedman of La Jolla, California.
Because my son is here.  And his father is here.  As a mother, I don't want my child to be separated from his father.
How long do you plan to live in New York, Mrs. Kramer?
Objection!
It was good.  He was a hard worker, a lot of drive, a real hustler.
What?!  What do you mean, I don't understand.
Look, you don't understand.  I need a job.  I've got a kid and--
Call up the people at J. Walter Thompson.  Set up an appointment at four.
No.
No.
No.
How many lovers have you had-- permanently?
We were married two years before the baby.  And then four very difficult years.
Oh?  What do you call it then --a success?  The marriage ended in divorce.
Okay, I understand and I promise I won't try and stop you, but you can't just go...Look, come inside and talk...Just for a few minutes.
He is...  You sat in that coffee shop across from school--
Oh, God...Oh, my God...
I mean it Ted, you're running this one.
Me?  I've never been better. I mean having my wife walk out on me after seven years of marriage agrees with me just fine.
I'm going to be okay.  The way I see it, Joanna'll come home, it's just a matter of time.
I don't know, Jim...
Well, ah...I thought it over and I decided we're doing it Murray's way.
Are you firing me, Jim?
Yes, what?
I can't.  I've got Billy to take care of.
Oh, for God's sake, Kramer. You have got to be the world's most naive human being.  Murray has gone in and changed every single ad you've done on the entire Fire and Ice campaign. Every layout...Every idea...Every single thing, right down the line.
Right.
I'm going to take it.
I know....I know.
Fine.
Do you want the kid or don't you?
When Joanna--  my ex-wife--when she was talking before about how unhappy she was during our marriage...Well, I guess most of what she said was probably true.  There were a lot of things I didn't understand-- a lot of things I would do different if I could.  Just like I guess there are a lot of things Joanna wishes she could change...But we can't.  Some things, once they are done, can't be undone.  Joanna says she loves Billy.  I believe she does.  So do I.  But the way it was explained to me, that's not the issue.  The only thing that's supposed to matter here is what's best for Billy...When Joanna said why shouldn't a woman have the same ambitions as a man, I suppose she's right.  But by the same token what law is it that says a woman is a better parent simply by virtue of her sex?  I guess I've had to think a lot about whatever it is that makes somebody a good parent:
We can appeal, but I can't guarantee anything.
Six years.  Ever since Ted and Joanna moved into the building.
Oh, Christ.. .John, there's some- thing I ought to tell you.  My... ah, situation has...changed.  I lost my job.
Fuck you.  He's my son.  I'm staying with him.
OhmyGod.  Didn't she say anything? She must've said something.
Maybe she didn't feel like she should have to.  Maybe she felt like if you'd been paying any real attention to her to start with, maybe you would've noticed.
Ted, divorce is a terrible thing. I know, I went through it. You've got to believe I did everything I could to get Joanna to stay.  But I'll tell you something. You may not want to hear it, but it took a lot of courage for Joanna to do what she just did.
Got it.
No, not really...  I guess it's different if you don't have children, but...I dunno, even if Charley and I don't live together, even if we're sleeping with other people, even if Charley was to marry again...He'd still be my husband. That stuff about "Till death do you part?"  That's really true.
Three.  And add some basil.
Look,  I know this isn't gonna make any sense, okay?  I mean forget the logic part...But I keep thinking if Charley really loved me, he wouldn't have let me divorce him.
Uh, huh...
Here. We'll collect them.
It depends on the quality. And, that it be Indian.
The United Nations voted not to hear our appeal.
Not yet, but the Governor of Chamdo, Ngabo Jigme, suggests we must negotiate and offers to go to Peking.
Yes, but they say he did.
If I were to go into exile, could we expect any serious assistance, from India, suppose?
Yes, yes. Your brothers are here.
I am him.
So, Tibet, too, needs to define itself.
Britain?
Ask the Chinese mission to leave our country. Immediately.
At this point, the most likely result of a foreign pact is war.
Tibet, at war? No. China is close, America is far away. After countless people die, China would still, always, be close. We will work with what we have.
The Khamba's gun is his most prized possession. I admire them so. They face a modern, well equipped army, and still, they fight.
A beggar can be called a landlord if he disapproves of the Chinese.
The Communists put their guns in the hands of the Khamba children and force the child to kill the parent. They have dropped bombs on the monastery of Lithang in Kham. It has been destroyed. Women and children, trying to escape from the fighting, have been shot with machine guns, fired from airplanes.
The people will not allow it.
I will not go.
Good day.
Thank you.
For me, I think such a mix is crucial.
Is that a true story, or pretend?
True.
Why is your beard so funny? Let me touch this.
You cannot.
But, surely, we are safe in Tibet. We don't believe in killing.
Ahh.
Then, I am lucky. I am still too young.
No, Holiness.
The people will cry when they learn you are gone. But they would all want you safe.
Eliminate you.
Do you remember the day I came to your monastery, when I was a baby? And you comforted me?
It is possible, Holiness.
Completely.
Doubt is an affliction. Reliquish it. Accept.
My department doesn't have any record of that, Mrs. Bickerman.
Well, he was very ill and he refused to go see a doctor and well... I think he had Alzheimer's, he would be coherent one day, incoherent the next and one <u>coherent</u> day, he asked me to end his suffering.  I wouldn't <u>do</u> it but he kept insisting and insisting and deteriorating till the point the only cognitive thing he could really do was that I finish him off.  Finally I just gave in and hit him on the head with a skillet then buried him under the bulkhead.
You're to wait right here until the police show, you're under full house arrest.
He's not gonna hurt <u>me</u>.
No thank you, but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log.
I'm tired, Hector.  I know this because you're beginning to not bug me.
I don't know!
I have enough flaxedil with me to put him out.  And I think I know a way to--
You ready on shore?
Tranq guns down, rifles up!
What's going on?
You think I'm <u>that</u> nuts?
<u>Nothing's</u> real.  I'm rich, people are automatically my friends, sycophants ooze out like oil slicks and and and--
Oh, bullshit.
Can I tell them you won't go back in the water?
Yes, it <u>did</u> seem prehistoric but I'm sure he just carried the thing for luck.  Not that it <u>worked</u>, obviously.  It probably somehow got lodged into his body.
How would <u>you</u> know, what--
Because they just consult their little indigenous charts.
Skipping stones.  Look how flat that water is, you can get ten skips on a good one.
I beg your pardon?
I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--
I am going out on that boat and why are you picking on me, is this some kind of--
In his defense, every primitive culture known to man deified them. He's a mythology professor, he thinks crocs are divine conduits.
Good.  See ya soon.
That's probably good.
Yeah.  I got some stuff for your cut.
It's okay.
Just gotta pull it a little tighter.
Ssssh!
<u>No</u>.  I keep getting hit with heads!
You calm down!
You wouldn't?
But we do.  Hey, we'll always have Maine.
Alright, Ms. Paleontologist.  I wanna know why that monster is here.  You got a theory?
Other than to eat us?
Where is he?!
<u>There</u>?  That's the morgue.
Sorry.  I'm just a little unclear as to why the Museum of Natural History would send somebody here.
Lightweight Forward Area air device unit.  Whatever's out there, one shot with this and he's dead.
Was he swallowed?
Yes, <u>camp</u>, I thought that meant Holiday Inn, I never heard "tents", will there be toilets?
I thought I saw...
Crocodiles.  He's an expert on them.  And if he's <u>here</u>... then he must think that's what's in this lake.
Hector thinks you like him.
I guess.
The somebody else part?
Kevin.  How's it going, what's happenin', family good, great, nice to catch up, get out.
A tooth?
Kelly--
I <u>tapped</u> you.
Kevin told me you were upset.
It was just a quick thing which we thought was over, and and...
Thanks, Ardelia.
Pleading with a crazy man, with come all over my face.
He's here, Ardelia.
The one that was weighted down. Where is she...? Fred something.
You might have suggested that in my office, and saved me the time.
Starling -
I won't disturb anything, Mr. Yow, I promise. Be gone before you know it.
Oh my! Oh my... Maybe you better come out now, Miss Starling.
No. Wait... Was she a great, fat person? I may have seen her, I'm not sure...
Yes sir.
And what is that, sir?
It's all there, sir, practically verbatim.
To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir -
Sir, what is it? There's something you're not telling me.
You haven't said a word today about that garage. Or what I found there.
They weren't there. Get close-ups.
I'm wondering if he's done that before - placed a cocoon, or an insect. It would be easy to miss in an autopsy, especially with a floater... Can we check back on that?
Or just as worthless. But I want you in Memphis, close to him. Maybe when he gets tired of toying with Senator Martin, he'll talk to you again. There's a plane waiting for you now at the airstrip.
Good idea. Meantime, try to get a feel for Catherine Martin. Her apartment, her friends... how he might've stalked her. I'm going to the other two clinics, Minnesota and Ohio.  Now's the hardest part, Starling. Use your anger, don't let it keep you from thinking. Just keep your eyes on Catherine. We've got less than 30 hours.
Johns Hopkins finally came up with a name for us. We fed him into Known Offenders, and he came up cherries.  Subject's name is "Jamie Gumb," AKA "John Grant." Lecter's description was accurate, he just lied about the name.
Not lately. But maybe someday.
May I see your credentials?
All that detail, just from memory...?
No. I only hoped that your knowledge -
A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti... Fly back to school, little Starling.
Why don't you tell me about "Miss Mofet?" You wanted me to find him. Or do I have to wait for the lab?
Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated.
Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You know, don't you?
Buffalo Bill...?  Bill killed him, all those years ago...? That's impossible.
Big through the hips. Roomy.
Mmm. And what else...?
Was it a butterfly?
Tell me. Don't lie, or I'll know.
After your father's death, you were orphaned. What happened next?  I don't imagine the answer's on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.
A cattle ranch?
How long did you live there?
How very thoughtful... Or did Crawford send you here for one last wheedle - before you're both booted off the case?
I've studied the case file, have you...? Everything you need to find him is right in these pages. Whatever his name is.
No! That's incidental.
Tell me his name, Dr. Lecter.
Dr. Lecter -
You have my word. Paul?
Did you breast-feed her?
We leave in the morning?!
Well that is to be expected. My father...
Top of this ridge. Fort and Lake George are downhill of it.
Because what I am interested in is right here...
"Justice"?  If that's "justice"..., then the sooner French guns blow the English army out of America, the better it will be for these people.
Yes I do! I know exactly what I am saying.  And if it is sedition, then I am guilty of sedition, too!
Cora, in my heart, I know once we're joined, we'll be the happiest couple in England. Let those whom you trust, your father, help settle what's best for you. In view of your indecision, why not rely on their advice and judgment as well as mine?
Munro is expecting him to be the good soldier in defense of British military interests.
What the bloody hell plan is this?
He is Huron and nothing else.  Why would he want to murder the girl?
Do not let gratitude get in the way...
This is it, as far as we can go... If we're lucky, they'll be figurin' we can't have come this way and must've beached our canoes and headed cross land. If we're very lucky, they'll figure we went over the falls.
... and while they are cooped up in your fort, what if the French send war parties to raid their homes?
Tradin' your skins in Castleton?
Out the northern sally-port. Strike for the east side of the swamp until you clear the French picket line. Head north over the ridge, then come about southeast and fork left in Little Meadow and you're free of the outpost and skirmishers...
No.  Huron serve no one. The French father believes he fooled Magua because he is so proud of his cleverness, he is blind. But it is the Huron path that Magua walks down, not the French one... Now, Les Francais, also, fear Huron. That is good. When the Huron is strong from their fear, we will make the terms of trade with Les Francais. And we will trade as the white man trades. Take land from the Abnakes; fur from the Osage, Sauk & Fox. And make the Huron great. Over other tribes. No less than the whites, as strong as the whites.
...not enough time to get to Albany and back with reinforcements...
Ambush... on the George Road. This Magua led us into it.  ...eighteen killed. It's these men who saved us. They guided us here...
General Webb can burn in hell. We'll go back and dig our graves behind the ramparts! Our mission is to fight.
The decision is final.
Fire!!!
Sir!
Atten-hut!
Yes.
They may leave the fortress fully armed, but with no ammunition... Other than that, ask what you wish.
Carry them to England to your King with pride.
These observers were doing something. A test...I think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes.
He did.
And they didn't believe the symptoms I described...
But what about those scales... or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb?
Intelligence may not be the right word...
Don't worry, I don't want to give up any more.
What has?
Were, Doss <u>were</u>.
He did.
What dead one on the ship?
No.
Fuck your orders!
What?
Roger...  More light, Sixpack...
Well, I always heard you don't "learn" leadership, you earn it.  How did you know they'd get into the vodka?
Maybe you're more one of us than you think...sir.
Seeing how my stock's doing...
Where's Doc?!
Mr. Beck, the contract states that no body can be disposed of without authorization of---
What's your air reading?
Ahhhh!
Okay.
I know that.
Beautiful.
It shouldn't be a long delay.
Twelve hours, no big deal.  We should know something first thing in the morning.  Don't worry.
Fuck the suits, it's the people monitoring them.  It Doc had been there like he's supposed to it never would've happened!
Pretty good.  He sent them out videotaping outcrop.
It's Hazy...It's got him! Stay here and don't let him out.  I'm going to get the Doc.
This is what I wear at the beach, goddamnit.
I'm on the way to the looney bin?  Hey, man, I'm not the dude sun bathing in his clothes.
He's tanking on us...
'Fucker could have gotten us all killed.
Probably the plumbing.  You gonna make me finish that puzzle by myself, or what?
Two hundred meters.
We're simply concerned about her...proximity to...
I've got Cobbie downstairs watching the door.
I don't know.  I'm guessing.
"Debbie Does Dallas"...  Hell, it's in Russian.  I can't read it...
Sleeping.  No sign of Doc, though.  I'll check the control room.  You look in the shower room...
Oh man, that's just great...
The good doctor signed our death warrant.
The air's stopped.
Answer them and quit kicking me!
Right.
It's hit us all hard!
And nobody wants to live next door to the people that we live next to; a bit anti-social, you know.
A cocktail, you asked for a cocktail.
You ask him if you like, but I would leave him to it if I was you.
They were . . .
Yeah, Bazza, what?
No mortgage, no debts; lock, stock, the sodding lot . . . don't worry, I got it under control.
It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there.
Careful, remember who's giving you this job.
Very fucking funny. Where's what I want?
All right, Dad.
You know those shotguns I sold ya, well I need 'em back.
I got the money to pay for 'em.
All right, Kenny.
What is the point in that? Even if it was a bug they would have taken it with 'em.
What do you mean, never? Well what have they got it for, then?
There is no such thing as easy in my experience and, if you think this is going to be easy, you're a dick. It may be easier than most but it's not going to be easy.
OK, open the gate.
What the fuck is going on?
Get the sodding gate open now, Plank.
All right, all fucking right, I am coming.  Willie, he doesn't know you are here, just sort something out, OK.
There is only three of us here.
Invitations?
Well that depends on how you look at it. I can afford it as long as I see it again, if that's what you mean. You got the rest from the fat man and Bacon?
Hit the fuckers.
Carrying them. They could all be carrying them for what we know.
You think it's a good idea taking it back to yours?
I'll only be a minute.
A hundred grand.
You will what?
I like your bar.
All right, it's Plank. Is Willie there?
Well, perhaps you can help?
Look, could you just open the door so I could talk without shouting?
I think you'll find it is in your interest.
I know.  Now shut it. You say a fucking word the right knee goes, another word then your left.
You know how much it is, Nick.
I think you're Nick the Greek.
I got contacts. Listen Tom, if you pointed them at me I'd shit myself or do whatever you said to do. Either way you still get the desired effect.
Range? I don't want to blow the arse out of this country, granted, but I don't want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either. I want to look fucking mean.
So?
Get your fingers out of my soup!
Tom, the fatter you get, the sadder you get.
The problem is, Willy, that Charlie and yourself are not the quickest of cats in the alley at the best of times, so just do as I say and keep the fucking cage locked.
So?
Leave your sister out of it.
I can fix cars.
You think I can't learn that?
I said pretty much the same thing to my mother when I was your age.
I am, sir.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
I know that, Sergeant. We were just dancing. There was a bunch of us there. Shadow just come down looking for trouble.
Sergeant?
Skull was intact, no soft tissue left--not much to go on.
Yeah, it's a pretty cold trail.
--they hadn't pulled me off that woman I would have jerked a knot in her.
Least he never called me that. With me, it was always "high-strung." "My Bunny might have done something with her life, she wasn't so high-strung." Or "tightly wound," that was another one. You seeing anyone?
So that's him--
If it's too late--
They fought against the Indians?
These are our people. There were Paynes in Florida, Oklahoma, Piedras Negras--couple of 'em won the whatsit-- Congressional Medal Of Honor--
Dad, can I talk to you about track?
He does.
Cool.
I don't know why I'm talking to you, you've got that thing on your head.
It's not just cactus.  There's the nopals, the yuccas--
We had a kid pass out in the men's room. The town isn't much.
Priscilla says they think any woman over 30 who isn't married must be a lesbian. She figures they'll be so relieved I'm a man--
Her parents acted like I was gonna blow my nose on their curtains--
They were using M-1's, yeah--
Hey--she's in a tough situation. I cut her some slack--
Well--I don't see what's changed. No - PDA's, no necking on the obstacle course.
You know who it was they dug up?
This was a rifle range way back when. But we figured it isn't Army land anymore, it's your jurisdiction.
I hear things, too.  People call you the Mayor of Darktown.
Bandidos, Injuns--
No te molestas. Tenemos a ella. [Don't worry. We've got her.]
Good night, Enrique. She slides into the car--
We have a daughter.
He was a unique individual.
Just as well. The new people just painted it some God-awful color--
He owned the colored roadhouse before Big O--
No. I think his widow's still in their place in Darktown, though.  You think it's Charley Wade, huh?
We got that dedication tomorrow. This is a hell of a time to be draggin' up old business.
The Perdido thing?
Danny's gonna be out for blood the next time.
It wouldn't happen to be your construction company gonna get the bid on building this thing, would it, H.L. And Jorge, you wouldn't be thinking about a couple dozen new jobs to dangle in front of the voters--
I felt that you could do better for yourself--
I never said that. It was just that boy--
We run that twenty-odd years. Give it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April.
He's going to wish he was dead.
He ever accept cash for a favor?
It doesn't have anything to do with being smart.
Oh, my mother wanted to keep me away from away from boys.
Out in the fresh air, nice gringo lady making you pies--who's gonna sit back in a little jail cell all day? Sheriff Buddy, man. Como el no hay dos. And after that cabron Charley Wade--
He murdered Eladio Cruz. That tough enough for you?
Yeah.
You've got your mother, your kids--
Yeah.
Yeah.
Nothing.
I don't know. It just feels good. Always did.
Two years.
Don't have kids. Other pictures--I don't know--it's nothing I want to look back on.
She'll figure it out sooner or later. I don't have to ask permission anymore, if that's what you mean.
Nothin' much. The Rangers put Ben Wetzel on it. Catch you later.
I'm going over to the other side.
You'd do a good job.
Well, it's a complicated issue--
I haven't seen anybody come by.
Uh-huh.
I know that.
You going to tell him?
You believe that?
That would have kept you out of the Magic Circle.  Which was presumably the idea.  These are about Nix.
doorway) And who's that?
A Nix specialty?
Why would I do that?
What do you mean, "all of us?"
I could scoop them out.
I swear... this is the place Swann told me about.  The rocks...
What is he?
He's with us... He's with us...
Yes.
You don't?
I don't exactly know. Philip doesn't like to talk about the past.
No.  You're right.  He could have been something more. Maybe a lot more.  But people get lost.  Even good people. Too much fame.  Too much money,
Harry.
I'm no bodyguard.
I heard what happened.  It looks like somebody murdered him.
They won't tell you anything.
Yes... I'm here.  And no.  I don't know the name.
It doesn't ring a bell.  I have to go.
Some or it.
I told you --
I was grateful to him.  I owed him my life.  And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it.
I'm sure.  He's dead.
Quaid and Jennifer--
Find Valentin!  Find him!  Get him in here!
I... have... to.
I think so.
Harm to whom?  Me?  I don't think, so.  Try him again at the hotel.
Nix was never interested in you. It was always Swann.
Somebody killed him.
Sure.  You want me to find out about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral?
Tapert's got nothing to do with this.  He came here to get his palm read.
So could you walk on water?
I heard he was the best.
Oh, I've got plenty.
Evil.  He was evil.  Come on.
You could almost pass for a detective, D'Amour.  I work for the best illusionist in the world.
Looking for you.  I tried the hotel.
A ticket home,
Shut up!
Shut up.  We've lost enough lives already.
What?
Not much.
At birth.  I don't know you --
For what?
You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour.
Why?  So you can fuck my wife?
Illusionists get. Las Vegas contracts, D'Amour.  Magicians get burned.
I did it for Dorothea.
In my time, and nobody else's.
What?
No.
Why would I want to?
Ok, you're scheduled to leave Saturday, but we'll hold a seat Thursday in case, but first class is full, you're waitlisted for an upgrade... there might be a seat on Lufthansa...
Bob, it's me.
You'll do it?
You're probably just having a mid- life crisis. Did you buy a Porche?
Philosophy.
Thanks for getting me back in one piece.
Yeah, you don't remember?
We established that we have no communication.
I know, but that's what you like about me.
How old is she?
Fuck off.
I don't know, I think maybe I broke it? I knocked into something the other day...
Around.
Yes?
Hello, darling.
Oh, yeah? I wish I had seen it.
What?
Bye.
Why do you have to defend her?
What?
I'm not. It's just corny, but I'm not into it.
Ok, definitely call them, I'll be back Friday. I love you.
It'll just be a few days.
Charlotte?! How's Tokyo?
Sure.
It's probably trivial.
I must really be slacking off.  Hungry?
Hmmm.
Says she can get me in to see this killer.
No.  Of course not.  Mmmm.  Anago.  My favorite.
Forgot my car keys.  What are you doing on the fourth floor?
What happened?
I don't know.  In a way, I'm glad it all happened.
I found the pentacle.
You really had me going, Claire.  I was finally ready to propose to you.
What time did you make it for?
Quite a compliment coming from you, doctor.
You know I'm not comfortable with this.
I think I should join you.
I hope so.
You're right, but it's funny.  All my life I thought I was simply a man who didn't believe in any of it.
It was perfect.  The harder I pushed, the more you pulled away.
Father, I'm right here.
Well, in my prayers, I realized we've been fooling ourselves and probably... blown this all out of proportion.  God would never allow anything like that to happen.
Peter Kelson?
I saw you on television yesterday.  You were brilliant.
An exorcism was just held for Birdson. It failed.  Disastrously.  Which means there's still a demonic spirit present in his body.  I was wondering, perhaps you'd like to go meet Henry.  He's pretty amazing.
On television, you seemed so sure of yourself.  If you're really that confident, you'd be willing to let someone prove you wrong?
I had to.
It's true.  Birdson knew your name, he was writing it in numerical code.  It wasn't easy but I figured it out.  It spelled your name.
Seven years.  One baptism?  He's your mother's only brother
Townsend, he had some of Father's books.
The books themselves or maybe some pages he ripped out.
I'll go outside and take a look in the garage.
Sometimes, when I feel weak, I have these...visions.
I see things.  My worst fears.  You need to know something, Peter.  I was possessed once.  Like Birdson.  It took Father Lareaux six days to pull me out of it.
I know it is.  Right after my parents died, I went to the beach...  I was in the water.  Everything was calm.  And then one of those really big waves hit me.  Hard.  Pulled me straight to the bottom.  I struggled and finally ran out of air.  If it hadn't been for my sister who pulled me out, I would've drowned. Legally dead for a couple of minutes is what they told me.
Only your body will remain.  I believe your soul will be at peace.  If we kill you, Satan can't stay.
What are these?
Terrific.
Not a lot.
I'll explain everything later.  Can you meet me tonight?
Look, John, I'm facing it.
You are the younger of two...
Nothing you couldn't find out from reading the papers.  And you're already wrong on one count.
What about that psychic, what's his name, Szabo?
Lemme guess.  The lottery.
Thanks for having me, Sally.
Right.  If you believe in God.  As a narcissist, Viznick couldn't blame himself for the alleged murders.  He created the voices after the fact.  In order to avoid the simple truth that there is no outside force that guides George Viznick and that George Viznick needs to pay.
Really?  You know, seeing these guys away from the court, the facade slips. You catch things.
He's looking right at me.
Sure thing.  Look, I've got enough, between your preliminary statements and all the witness accounts.  You can go home.  Gimme til morning.  Find out who he is. Until then, don't sweat it, huh?  Just your random bad cheese trying to hole you.
Where is she now?
To that stewardess?
Don't tell me you aren't ashamed of that because I know.
It was the least we could do.  And I love to cook.
I want you to stand like that until you're sick of it because I don't ever want to see it again, you hear me?  Dora, take her spot.
Huh?
Kyra, this is Monica.  She, uh...
Why not?
Baby, don't talk like that.  Your rehab's going well.  You'll be back before you know it.
Don't make fun of me when I'm being wonderful and supportive.  You belong on the court.  Just like I belong in the stands, looking cute and cheering you on.
No.
Always on my ass, anyway.
Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker.
He's in college?
Yeah, right.
Yeah, once I cut them off.  Why?
Dad.  What are you doing here?
Didn't have to try very hard.
I know this.  What do you want?
And?  She's not saying, "I think you're a nice guy and I wanna get to know you better," she's saying, "I wanna bone."
Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything.
Who's Spalding?
I don't.
He ain't Spalding.
Cause I don't just stick my dick in anything.
It was on my bed when I came in.  Can you just...?
I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me.
Who cares if you're never known as the first girl in the NBA.  You'll get more play behind Quincy McCall's woman anyway.
You think for once we could talk about something besides basketball?
Look, this party's whack.  You ready to go?
Not really.
What, "Q-man", did I forget to kiss your ass like everybody else?
That night you wanted to talk about your Dad I had a curfew.  What was I supposed to do?
Not for Quincy McCall.
Kiss my ass.
Must have been my cheap-ass answering machine.  It was always messing up.
What do you mean?
No.
That a nice way of saying I rode the bench?
Seems like I needed a ball when I was trying to be like my pops...or trying to be better than him.  Now, I kinda think I need to try something else.
It's a trip, you know?  When you're a kid, you see the life you want, and it never crosses your mind that it's not gonna turn out that way.
What?
So, if I win it's because deep down you know you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life, and deep down your want me to stop you.
C'mon, girl, you live next door.  Who's been creeping?
At one in the morning?
No, you said I should get my degree.  I like my "bullshit" job, okay, and it's gonna lead to a spot in the front office. Til then, don't worry, there's just enough savings to keep your ass in Gucci and gold.
Nona, please.
Happy.  And he won't want to see you.
We still have to go?
I've been hearing you.
Said he'd be home later.
So you're gonna take the word of some trick over Pop's?  He wouldn't lie.
"Can't" should never be in a man's vocabulary.
Cause when you say can't, you ain't a man.
I don't care about the team.  I care about the school.
I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
You know, people.
I want this thing to go to court, but my lawyer's telling me to settle.
A case like this could hang around for months and I'm up for this player relations job with the "Clips."  This gets out, false or not, no one'll touch me.
Your door was unlocked.
I'm saying I handled my responsibilities like a man.  But when you're in the NBA, you pull into a city and there's a hundred women waiting at the hotel.  And another twenty that made it past security on your floor.  And the boldest one is standing right at your door.  And after awhile, it just becomes part of the game.  I'm sorry I lied to you, I shouldn't have.  But I did it cause I love you.
I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't let you do this.
You want me to fuck off?
Oral surgery.  Corrective teeth surgery.
ooohhhhhh no.
And the book says: "We may by through with the past, but the past ain't through with us."
You fuckin' don't do that. You don't do it, you cocksucker. I'll fuckin' kill you with my barehands.  Go. get the fuck fuck -- we're going back and we finish the show --
Ok. Janet you have Phil Parma --
Well what's the situation?
Does this sound weird?
There's no number for Frank in any of Earl's stuff and he's pretty out of it -- I mean, like I said, he's dying, y'know.  Dying of Cancer.
It's rough.  I'm sorry, did she make it?
It's a helluva disease.
It's me.  Claudia.  It's me.
I want to sit.  I want to talk to you.
Don't yell, honey.  Please don't go crazy --
YOU BURN IN BELL.  You burn in hell and you deserve it -- YOU GET THE FUCK OUT.
GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
No one else in there with you?
Ok. For one thing, we're gonna need to turn that music down so we can talk, ok?
Well if you keep listenin' to the music that loud you're not only gonna damage your ears but your neighbors ears.
You just move in here?
Yeah...it's not...it's been on for a bit --
Arlight, then.  Cheers.
-- is not my boyfriend.
It's not -- what's a 422?
It's not my boyfriend -- and it's not anything -- it's over.  Really. It's not.  He won't came back.
You won't.  You won't have to.
We were just gettin' warmed up. We were just getting started.
I'm sorry.
Good bye.
What is it?  Did you forget something?
Well...is that illegal?
I thought you were flirting with me a little.
Bye.
ok.
...yeah...
I didn't mean...it's seems vulgar or something, I know --
ok.
That felt good to do...to do what I wanted to do.
Oh my god, Jim. Jim, that was so --
You don't how fuckin' stupid I am.
I've got troubles.
Wanna kiss me, Jim?
Yes.
Ready to go,go,go?
How much time do we have?
Stay quiet...stay quiet, son --
Son, don't --
Put the gun down, please, boy.
He's doing the interview with the lady --
What happend?
Fine.  Phil, you still there?
Maybe I'm just happy to see my friend, Brad there.
This sounds threatening.
And I'm listening avidly, fellow.
I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
Yes they do, they do, but I'll make my dreams come true, you see?  I will.
"Why don't you shut the fuck up," is me to you, Chapter Right Here, Verse Right Now.
Gently, son --
Two years! Two years later and out of your paycheck, I never charge interest --
Yes.
It's...doesn't matter....
Do you wanna sit down?
Fuckin' bullshit is what this is.
There's no asshole like you.
How come every word you say is either "cocksucker," or "shitballs," or "fuck?"
Who are you gonna call?
Alright.  Thank you.
You got us a room so quick?
-- go, go, go.  I'm givin' pearls here. And I'II tell you samethin' else: I'm not succeding in the bush because I'm Frank TJ Mackey.  If anything, there are women out there that want to <u>destroy</u> me -- it makes it twice as hard for me, I run into some little muffin, knows who I am, knows my schemes and plans -- shit, she's gonna wanna fuck around, prove to her friends, say, "Yaddda-yadda-yadda, I saw that guy, he wasn't anything, didn't get me."  So me? I'm runnin' on full throttle the whole fuckin' time.  Dodging bullets left and right from terrorist blonde beauties. But I'II tell you this: The battle of the bush is being fought and won by Team Mackey.  Can I have a cigarette?
Like I said, yeah --
It's fine.  I can bleep it out.
Not really.
I'm not sure I hear a question in there?
Go ahead and waste your time.
What am I doing?
I'm quietly judging you.
Around here.
Hollywood, mainly.
Right.
Oh, yeah.  No, no, no.  They wouldn't --
I wouldn't want that to be misunderstood: My enrollment was totally unoffical because I was, sadly, unable to afford tuition up there.  But there were three wonderful men who were kind enough to let me sit in on their classes, and they're names are: Macready, Horn and Langtree among others. I was completely independent financially, and like I said: One Sad Sack A Shit. So what we're looking at here is a true rags to riches story and I think that's what most people respond to in "Seduce," And At The End Of The Day? Hey -- it may not even be about picking up chicks and sticking your cock in it -- it's about finding What You Can Be In This World.  Defining It.  Controling It and saying: I will take what is mine.  You just happen to get a blow job out of it, then hey-what-the-fuck- why-not?  he.he.he.
He's...I'm sorry...so sorry...I've seen this before, you know and you don't.... He's going very fast....Frank...um....
I'm really sorry.
Then you've got nothin' to worry about.
No one else in here?
OK.  That's true.  Is anyone else, besides me and besides you in this house?
What's this, how did this happen?
It's a free country, you can think anything you want.
I don't have to do a god damn thing.
THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE. STAY OUT OF MY MOTHERFUCKIN BEDROOM.
What the fuck is this, Jimmy?
You're making me feel so dirty and shitty. I feel like a big piece of shit right now.
If she asks me any question I want to tell her.  I want to tell her everything I've done.
Fifteen minutes ago, where were those cards?
I need you to get me Paula --
We just do it...we do it and we figure it out and we do as we do, I guess...
I'm a bad person.
I don't even remember...many...twenty... maybe more...not much more...twenty times.
How long with Ellen?
Well maybe.
Why, well I think we've, we both don't know...what do you mean?
Did you ever touch her?
...I don't know...
Stay here, please don't leave me, please, please, if I said I knew would you stay?
Hello.  Is Claudia here?
I'll get it because I'm a good actress, Richard.
No...I just... I'm so fucked up here Alan, I don't know...there's so much...so many things --
If I talk to you...y'know...if I tell you things...then you're a lawyer, right? You can't say things, you can't tell anyone, it's like the privelage, right? Attornery-client, you understand?
Linda, you just have to take a moment and breath and one thing at a time --
I'm trying to help, Linda --
Hang up the phone.
mmmhmm.
Hi. I'd like to get an order for delivery.
Yeah.
Do you have that?
Yes. What? Yes.
Thank you.
We need more dog food --
I need this one.
Love you too.
See you.
Stand up.
Go to bed.
It's frogs.  It's raining frogs.
It's raining frogs from the sky.
This happens....this is something that happens.
M'lady...?
D'Artagnan.
We haven't visited in three years. And we should have privacy.
First they told me he had died at birth.  Then your father admitted he was alive, but well cared for, in secret.  But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner.
Replace the king.
Making the key to the throne.
Excellent, Athos.  You have a keen sense of this man.
Tomorrow.
There is that, of course -- but mainly it is because I am so much smarter than everyone else.
I have it all worked out.
Those can be adopted --
Do you think I have not considered that?  I have a plan -- and you may rest assured that it is brilliant!
You grow fond of him.  That's good.
But -- what is he doing?
Louis is planning a visit to the Vatican, then who knows where after that.  If we miss him now we may not get another chance.
Hold your goblet with two fingers.
Be quiet, you fat fool.  Can't you see I'm praying?
So they tell us.  But what are we to believe when the king is a tyrant, and the Church, meant to stand for all those oppressed, has become the tool of oppression?  When no conscience is tolerated?  No dissent, no objection?
I will answer all your questions. But first soap, water, and a razor.
I carried the king's child!  The queen had twins that night, and one of them was sent away, in secret!
Who?
At a ball, everyone watches the King!
It's a prison, you idiot!  They don't expect anyone to try getting in!  The problem will come when we want out!
She cannot possibly refuse.  Her family is poor, they have even less money than we do.  And along with the invitation, the King sent the diamond pendant, from the piglet.
I have rejoined the army, and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of General Fromberge.
It is already done.  I have just stopped at Mother's grave, to say goodbye, before coming to tell you.
Athos, my friend!
Midnight!  Mon dieu!  Driving the youngsters hard, eh?
Who came?
And you never knew why?
I decided it this morning.
I am King, d'Artagnan.  I will change my mind as I wish, and I will enjoy my banquet as I wish!
Mademoiselle Michelle Beaufort.  She is betrothed to Raoul, the son of Athos the Musketeer, who has served France through many tribulations.
In his mind, anyway, and soon enough in hers.  She had written him many letters of love.
Your Majesty has had many women --
Not criticize -- plead.  Love.  Love your people, and you will not bear to see them hungry.  Love women, and they will love you.  Love yourself, and --
At least help Raoul.
... tired.  Must... lie down.
Forgive?!
What was the end page?
Yes, yes, go on.
No.  He cut an ear from one of the men, no one else was hurt.  Captain d'Artagnan allowed him to leave. Athos was upset about the death of his son, at the front.
Aramis!  I have been expecting you!  We are satisfied, that will do.
What... an excellent idea, your Majesty!
Oh Louis, Louis...
Cooperate?
Sarah Williams left the bar with Trudell on her own.
Right behind you.
Did you start out area six?
That's got to our secret agent man! Do we have an address?
I'll live...
Did he harm the girl?
Mm-hmm...that's not what the bartender told us.
And what did he do to the girl?
Could explain why Fleming was there.
I lost him - I heard shots - that way!!
Yeah?
Up north.
Figure you would have tried it already.
No.
You'll find out - soon enough.
No.  A witness.
Yeah...they did.  One girl...
Tubbs listen!  I don't know anywhere else to go!  I need your help!
Please...
Hello Tubbs.  Can I come in?
OK...where do you want to start?
A bank?
Both at the same bank...
I'm not going anywhere!
I don't have any real destination. I'm just going South.
County jail - get in.
You're never alone in a room with Graham, are you? You're smooth about it, but you're never one-on-one with him. Why's that? Do you think he's psychic?
If the Tooth Fairy listens to Lecktor, he'll come for me. So we're going to set me up as bait to draw him out. Give him a clean shot.  That's what you were thinking, isn't it?
That's probably in the part Lecktor tore out.  At the top it says: 'I hope we can correspond.' And then the hole begins.  It looks like Lecktor went over it with a felt tip pen and then folded it and pinched most of it away.
Twenty minutes max.
That could be the tip of a 't.  Here and here. And here.
When do they go to press?
Issue the toilet paper tear as a...
Not the Bible?
Library of Congress.
Will Graham, Jack Crawford...
I have to.
Because it's his bad luck to be special.
What was in the 'Miami Herald' and the 'Times.'  Confessions?
Somebody hurt him?
You don't need me. I wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack.
I am all right.
He's working on the single print index. What time is it?
What is it?
...there's three 't's' and an 'r' in Tattler.
Yes. And I'm leery of running Lecktor's message without knowing what it says.
Will, Bowman just broke the code. It was a James Beard cook book. You need to know what it says right now.
No.
That's narrow?
There's no connection between the families.
Let's admit we struck out this month. The Gulf Stream's standing by. The basic lab stuff is on it.  You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, a photographer. Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and fifteen minutes. We get the call, we roll. The scene'll be very fresh...
Have him peel the top label back.
I want a chopper on the roof in three minutes. To Meigs Field.  At Meigs have them warn up and flight- prep the Gulf Stream.
This is our boy...!
Stay in the trees.
He went to the men's room.
Tonic will be fine.
I made you a gin and tonic. It's by the side of the sofa...
Yes, are you okay...?!
I want to see you, too, Francis... Should I come over?
You'll come by?
It's me.
Some remarkable events have happened in Birmingham and Atlanta.  Do you know what I'm talking about?
Francis did a thing for you today so I couldn't have you. And he was wrong.  I AM THE DRAGON!  Give me your hand.
My back hurts, my skin. Did I get burned? I hope to God I'm not burned.
Atoning, Mr. Lounds.
Yes.
No. I don't want to see you.
Yes...
Yes.
Please, no.
Yes.
'I have had a great privilege. I have seen with wonder the strength of the Red Dragon. All I wrote about him before was lies from Will Graham. He made me write them. Now I understand.  'Will Graham: you will learn from my own lips how much you have to dread. Because I was forced to lie, he will be more merciful to me than to you.  'I will be a testament to the truth, now.  About his work. About his becoming.'
Absolutely,
Dr. Chilton.
Yeah. It's right here.
Uh... sure...
Well, it's about goddamn time!  I have a note here, or two pieces of a note, that appears to be from the man who killed those people in Atlanta and....
It's written on toilet tissue.  'My dear Dr. Lecktor, I wanted to tell you I'm delighted that you've taken an interest in me. I know that you alone can understand what I'm becoming.  'I know you alone understand the reality of the people who die to help me in these things, understand that they are only elements undergoing change to fuel the radiance of what I am becoming.  Just as the source of light is burning.  Mr. Graham, there's a hole torn and punched out, then it says...  'I have a complete collection of your press notices.  I think of them as unfair. As unfair as mine. The "Tooth Fairy." What could be more inappropriate.  Investigator Graham interests me.  Very purposeful looking. I hope we can correspond.  There's another piece missing here. I'll read the bottom part.  'After I hear back from you, I might send you something wet.  Signed: Avid Fan.  It has teethmarks pressed in it at the bottom.
Most people are.
That's true.
Describe exactly what you think he did to Mrs. Leeds and I'll tell you if you're right or not.
What's average?
Nine that we know of. Two didn't die.
We have it good, don't we?
What you've already decided. You're not really asking.
Mmmmh... I love you, too, Will. Good night.
I remember.
I want to see you, too.
No.
I got it. Thank you.
It's in the transcript. What does it matter now?
I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.
I thought you would have some ideas.
I thought you might be curious to find our if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for.
You're insane.
Yes.
No.
I refuse.
Of course!  That's what negotiations are for.
Hi George!
I don't know!  Andy... you need to look inside: Who are you trying to entertain?  The audience... or yourself?
But wasn't it funny?
But I feel you're extending this philosophy to real life.  It's obsessive.  Nothing's ever on the level anymore.
No, I'm not gonna take it.  If I take it I'll break my back.
WRONG!  You haven't given them any clues that it's a parody!
You've got good days and bad days.
Eh, I dunno... Andy.  I'm... thinkin' of letting you go...
You know that's not what I meant! Look, I'm gonna put my foot down! No more playing alone.  You wanna perform, you GOTTA have an audience!
Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing.  It didn't hurt at all.  It was just a yoga move.  I tucked my head in.
But it's only for thirty seconds!
Okay, great!  So let's reset!
Buzz off.  Go patronize somebody else.
Oh.  So you were just pretending to be an asshole.
Hi... am I late?
No!  YOU get in the kitchen.  I'm gonna make you dry my dishes!
I can shtop whenever I want...
I-I'm sorry.  I got caught up in the action...!
Even if I'm dying -- I still need clean socks.
Okay.  You're probably right.
Don't worry!  The kids will love it --
Then your father's a wimp.
Then your father's a wimp.
Are you nuts?!  40 million people watch you every week!
Absolutely nothing!  That's the beauty!  It's credibility.  You make them love you... and then later, on your special, you'll screw with their heads!
No!  Andy, don't do it --
No offense, pal, but I just don't think you're built for it.  These he- men'll kick your ass!!  They're huge!
Yeah, my problem is you're tired.
Why??  I... I attend every year.
It is apparently not working.
I'll take my chances!!
Sure it is.  Tony called me himself. He yelled at me, insisting that his dressing room be bigger than Andy's. They're both going on tonight, believe me!
I don't know what yer talkin' about. You musta talked to someone else --
Yeah!  You stay away from that Andy Kaufman, if you know what's good for you!
FORGET IT.  It's in terrible taste! I want nothing to do with this.
Yeah.  They don't know whether to be sad, or angry.
Of course he's in his room.  All his "friends" are in there.
We have no choice but to continue as planned.  Deploy the sentinels. Immediately.
Hurry!
And you are?
You all look the same to me.
No way.  Not possible.
Should Tank I.D. it?
Oh, God.
If you get caught using that --
How many were there?
I got you.
Shit!  Apoc?
Hello, Neo.  Do you know who this is?
Stand up and see for yourself.
What truth?
For what?
Because... I didn't think I would?
How?
Yes.  She's very old.  She's been with us since the beginning.
She is a true psychic.  She sees beyond the relativity of time.  For her there is no past, present or future.  There is only what is.
Don't think of it in terms of right and wrong.  She is a guide, Neo. She can help you find the path.
Yes.
Why?
What do you believe in?
No.  I did not.  I have never told anyone this, Neo.  After I saw the Oracle I thought... no, I misunderstood what she told me.  I believed that it was all about me. That I would find the One, not that he would find me.
Goddamn!  It's good to hear your voice, sir!
He is the One.  He is the One!
I'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway.  And don't worry about the vase.
Shit, I'm sorry.
Honestly?  I don't know.
From you.
Why?
... shit.
... right as rain.
A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it.
A deju vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix.  It happens when they change something.
I don't know.  It just went dead.
No?  Let me tell you what I believe. I believe Morpheus means more to me than he does to you.  I believe that if you are serious about saving him then you are going to need my help and since I am the ranking officer on this ship, if you don't like it then I believe that you can go to hell, because you aren't going anywhere else.
If this war ended tomorrow, Zion is where the party would be.
Hey, Mikey, he likes it!  Ready for more?
Neo, this has to be done!
What are you talking about?
I know that's what it looks like, but it's not.  I can't logically explain to you why it's not. Morpheus believed something and he was ready to give his life for what he believed.  I understand that now. That's why I have to go.
You're going to kill him?  Kill Morpheus?!
What the hell just happened?
Hey!  You want good stuff, or you want shit?
Well, maybe they do that in Riverdale, but down here we take cash.  Now, you got it or not?
Well, my stuff comes from Maryland... you know what that means?
Don't go to any trouble.  We believe you... We believe you.
'Dost thou say this of thyself, or have others told thee of me?'
Hide the gun.  Throw it away. Anything.  Listen, I gotta borrow your car...I think we should take a ride...away from here for the night...you know what I mean?
And say what?
Not quite...but keep trying.
Should I slap him?
I don't like loading crates.
Listen...I'm a guest here.
I could have told you that.
Did you see them run!
I understand.
Don't be smart.
Mind your own business.
He'd rather have the loan payed, you know that.
I don't understand, where's Groppi?
Sell 'em if you can't smoke them.
You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
I'd like to know Charlie, it looks like your little friend is trying to duck me...
You're right.  You're right.  Look, I'm not gonna wind up paying his debts.  You know that.
He'll be here.  Look, take this for now.
'But I say to you, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute...'
You're not going to use that gun, Johnny.
Fine.
I know.
Fine.  Did you have a good time last night?
No...his business is bad.  But I'll decide what to do and you...and you just keep out of anything that might...might...er draw attention to you.
Oh...around...why?
Oh yeah, that's a possibility.
No, c'mon...Y'know, I read.
What is it now?
Now don't get excited.  Don't get excited!!
This is some boat.  Your father's?
No...no.  Nooo...it's just that I...I...uh... this ain't my car.
You what?
Friends of yours Michael.
Yeah, Bill, the suspense is killing me.
Love that name.
He's cute.
No.
And you could care less --
We've got some things to discuss.
It's starting to grow on me.  But what do the 'B' and 'P' mean?
But that's what you were thinking. And that's okay.  Because I know you love me.  Not like it is with Susan, the way your eyes light up when she comes in the room and the way she always gets a laugh out of you, as opposed to me when I walk in a room and that look comes over your face, "What does she want now?"
He said he would be there with bells on.
No jocks?  A twenty-game winner or a Masters champion?  Someone I could talk to.  Or would talk to me.
-- The late harvest Riesling, Mr. Quince, a possibility for dessert.
I thought you were buying my company.
You mean this, sir?
How would you like that, sir?  On some kind of toast?
Here...
Cold.
Like a marriage made in heaven?
I am now.
But the matter's still on the table, Bill --
Before I do --  I was hoping we might be alone, Bill.
For how long?  And why?
Please, Drew.
I'm just giving you the truth.  There was a time when William Parrish liked the truth.
I don't think so.  Do you?
Proof?  We've got plenty of proof.
Go right ahead.  Tell William Parrish how you betrayed him at a secret Board meeting.  And tell Allison how you got her father fired -- and he lost his company.
I from dat nex' place.
None facety, mistah.  You come for me?  Dat's good news.
Doctor?  What could be wrong wit' you?
Rass!
Of course, Mr. Parrish.  Right away.
What?
Yes?
As long as it takes.
Hey, this is fun.
I didn't know that.
Because that's the kind of man Bill Parrish is.
No.
Peanut butter.
I haven't.
Do you love Drew?
I don't have any.
I have a certain function to per- form, and that seems to take all of my time.  Bu sometimes - uh - I speculate - uh - I haven't left room for - uh - anything else.
How nice you look.  Is that your uniform?
Then why are you here, Joe?
I am, too.
Because guys who never say anything about themselves are always married.
To bed.
It was everything.
Never tried, 'til now.  Joe, may I kiss you?
I don't know who you are.
And is your heart beating strangely?
He must be tired -- this Bontecou thing --
Maybe it's the draft through the door.
Yes!
And you can't tell me who you are.
Then don't.
We know all that we need to know --
Don't.  That will come later.
And I said you'd have a hard time finding a woman like that.
-- That was the place... and you were the guy.
I love you now, I'll love you always --
-- Yes?
Yeah...and you're the prettier thing here.
That's the best I can do.  ...but minute-by-minute, I find myself lingering.
'Feeling'?  I feel fine.  How do you feel?
It is a deal?
That's what everybody says.
Can you keep a secret?
So can I.
I'm sure you'll see to it that it won't be a problem.
I don't understand.
Oh.  Okay.
No thank you, Bill.  I can manage.
I guess...
'Fish'?
I'm sorry to hear that.
Well, you're at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman.
Yes, and stop repeating everything I say, and turning it into a question. Spooning, fooling around, God knows what.  You arrive on the scene -- why you picked me, I still don't under- stand --
I don't like your tone, and I don't like your references.
May I remind you this is not just a dispute with a putative suitor, this is me.  So watch it...Bill.
What are you saying, that it's time to go?
I was just asking, Bill.
I think you heard me, Bill.
Well, they're mine now.
With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you tell her who you are?
And we're very grateful.
Undisclosed conflict of interest --
I guess you have your reasons.
You're not Death.  You're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants.
Of course.
What?
There's going to be plenty of time for that.
Quiet.
Watch it!
Yes, Bill.  The question.
I'm doing great.  You ready?
Thank you, Quince.
Next week?
Yes, I believe I do.
But we want you back, Bill.  Mean- while, enjoy your party, celebrate, we'll attend to the nasty details. And Mr. Black, may we say thank you.
...Then don't.
You mean like you loved Mom?
Probably.
That's all?
I'm sorry.  But give it to me again. The short version.
You won't tell him, and even if you did, he'd clock it and punch it into his laptop in order to pull out some key phrases when he gives the Commencement Speech at Wharton.
Well, remember how you told me about "lightning striking"?  The nature of it's in there somewhere.
I'm having a helluva time.
Yes, but --
I want you to know how much I love you.  That you've given a meaning to my life that I had no right to expect, and that no one can ever take from me.
'Pro bono'.  That means doing good -- Going to be doing good all your life?
Why not?
It's not your fault. See, you have this condition...
I know about your fucking condition, Leonard! I probably know more about it than you do! You don't have a fucking clue about anything else!
I think I may have. I'm not good on the phone.
Then why is this my handwriting?
No. But the photo on his license looked familiar. I think he's been in the bar before
I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help.
Yes.
Did you?
There are things you know for sure.
What happened is that Jimmy went to meet a guy called Teddy. He took a lot of money with him and he didn't come back. Jimmy's partners think I set him up. I don't know whether you know this Teddy or how well -
Don't protect him.
Get rid of Dodd for me.
What then? Love? What would you kill for? For your wife, right?
That's easy for you to say! You can't get scared, you don't remember how, you fucking idiot!
You pathetic piece of shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard.
Can I ask you something?
Thank you.
What are you here for?
You have no idea where you've just come from? What you've just done?
So why did you come here?
Then why are you here?
I enjoy it.
I don't remember.
Mr Gammell?
So I see. It's good to see you. My name's Teddy.
The guy you're looking for, Johnny G. That's why you haven't left. Am I right?
Well, the other day you made it sound like you thought somebody might be trying to set you up. Get you to kill the wrong guy.
Probably left it in your room.
You called me. You wanted my help. You know, Lenny, I've had more rewarding friendships than this one. Although I do get to keep using the same jokes.
Think so? You don't know? Didn't you write it down?
I'm gonna ask Natalie what the fuck that was all about.
Teddy. Your buddy.
Lenny, as a buddy, let me inform you. Your business here is very much finished. You're still here because of Natalie.
She's involved with these drug dealers.
How long do you think you can hang around here before people start asking questions?
The sort of questions you should be asking yourself.
Like how'd you get this car? That suit?
So in your grief you wandered into a Jaguar dealership?
That's who you were, Lenny. You don't know who you are, who you've become since the incident. You're wandering around, playing detective... and you don't even know how long ago it was.
'Cos he fucking told me. He thinks it's funny. He's laughing at you.
There's a guy in here, hurt bad! We gotta get him to a doctor!
You tell everyone about Sammy. Everyone who'll listen. "Remember Sammy Jankis, remember Sammy Jankis". Great story. Gets better every time you tell it. So you lie to yourself to be happy. Nothing wrong with that - we all do. Who cares if there's a few little things you'd rather not remember?
When it's done, I'll know! It'll be different!
No. You took them out.						  *
Doing...?
Trudy and I are goin' for Gina...
Safe house is empty...  Air Support's set to jump when we know your drop point.  Gina?
I mean <u>full</u> disclosure.
Right now.
Havana.
Are you afraid?  Good.  And you don't need a visa. Cause you're with me.
Okay.  Macon, Georgia is where I was born. Wound up in a juvenile facility.  I was 14.  Then the military.  Then prison.  Because I was dumb and angry.  Then I read.  Then I got smart.  Then I discovered what I know, now...it's all business...
Zero risk.
And the chopsticks and fortune cookies?
Why?
When?
A few more moments, still in this business.  Then I'd find you.
No.
Sonny Burnett...this is my partner, Rico.
Who you run loads for?  Cause other than Nicholas, you knows you?
"Extras" tried to relieve us of your weight...  And by the by, you know of a player in Overtown who goes by the name of "Things Aquatic"?
Hey, Captain Kirk.  I think maybe I have second thoughts.
Mrs. Rico.  But don't worry.  She is safe.  To insure that, I am keeping her close to me.  It's always good to keep people your friends care about close to you.
Transpo?  How they bringing the loads in...?
We could try to run loads into these guys.  Run a few loads for Montoya into South Florida.  Into this group.
What kind of weight?
Gina in the Miami pad.  You gonna give me phony denials?
And we can illuminate part of it from the inside out.
What's the point?  It's going down.
Okay.  What's up?
"Buy and walk"?  "Buy and bust"? "Reverse undercover"?  What?
Who's the "we"?  There's you and there's us.  And all we got from you was bad intel.  "Low-level producer."  Yeah, right...
How will it stand up?
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Sonny...
...look after her.  Ask Rico to. Okay?  Do that for me.  I had to do it.  They had me from the gate. Do that.  Whatever you can do for them.  Okay?  Look what I did to them, Sonny...!
...what else, what else did he indicate to you?  I need to know everything he said.
We think NLR.  We don't know! Alonzo only fronted as a broker for our guys to make the meet.  He wasn't deep into the crew.
Yeah.
Yes.  What's up?
Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah?
But what does your intuition tell you...?
A good deal, like this with us, for Burnett will be good only temporarily.  He'll get restless because he believes nothing is forever.  Life is dust, make it while you can.  He's ambitious.
Define small.
Maritime.  Jose will fill you in.
I had to lay eyes on you.
You don't like us finding your load?  We can go and lose it all over again...
Alonzo, you don't need to go home.
It's up in Central Park, taking a leak. If you hurry, you'll make the supper show. Now get lost.
Lotta rich women back there...
Men, they mostly faggots.
Well, ain't no use hanging around here.
I got me two hundred twenty-four bucks of flat folding money...  He know what he can do with that chicken-shit day's pay. And if he ain't man enough to do it for himself, I be happy to oblige!
Gay ends in Y. Fey. You like that -- gay fey -- is that your problem?
Oh, it ain't cheap. I mean, yeah, I'd say this was an all right shirt. Don't like to, uh, you know, have a lot of cheap stuff on my back.
For money for what?
How would I know? You gotta tell a person these things  A hustler? Picking up trade on the street like that -- baby, believe me -- you need management.
My friend O'Daniel. That's who you need. Operates the biggest stable in town. In the whole goddam metropolitan area. A stud like you - paying! -- not that I blame you -- a dame starts crying, I cut my heart for her...
Okay, right, right, okay. Another subject. Where you living? Still at the hotel?
So you could sleep! I mean Christ!
Well now, Ratso, I'm gonna tell you something for your own good, only first gimme a cigarette.
I ain't forcing you, like, I mean, who's forcing you?
What's all this sweet talk about Florida? Your friend O'Daniel got a stable down there now?
Rico. Rico Rizzo.
Twenty bucks...
Yeah.
What of?
Who?
No doctors. No, sir. Not me. Doctors are like goddam auto mechanics. Fix one-thing, unplug another. Operate for piles and while they're there, they unscrew your liver. My old man, for God's sake, wasn't any sicker'n I am when he went to the doctor.
I'm going to Florida, that's my only chance.
I'll find the money. If you just get me on the bus, that's all I ask.
They gotta be.
I been thinking. I hope we're not gonna have a lotta trouble about my name down there. Because like what's the whole point of this trip anyway?
I mean New York's one thing, but can you see this guy, imagine it, running around the goddam beach all suntan and he's going in swimming, like, and then somebody yells 'Hey, Ratso' -- how does that sound to you?
Here I am going to Florida and my leg hurts, my butt hurts, my chest hurts, my face hurts, and like that ain't enough, I gotta pee all over myself.
Shee-it, you know, I got this thing all figured out, Ratso. I mean Rico. When we get to Miami, what I'll do, I'll go to work. I gotta do that, 'cause see, I ain't no kind of a hustler. I ain't even any goddam good as a bum. I'm a nothing, that's what I am. So reckon I'd better go to work and get me a goddam job. Okay?
What?
Oh, difficult, it's so difficult. You're a nice person, Joe -- I should never have asked you up -- a lovely person. Oh, how I loathe life. I loathe it. Please go. Please.
Oh. Yes. Of course. I should have thought. You shouldn't have to ask. That was thoughtless of me. Yes. Wait here...
Ready for anything.
Little fuckers are thieves, rapists, pickpockets, murderers, you name it - they do it. Don't trust any of 'em...
Twenty fucking YEARS, man - YEARS! I figger ten at the least.
It's already built!  There's a basement substructure where they used to keep weapons and stuff, but beneath that there's these old catacombs that the Christians built 'bout a thousand fucking years ago to bury their dead.  We're sitting right on top of it -- here.
We go through the wall?
Nah, just covered with batshit!
Ziat!
Same. None of the neighbors know. We told them you were in a hospital in Europe.  Oh... this is Stanley Davis. He's the American Consul here... And Necdit Yesil, the lawyer you wanted...
Sixty?
Would you recognize him again?
But didn't have heroin.
Something like that. Cigarette?
About as good as it looks.
Hashish.  Ninety percent of the foreigners are in for hashish.
That doesn't seem so bad.
He wasn't even in the car?
What do you mean?
What?  You gotta be joking.
Yeah? Where?
I make special tea for you, Hiyes, okay?  We've to live like brothers. We have to be in here together.
Mr. Yesil.
Yeah... there's no straight lawyers in Turkey... They're all bent bent as hairpins...
Selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates...
You wanna keep up the conversation, you best come back with the proper permits and the right attitude.
20 minutes. If you don't go sight-seeing anymore.
Well...there's an old service elevator half a mile down the tracks.  Ain't gonna be much use, though.  Lines are dead.
He can imitate anything, you just watch him.
But it look like a man. It... I saw it.
Manny...
We're down to a "couple" now, huh?
Monks bottle their own wine. Don't they?
I needed to think. It was either this or the weather channel.
Susan, we're not b-
No.
That's camouflage...
Try not to sweat?
Ah...
Peter...
You the bug lady, right?
That's it?
Just like Trump Tower, then.
Oh, right... They been here since noon. I told them you're real busy.
No shit.
Sure.
I could give you a couple of hundred pages of mine, and you could tell me what you think.
If you wouldn't mind.
It's crazy, but I don't really know, I mean I haven't written anything but "Misery" for so long that--you read it you can tell me what you think it's about. Maybe you can come up with a title.
It has no nobility.
It's fine.
The phones are working?
Well, you can't believe everything you read in magazines.
My pleasure.
Misery?
I know how that can be.
If I knew this was gonna be the surprise, you could've gotten me to burn all my books.
You just expect me to whip something off, that it?
Don't worry about that. You'll have total solitude so you can concentrate on your work.
No, just the paper will be fine.
I want my pills NOW!
You better. Oh, Paul, when Ian realized that the reason they'd buried Misery alive was because the bee sting had put her in that temporary coma--
Yeah, yeah...
To Misery.
The rain... sometimes it gives me the blues.
Why would I want to leave? I like it here.
It is.
Why would I run away? I'm a writer, Annie--it's all I am--and I've never written this well--even you said that this is my best, didn't you?
Maybe. Are you ready for the next chapter?
It will.
Dome Pear-igg-non it is.
Well, this deputy would rather be home under the covers with the Sheriff.
What? What is it?
Hope not--if he is, he's dead. Let's go to the newspaper office.
Just from his agent.
What?
That's nice.
It's good you found it.
He's your client, huh?
If I can.
Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff.  --Lest you call paper odd.
It's... it's nice, Paul. It's got... character.
No, no. Misery Chastain put braces on your daughter's teeth and is putting her through college, bought you two houses and floor seats to the Knick games and what thanks does she get? You go and kill her.
Great.
I'm delighted the critics are liking it, and I hope the people like it, too. But it's not why I wrote the book.
Now you've hurt me, Paul.
All done, chief..
Hugh, take care of the Nekhorvich memory card.
Hugh, I'm impressed..
I left in a bit of a hurry.  I'm terribly grateful, Sean.
Oh, I am.  Later..
Yeah.  Naturally vain -- but they're about to close the betting table and I haven't a sou..
Then don't say it.
Yes.  We won't be able to have dinner tonight.  Something's come up.  I hope you don't mind.
Ulrich will be about.  He'll look after you.
In downtown Sydney for a start.
Sit down.  You'll be a billionaire.  Better than being broke.  I've got terrorists and other pharmaceutical companies standing in line.  Ball's in your court, Mr. McCloy.
Billy, make sure Nyah's not followed.
Not going in from the ground.  Show me the atrium.
What manic invents  disease like that in the first place?  Why would he do it?
There guys are walking around with different halves of the same dollar bill?
Exactly where is she?
I hope there's a place to land.
I am. She is.
Hope he kills all the bugs before the yellow dot gets to the red one.
No.  Just as if I'd like to.
Oh, either way works for me.
Do what?
Working under adverse conditions.  Highly adverse conditions.
Listen to what?
Not revealing information doesn't necessarily make someone a liar.
Of what?
This wasn't what I had in mind, Nyah.
Can you think of a better one?
This doesn't seem to be accomplishing much.
How can you possibly?  I've got to get right on the plane.  I'm leaving now.
Ethan, you take care of yourself, I'll take care of myself because if push comes to shove, I'm gonna bail - and without giving two week notice.
Annex is strictly off limits to me and they never come to the main house, Michael even takes their meals to them all but shoves them under the door.
Why?  What's happened. What did you see?
How do you suggest I go about it?
I am now.  Get me out of here.  Just get me out of here.
Twice.
- is where Miss Hall comes in.
She sacrificed herself..
You'd like me to conduct my own debriefing.
Yes.
Well, Hunt, what are your plans?
Well, yes.  I suppose I am a bit anxious.
No.  After you've lived with <i>Chimera</i> for twenty hours, nothing can save you.  Not even...<i>Bellerophon.</i>
I'm fine..
Left jacket pocket?
You've got the voice print, I'll get us in..
All storage and production of Chimera is done here, in this lab on the forty-second floor, the heart of the building.
It was in the bloody papers, on the telly..what's this about Gradski?
'If?'  My, my, my...the five hundred people on Bruny Island that you deliberately infected with <i>Chimera</i> needed it as well.
Same thing he wanted in Prague!  Same thing he's always wanted!  The NOC list!
Heís putting on a show, Barnes.
Always.
Krieger.
What happened to Jim?
Take off your coat.
We did what we had to do.
Is this the only way?
This stuff is so sticky.
Itís all right, Ethan..youíll bring me back...wonít you...
You mean <u>I've</u> lost enough agents for one night.
Why was there another team?
Certainly Ethan.
I don't know, Ethan. Suppose you tell me?
There was never any physical evidence that I had anything to do with that.. that..  With that exceptional piece of work.
I'll get you close.
Well my Mother was a little confused about how the DEA could mistake her and Uncle Donald for a couple of dope smugglers in the Florida keys.
Hey, I'm the flavour of the month!
I need one hundred thousand dollars.
I'm NOC.  Was.  <u>Now</u> disavowed.
Because I can deliver the actual NOC list.  The one you have is not only worthless, it's certain to be equipped with a homing device to pinpoint your exact location.
How will you make sure I'll have the list in three days?  It's been a delight.  Now where can I drop you dear boy?
Bank?
We'll see.
Just waiting for you, tubs.
Higher.
What about my coat?  I'll freeze.
Jim we canít.
Very well.
Ah, God, forget it.  What are we talking burnout here?
Wonderful.  Ran into a convention of auto dealers at the Drake Hotel.  You hear the one about the astronaut who comes back from the first manned flight to Mars after two years?  His wife's got a year old kid.  So he says "All right.  Who was it?  My friend Harry?"  She says no. "Oh, it was my friend Sammy."  She says it wasn't Sammy.  "Oh, I suppose it was my friend Lou."  "No, what's the matter, don't you think I have any friends of my own?!"
He's our guy.
No, not in a hurry.  What do you think? You think the plot'll work?
Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize customs records -
Keep counting Claire.
Of course I can hear you.
Jack...that's spying.
Jack you're so wicked.
Connection denied.
Phew!  Weíve got five minutes...
He didn't used to be cheap. He thinks if he holds on to his money, he will never die.
Well, what do you wanna talk about!
I never seen anybody so in love like Cosmo back then! He'd stand outside the house all day and look in the windows. I never told you this cause it's not really a story. But one time I woke up in the middle of the night cause this bright light was in my face. Like a flashlight. I couldn't think a what it was. I looked out the window, and it was the moon! Big as a house! I never seen the moon so big before or since. I was almost scared, like it was gonna crush the house. And I looked down, and standing there in the street was Cosmo, looking up at the windows. This is the funny part. I got mad at you, Cosmo! I thought you brought this big moon over to my house cause you were so in love and woke me up with it. I was half asleep I guess and didn't know no better.
And that's how much I'm saying.
Ti amo.
What killed him?
Him? He's a big baby. Why isn't he here with you telling me?
That don't sound like Johnny. Where's the ring?
Everything is temporary. That don't excuse nothing.
You're my daughter. I won't have you acting like a tramp!
Alright. I didn't see you here.
Maybe I should come back another time.
I know that. I do what I want.
You think so?
I was raised that a girl gets married young. I didn't get married until I was twenty-eight. I met a man. I loved him. I married him. He wanted to have a baby right away. I said no. Then he got hit by a bus. No man. No baby. No nothing! I did not know that man was a gift I could not keep. I didn't know... You tell me a story and you think you know what it means, but I see what the true story is, and you can't.  She didn't leave you! You can't see what you are. I can see everything. You are a wolf!
No!
I was dead, too.
I want to cut you open and crawl inside of you. I want you to swallow me.
Don't just become excited.
What did you do?
I can't do that!
Hi.
Come on.
Yeah.
I wanna go home.
Yeah. It smells like snow.
Come upstairs. I don't care why you come. No, that's not what I mean. Loretta, I love you. Not like they told you love is and I didn't know this either. But love don't make things nice, it ruins everything, it breaks your heart, it makes things a mess. We're not here to make things perfect. Snowflakes are perfect. The stars are perfect. Not us. We are here to ruin ourselves and break our hearts and love the wrong people and die! The storybooks are bullshit. Come upstairs with me, baby! Don't try to live your life out to somebody else's idea of sweet happiness. Don't try to live on milk and cookies when what you want is meat! Red meat just like me! It's wolves run with wolves and nothing else! You're a wolf just like me! Come upstairs with me and get in my bed! Come on! Come on! Come on!
Is Johnny here?
No. I'm gonna wait.
Loretta, what are you talking about?
Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?
Hi.
Johnny.
Bobo, take the cart away.
Alright.
Seven-thirty.
A week. Two weeks. No more.
I'll take care of it, Johnny. I'll take care of the whole thing. All you have to do is show up.
Who is he?
Where's the ring?
And who's gonna pay for that?
I got married before, you didn't sell.
She's dying. But I could still hear her big mouth.
Not yet. That old lady makes him sweat.  Where's that card?
Everything's different.
No. Are you drunk?
Yeah, Ma, I love him awful.
That's a pretty big sin.
Cosmo drank five glasses of wine at dinner.
I came right from the airport.
Where is she?
A miracle. Well, that's news.
Johnny...
You're forty-two years old, Johnny, and Mama is still running your life.
Sure!
What happened?
She was just too young for you.
Sure.
No.
You're a little boy and you like to be bad.
Good night.
Marriage is happy news.
WE NEVER SUSPECTED YOU!
So how can we tell if she is made of wood?
Does wood sink in water?
Yes!
Through ... We found them.
You must return here with a shrubbery or else ...  you shall not pass through this wood alive!
One that looks nice.
I command you, as King of the Britons to stand aside.
'Tis but a scratch.
Come on you pansy!
You'll what ... ?
What are you going to do. bleed on me?
You're a looney.
Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he'll be very keen. He's already got one, you see?
Oh yes.  It's very nice + +  CUT TO BATTLEMENTS. THE TAUNTER  turns to some others. + +                              MAN +      I told him we already got one. + +  They all giggle. +
This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere.  Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.
No!  Not the Knights Who Say "Ni"!
That's it.  Ni!  Ni!
Just keep me covered.
A G...g...g...
What?
I warned you!
It's always the same ... if I've said it once.
Yes, I see.
Shut up!
Well, don't. |      I really don't know where all this got started. It's like those miserable psalms.  they're so depressing. Now knock it of
... Well, we did do the nose.
Why do you think she is a witch?
You're not fooling anyone you know.  Isn't there anything you could do?
What is the capital of Assyria?
Yes ...  I'm very sorry ...
But I don't want any of that, I'd rather ...
I'd rather ... just ... sing ...
Well ... I'll tell you ...
Leaving the room.
Look, it's  simple.  Just stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room.
No, not anyone else - just me.
What?
The Prince ... ?
Oh, I see,  Right.
The what?  But you are tired and you must rest awhile.  Midget! Crapper!
What is your name, handsome knight?
No, no, we must find the Grail.
No.  It's unhealthy.
Please ... we are doctors.
Brave, Sir Rob ...
Seventy a year.
Come on, man.  There's love and there's ...
John, it's not your problem what she eats.
You watch your tongue.
What do you take me for?
I don't think I've had that pleasure.
I see.
I'm flattered you think so.
Are you deaf as well as stupid?
And that is my last word on the matter.
That's a tautology lad.  If you say the Queen arranges something, you've no need to say she's done it personally.  That's understood.
Back and upper corridors.
Aye, do.
I beg your pardon?
There are important papers from --
I believe that decision rests with Her Majesty.
I don't doubt that the Queen was highly amused.  She has always had a very healthy sense of humor.
Occasionally.
I'm not married.
I said.  I serve the Queen.
Why do you think I keep her here?
They aren't as watchful as you.
I'm glad of it.
Yes, ma'am.
It's a fine spot, ma'am.
Sir Henry is not alone.  They all wish it.  The same people who refused to grant my husband the title of King because he was deemed of insufficient rank--
Who by?
That doesn't make him an expert.
I do not accept.
The Queen forbids it.  I cannot allow it because I cannot live without you.  Without you, I cannot find the strength to be who I must be.  Please.
In so many ways ... and yet it is your presence they crave.  A figurehead.
Forgive me, ma'am, I cannot speak for the nation, only for myself.  As Prime Minister I confess I miss your presence, but that is only an expression of my own selfish desires and I should not burden you with it.
So?
Excellent!
Some young page was boasting about having seen it.  Lucky.
The same, your Majesty.
We were expecting you to return by six.
I have no idea.
Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.
You ordered all members of the Royal Family to attend you at Balmoral.
He has typhoid fever, ma'am.
Getting there.  It's more sensitive than a joy-stick.  Your video-character can respond as fast as you can.  But what can I do for you?
If I tell you, then it's no fun.
What's the question mark?
Well, brain-dead anyway.  Coma patient. It's really not all that important.
Neither are we.  Something's wrong with the game, Mr. Difford.
There's something wrong with ARCADE. The game's alive somehow...
What the hell does that mean?
But he was playing the game.  I mean, you saw him...
Have you played the game yet?  It's incredible!  I was just...
I'm in the middle of it...
Quiet.  I do have parents, you know.
She thought Benz was at school.
It doesn't necessarily mean she's...
Like the fractals?
What?
No I'm not...
What are you going to do?
I already have a boyfriend, Nick.
Screamer.
There never is.
Never been on a snowboard.
I know.
That way.
So what's so different about Arcade? You guys've been talking about it for months.
I'm going home. I'll call you later.
I know, but you're broke. Where are you?
And getting stranger. Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean do I have to ride out to the range?
I'm just offering a place to stay.
There is no problem.
Okay, I'm thinking.
Good then, but, just in case, that bank's gonna stay closed a bit longer. You understand that?
No, this one doesn't count. It's part of the original one. So then ... until we meet again.
I'm sorry Mr. Kesher, but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card.
That's fine, Mr. Kesher. You can pay cash when you check out. I'm sorry. it was my duty to inform you.
Honey, all the great ones came through here at one time or another.
That's good. They're allowed, but I don't like 'em...for obvious reasons. One man used to live here that had a prize fighting kangaroo. You wouldn't believe what that kangaroo did to this courtyard ... let's see your Aunt's apartment ... it's a good one.
Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler.  Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. If you want, later I'll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. It's just up the stairs we passed. It's open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there.
His name's Wally Brown .... great guy. Been in the business since forever.
Naw! He wouldn't have cared. Just give him a good performance and he'll be happy and I've got a feeling you'll do just that.
Are you okay?
Yeah ... Betty. You don't rush it. I don't rush it. We play it close, just like in the movies.
I'll go with you. She's still got some of my stuff.
Oh...
I'm not. I don't know what my name is. I don't know who I am!!
What do you mean?
Maybe that's where the accident was. There must be a police report. We could call.
Just to see if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
Come on... let's find you something to wear.
Not that I can see.
I'm not sure about this.
"Before what?"
Good luck!
What is it? What do you see?!
What ... I..HAVE... to do.
No, no, no, I told you. They're fine. They're all real happy.
This Denny's.
Yeah.
Two men... two guns in the Caddy.
No. Could be someone's missin' maybe.
Yeah... just .... Dr. Scott's got 'im. You remember Dr.Scott.
Find out who they are?
Interesting.
Not a coke or anything?
Sure, reach in my shirt pocket there.
Where's the dock ?
Look I don't even wanna know how I got in this mess. I just want out. It has nothing to do with me.
I'm not listening.
Okay.
Let's go.
The Brooklyn Bridge.
It'll end. It'll end with him and McCay. Then the park shuts down. Permanently.
Hey , Hey !
I told him not to sit down in there.....
Either you'll be shot with bullets, impaled with a large spike, or nailed like a super model. Basically you're fucked any way you go.
Not quite....
What the fuck are you talking about.
Let's just see if he can make it into round two....
What ? Are you my mother ?
RESPECT is earned not given away, trust is given away to anybody.
I just want to double check the facts.
Yeah, but we're talking 43.
For once in your life, shut the fuck up.
Fire the whole division. We're moving more of the operations division into Manhattan anyway. Whoever is left over from the conversion is no longer needed. We already have all the key people here. Anyone else is expendable.
I thought that was Darwin, sir. Or perhaps Nietzsche ?
I had suggested that they tone down the program so that the "guests" might take longer to expire.
But sir, most of the people we are putting into the "Park" are accountants that embezzle or investment bankers. They are not known for their physical or intellectual prowess.
That's right, sir. He does a thorough background check and if he finds them to be criminal or guilty of embezzlement, then he will put them in the park. He has refused the last three suggested "guests".
Sir ?
Sir, he created the Park. He would know how to circumvent any of the traps.
Fantastic ! A little faster sweetheart.
I'm just looking for our best interests. May I have the tapes, Bruce ?
I was.
What are you looking for ? A blow job ?
Then what do you want ?
What ?????
Of course, this one's a gimme. Just be patient, even Ol' Bruce can't outwit some of these traps.
I'll see that bet.
Well, Mr. Parker it seems that your is not the wardrobe of choice tonight. I'm quite confident that my tie is looking better than yours.
The room will fill to the top, then if they wind up in the next room, they lived, if not, they're dead.
He's got two chices.either it's the Bowling Alley from Hell or Alice in Murderland. See this ? Even Bruce knows that no one can make it out of here in one piece.
I've never heard the Flintstones reduced to a sexual exploitation quite like that. You're funny.
If they're so rich, why are you working at all ?
What the hell kind of cop are you ?
Maybe all that testosterone plugs his ears.
We just having our first date when you showed up.
I was thinking maybe we should try this dinner thing again, but maybe the Epcot version will be open by then....
Where are we ?
Good morning.
UCLA? My cardigan sweater period.
Your Uncle Phil told me.
Well if I was looking for a victim, I definitely wouldn't pick your Uncle Phil who outweighs me by about 150 pounds, besides, who would I ask for ransom? You??
Don't mention it.
Suspended from school, my mother??
Well the thing is your room is right next door to ours, and so we thought, well, I thought, if you were willing we might move you to Grammoo's room, and use your old room for the nursery. See we're gonna be up half the night with a newborn and there'll be a lot of noise....
Well not far, just down the hall. Plus Grammoo's room's a lot bigger, and you get a view of the whole neighborhood.
No, I just thought it'd be nice if the two of us had an evening out so we could... talk.
What boy likes you?
Hi Dad.
I just called to say that I'm having a really great time.
If I eat it I'll throw up.
Vada I wanna ask you a favor, remember you can absolutely say no if you want to.
Maggie Muldovan? Did you...know her?
I'm sorry, it's just...I've been taking all these seminars to get in touch with my feelings and...sometimes it gets out of hand.
I'd like to, thanks.
Hillary Mitchell? How's she?
That's all right, you know what? You sound just sounded just like your mother...she told great stories. Stories with crazy accents and...special effects.
Well, we didn't have a camera...so she just wrote the date on the bag and said, &quot;This will be out wedding album, this will be a day we will never forget.&quot; We never did.
It's just a corpse.
You should be here when they bring in a body that's been dead for a couple of days, and they haven't found it yet, 'cause it was in an apartment, and no-one came to visit, or floating in a river, and then the body starts turning this weird shade of green, you know, like watery pea soup? The arms and legs deteriorate first, the body looks like a raisin with four fat legs. Anyway, this is why I'm seriously considering cremation. Judy??
Neither can mine. She's dead. It's Shelly who's pregnant.
It's Kevin, I don't want him to see me.
He likes you.
Boys always pretend they hate you when they really like you.
No, not here in Pennsylvania, she went to Russia undercover with her acting troupe and got a lot of highly sensitive secret plans sent back. Just when she was about to go home, she got caught, and they killed her.
Give it back Nicholas!
I won't.
TAXI!!!
Well look, I know that all you care about is your precious mini-bike. It's obvious you have no sense of historical perspective, I think we're here.
Who are you? Hitler's hall monitor?
This'll be great in my report, my mother was suspended for smoking.
May I use the phone please.
He is one of the great poets.
At least it gives you plenty of exercise.
And I thought I was weird.
Well, I hope he's not watching me all the time.
Give it to me!
Big deal.
And you'd be my cousin?
He's an undertaker.
You better ace it...you sacrificed our whole vacation.
Was Rose.
They're great.
Okay...take your time...I'll...I'll go for a walk around.
You know how I feel about you.
All right, well get to bed early and don't let anybody in. Bye.
She'll be all right baby.
Oh, ahh, oil change, I...ehh...I just drove in from Chicago and uhh...nice hair.
I was commenting on your hair.
Well let's just say you're lucky you deal with children who are under anesthesia.
Sort of?
No. You know they say, that it never rains, that you can barbecue on Christmas day...instead of riding your bike, you just surf over to your friends house. Oh, and the place is just crawling with celebrities. I know someone who saw Walter Matthau picking up his dry-cleaning.
What do you mean?
Hey! Oh look.
Everybody did, walk along Citrus between Fountain and Sunset any afternoon.
How do I know you were gonna show us one?
All right, here.
Can't stay, I'm just here because my wife.....
This guy bonking you?
What?
Yes.
No.
Deceased.
Oh, You still want it? Even though uhh...
Great, you can start right away. Call me Harry. Now, umm, is this what you'd normally wear for work? Don't get me wrong, I like it, very much, but the....
Oh that, she just likes to play.
She's a perfectly happy eleven year old girl, look, don't give me any advice about my daughter, okay?
Oh Hi, what can I do for you?
Oh, how do you mean?
Okay, sure.
Old Spice, Phil says it's a timeless classic.
Really?
Look, you're not gonna take Shelly's camper.
Is it really your camper?
That's a lot of money for a little girl.
Last month you wanted to play the violin. Then you wanted to be a ventriloquist.
Ahh, maybe next summer.
Why?
Sorry.
Ahh, Vada, just put anything you want in the cart, anything at all.  I don't know what's gotten into her today.
Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car.
Are you sure about all this?
No, she's just driving over here, then we're taking my car. How do I look?
That's what I do. Do you wanna do it??
It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading.
Well I'm gonna teach creative writing this summer, so, I'm doing some work.
Do you think she is?
You know what I think? I think Vada's very lucky to have a friend like you.
Probably.
Nephritis? It's a kidney disease, you don't get it from hot dogs.
Oh great!!
Vada, Vada, what's the matter?
What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
Uh huh.
What are you saving for?
Oh wow, a real evil canieval.
Hi Mr. Bixler!
Why? It's not dinner time yet.
It's only black when you're around 'cause you put me in a bad mood.
Oh no!  UUH.
You could pick that scab on your arm.
Uh huh.
That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. Come here, i'll diagnose your head.
Yes.
What?
For their meat.
I'm tired of running away. Besides, we past this place two times already. We're not getting nowhere.
Then go home, baby.
Leave then, some friend you are.
Please, it's real hot, maybe we can go swimming?
Like they do on TV?
But then I won't be able to see anything.
Okay, seeya.  Vada?
Would you think of me?
Well, I'm close to her.  I wanted to meet the one that got away.
I honestly wish I could...
Which is everyone you couldn't get in.
Solid and genuine is not boring. Michael can be completely insane...
We're about to find out.
I have a suggestion...
You've been working on this, huh?
I wish.
I can't even say it.
Oh, you're more than okay.
You need a few dollars.
I can be quick.  I can even be funny.
I've missed a step.
... whatever is manly and independent.
We settled this.  And I reneged. That wasn't fair.
They'll eat it anyway, you ever been to a walk?
This must be... very, very, hard on him.
I had this crank call?  From some guy who thinks he saw her? I said, what would a bride be doin', on her wedding...
I told him, get the important stuff, Kim's ring.  I'll collect the inconsequentials.
Nobody has.  So far.
I need to make some calls. Could I use... your office?
Well, somet...
What's next?
First girl I ever knew.  Who lets me give her a bath.
Boy, those were the days.
No.  I've got you.
If you like.
Have you.
ISN'T THERE A GUARD?  A JANITOR? A FUCKING CLEANING WOMAN? I'LL TAKE A BURGLAR!  SOMEBODY'S GOTTA BE IN TH...
No, it's for the best, it really is.  We were so wrong for each other.
Oh, yeah.
Shhh.
I came here, looking for her.
This is where I proposed.
That is so romantic.
I travel every week.  College ball, motor sports, training camps...
To the twins' soiree?  So they can paw you and drool...?
No, it's, uh... a real big favor.
To him.
With those big, dark, haunted eyes. As if you were harborin' some... unspeakably... guilty... secret.
Well, I just wondered 'cause being from out or town I wouldn't be able to make anything.
What's wrong honey.
Eater  says she doesn't see how you do it.
Green.
Bye, Bye.
Haven? Hell,' we've been playing poker together since we were fourteen.
A little slow, but she'll be fine.
Who the hell is he?
What does he want?
Yes. She's pretty rested up.
President.
Sure thing.
How come?
It's the den mother.
National?
The Hell he did. Look, I'll see you in the morning.
I'll just be in here.
Your brother?
Ester and me did;  My niece picked then. She's just here from California.
Yes, ma'am. How are you today?
I'm fine. Can I go up?
No. Mr. Green, I don't know how to tell you this -- your wire passed away -- I thought they'd called you at home.
She's been in the hospital two weeks yesterday.
Well I've been following him around Just listening to him --He says he can really win -- I bet he can too - -
I don't really know what you're talking about.
No.
Oh, well, thanks. Ah, oh, maybe you know where...
I've been so worried, dear. where are you?
How are you going to pay when you get sick?
Green?  Not Owen Green. Owen Green embezzled money from your grandfather
Does their hair fall out?
Bye.
Just my church and my boys. We all had to go to school and learn hand talking. I just thank the Lord they can see.
No, mostly his wife's. She's in Paris, France, right now. My husband Delbert is real friendly with him. Delbert's in law. Does work for him.
Wow!
Oh.
Older.
Well...
That's unkind.
Linnea?
You sound different. Is that really you?
Can you make a rehearsal in the morning...?  Courtland wants to...
Money's no object.
Don't you worry about Sueleen Gay.
You're doing some recording here, aren't you?
You're not.
They're looking all over for you. Do you have a copy of the album.
Oh?
We're connected by a relative. One time, one of his aunts married one of my uncles. That was a long time ago, though. How'd you come to work for him?
Who?
I'll be damned. Boy, if you could get Ryan to say something about Hal Phillip Walker, wouldn't that be something?
You bet.
May I see your costume?
I see.
Yes you are.
Yes, I did. That's why Tim studied it. Because it was Bruce Lee's fighting style.
What...
It wasn't 'till we got on the ground floor that I totally realized they weren't gonna shoot unless we shot first. When we got out of the stairwell, I remember thinking, 'Oh my God. This might work.' But Mickey knew it would work all along. There wasn't any doubt in his mind. It's not like there was and he just didn't show it. He knew it would work.
We still got a few tricks up our sleeves.
Now that you bring it up, yes. They were different men. I hadn't really thought that much about it. Since many psychiatric opinions are, by a rule, sought out for this kind of situation. What do you think normally happens? The Knoxs are assigned a family psychologist that takes care of them throughout the rest of their lives? The state doesn't work like that.
Lobotomy Bay?
Mickey's better half herself. Mallory Knox. This little lady drowned her father in a fish tank.
How's it goin'?
Okay, Wayne, step forward.
It's video.
How 'bout Manson?
She sings? What does she sing?
Don't worry about it.
Then was it worth it?
Was massacring all those people worth being separated from your wife for the rest of your life?
No, Mickey, I can't let you get away with that shit. Answer the question. Was it worth it? You haven't seen, heard, or smelled Mallory in a year. Was it worth it?
Excuse me, did you say an instant of purity? What was the instant of purity? The bodies you left behind on your bloody trail?
You'll never understand. Me and you, Wayne, we're not even the same species. I used to be you...then I evolved. From where you're standing, you're a man. From where I'm standing, you're a ape. I'm here...I'm right here... and you...you're somewhere else, man. You say why? I say why not?
I'm sure we will.
That's indescribable.
Okay, let's cut it.
Sure.
Let me check on Scott. He's hurt bad.
Out front.
No fuckin' way!
You made every day like kindergarten.
Unfortunately, yes.
Have you seen 'Pumping Iron?'
Mickey and Mallory have that edge.
Mickey stops sawin' on my leg and says, 'Oh my God, I'm your biggest fan!'
They were especially influenced by 'Conquering Huns of Neptune.'
Where do the air ducts lead?
It's hard to say Capt'n.
Thanks.
We got his stinkin' ass in the deepest, darkest cell in the whole place. But it just so happens that right now he's got a special visitor.
They're real Goddamn good. They'll be there for when ya need 'em. Where are they?
Yeah, sure.
Well, basically, what we did was put part of the old show on first...
Slate it.
Fucking dammit! Mickey hold onto that thought. Reload, quick!
Super cool.  This is great stuff. How ya doin'?
Now, Phil, I don't know if you've ever been on a set before---
Really?
See what I mean? It's a funny business, isn't it?
Okay. I'll take two guys off.
I'll cut it in half. Four guys, but that's it.
Don't call my men assholes.
Stay up here and finish your interview, I've got to see what the hell's going on down there before I can take responsibility for you to film there.
Thanks, Duff. You' a nice guy. Not like Frankie.
See Duff. He's the money man.
I still don't know what you're talkin' about.
Like where?
Thanks.
That ain't my idea of friendliness.
Like hell they wouldn't.
Yeah, I been there.
Oh yeah? That's good.
Why don't you come over for a beer when you get through?
You work around town?
Went to college, huh?
No. Never had much use for hell-howlers. You goin'?
No.
That's right.
That's fine with me. Keeps me out of trouble.
You got a problem all right.
It's better than it used to be. Eight years ago they still had a lynching here. They tied a man to a car and dragged him to death. My father knew who did it, but he didn't say anything.
That's the way he is.
Just for the day?
Are you married?
Look, baby - I don't know 'bout you, but it's the right thing for me. I just know it is. So, what d'you say?
Well, what d'you think?
Duff - you know those women you used to know--
You didn't answer my question.
We'll be all right.
You will.
Yeah!
What the hell could you do?
What're you going to do?
Like what?
Yeah, see you in hell.
Wouldn't have known you.
Better get him to a hospital.
She don't look no worse to me.
Don't do her no good to go into a tree.
He's been hitting it pretty hard. Got high blood pressure, too. I guess it's hard on him, having you around.
Yeah, sure. Good luck.
I guess I'll make me some trouble in that town.
Oh yeah?
'Oughta give up smoking, Jocko.
'Musta knocked her up.
What d'you know about women, Pop?
Hell, I didn't know you was married.
Hi.
Okay, boy, beat it.
Omar, listen to me--
Since when?
Splendid. We'll prepare a welcome for them.
It's nothing. C'mon... we've got to transfer those funds and get the hell out of here.
Straylight. Kitchen dock.
Skeleton key. This opens the gates of Babylon.
Why not?
You son-of-a-bitch, you're crazy.
And how do you suggest I do that?
Put the Sense/Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf.
Thanks, but I was enjoying that dependency.
This one's different. No one can trace it. It's out there somewhere in the matrix and it's growing stronger... infecting other computer systems like a virus.
It hasn't yet.
You'll be ready for a trial run in two days. If your splices hold, you'll use McCoy to trace the A.I.'s coordinates.
What's he doing to my gear?
Could be your A.I.'s calling card.
Offworld. The A.I.... this "Wintermute" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems.
We won't have to. The run is tomorrow night.
Can you read my mind?
Patience, Mr. Case. Only one hour and thirty-eight minutes to enlightenment.
I don't have a girl.
As far as they know, that's absolutely true.
Okay, Dix. You _are_ a ROM construct.
I an' I, man. I an' I.
This place empty as a tomb, mon.
The girl 3Jane. We need her.
I an' I, Case. Jah guides us.
Right...
You're Dixie McCoy's construct. That makes you something special.
No problem, amigo.
Can you take me to it?
That's pretty good cause he's only working with one lobe.
The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?
We got problems topside.
Not for long. It needs me alive and I still need its access code. You got a better idea?
How long, Dixie?
Less than thirty minutes.
How's the ice?
I said, it's coming. Just get me in, man.
3Jane's the only person beside Tessier that knows the code.
People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.
Shut down your ice patterns. I'll take you out.
Why should I want to meet him.
For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.
I know who he isn't. Not C.I.A. Not Sense/Net. But... money comes in. Doors open. He's onto something.
What?
What the fuck... are you serious?
Too late?
Won't that mean you're dead?
Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine.
I'll be okay.
Everybody's favourite computer, of course. He may have out calculated the rest of you, but I have certain qualities that don't translate well on microchips.
Try being named after a guitar- playing pussycat.
Hey--I went to Northwestern!  Once. To use the bathroom.
– uhh, must have forgotten-
Last night. 7:30. Big Cup. I kept calling you, but I only got your machine. I don't even know your parents line and I was really worried.
Roger in Op/Ed. Don't make me send you another memo about my policy on inter-office dating.
Love. Who knows what that is? Now circulation, deadlines, those I understand.
OH! How about "Under the Sea?"
You did. Yesterday you said, and I quote, "I have a date with Roger from Op/Ed tonight and I'm going to do it with him."
Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
Jos, that's not what we're --
The girls threw them at me in the locker room.
Hidden camera.
Do I want to be crunched?
Geller, you don't want a reporter's life. They're very--messy. You're all about order. Control. And getting me my copy by five.
No, it's the Great and Powerful Oz. Now listen--you're in over your head. This is how it's gonna work. I review the tapes, I find your story.
You already pitched this to Rigfort?!
Are you in special ed?
Josie, you rock my world. You're like the most amazing girl I've ever dated. You're so smart and fun and crazy! You rock my world.
But I'm not a penguin.
I'm Rob's prom date.
Someday this luau is going to be all mine!
You can't just "borrow" my car for a couple of months! That's like ten years in Bambi life!
No. They're at the Franklin Hint Expo at the Skokie Holiday Inn.
I can't do this.
This is it Jos! This is my ninth inning! The game isn't over--I just thought it was!  I get on the Southglen baseball team, the right scout sees me-- I'm into the minors- it's game time!
Thanks. And what are -
I know.
Really?
wasn't even thinking about-
I'm Josie. Geller. I think the school would probably be pretty comfortable with you calling, me that. Josie.
Sorry. Forgetful.
You like her?
Thanks. Wow. That's--really nice to hear.
I'm gonna tell you something here, and I hope it doesn't undermine my position as an authority figure. I'm a little afraid of heights.
I don't have to say that.
That's okay. It's nice to have someone to talk to--
When are you going to open your eyes?
Thanks.  They weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee?
That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us--
Do you think you'll find her?
Why?
Nah uh.
We're very evolved.
Rob, I mean it. I want you to be my first. Me and you. Once the floor stops spinning, let's have sex.
We can handle it.
Where?
No!
I'm grown up now.  I have to leave some time.
I know.
Oh, come on Dad...
Oh, please...
Jesse's dead, Lisa.  Freddy's here.
Where's Jesse?
She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.
Not too far.  My folks bought a place over on Elm Street.
How come?
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Yeah.
Traumas of a ten-year old.
That's typical.  I hope she didn't expect to make the best seller list with this thing.
Research.  Hi.  C'mon, let's go for a ride.
I don't know.  Concentrate or some- thing.
Maybe it only happens when you're sleeping - that's the way it was with Nancy, wasn't it?
Oh, Jesse...
he's just waiting to take me.  When I sleep.
No.  I'm okay.
Sure...go ahead.
Hi, Kerry.
Morning, Doctor Goldman.
I gotta stay up, Max.
No fuckin' way.  We're a team.
Do you still...see each other?
But...it's just a house I've dreamed about.  I dream about it all the time.  Thank you for what you did last night.
How do we find him, Kristen?
I don't know.
Can't be good news coming from you.
A little basic, but nice.
She's been waiting outside your office since breakfast.
Thank you.
Shit, that's what keeps people alive.
You'll get to meet them all tomorrow. They're...survivors.  In a way.  All severely sleep disordered.  Insomnia, narcolepsy, bedwetting...
Sounds like a rough time.
I've been to Pittsburgh.  Does that count?
Okay...I believe in different levels of conciousness, that sort of thing...but if you're into UFO's or Atlantis, you've lost me.
You want me to prescribe an experimental psychoactive drug to a bunch of suicidal teenagers?
Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in by tomorrow?
Breathe deeply and relax...starting with your toes, relax everything until there's no tension left in your bodies.  None at all.  Keep following the pendulum...
Everybody take five.
There's nothing we can do.  It's out of our hands.
Don't you think I know that?  I don't have any choice.
Your dreams?
Freddy Krueger.  He was a child murderer before he died.  After he died, he became ...something worse.  Six years ago Freddy killed my friends. He almost killed me.  I thought I got rid of him -- but I guess he was too strong.
Sshhh.  No time for that.  Come on.
Neil, please --
No.  We're alone.
I come from time to time.  When I'm needed.
Purgatory...fashioned by the hands of men.  Twisted, lost souls, the worst of the criminally insane, were locked away in here like animals.
You must find the remains...and bury them in hallowed ground.
Cooling down.
Frankly, I don't understand why some grad school superstar is being treated like a seasoned pro.
Uh, fourteen.
Oh, it's just down the corridor on the right.
Films mainly.
Fifteen million dollars.
Don't worry about it.  I thought the apricot and honey business was the real lowpoint.
Right.  No one.  I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes but... don't worry -- I won't believe it.
You played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call.
Yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try.  Four o'clock could be good.
Hello.
No, it's my fault, I thought this would all be over by now.  I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing.  I seriously don't know what got in to me.  I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it.
Thank you.  You are 'Horse and Hound's' favorite actress.  You and Black Beauty.  Tied.
You abide by rules like that?
You said 'whoopsidaisies.'
Step aside.
I don't know, I'm afraid.
I'm sorry... I don't know what to say.
Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.
Oh no no -- no.
'No, turn over 4 TRS's and tell them we need radar feedback before the KFT's return at 19 hundred -- then inform the Pentagon that we'll be needing black star cover from ten hundred through 12.15' -- and don't you dare say one word about how many mistakes I made in that speech or I'll pelt you with olives.
'Thank you.'  How many mistake did I make?
'Cartwright, Wainwright, whatever your name is, I promised little Jimmy I'd be home for his birthday -- could you get a message through that I may be a little late.'
My son's name is Johnny?
Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve to say 'inform the Pentagon that we need black star cover.'
You actually have clauses in your contact about nudity?
It's one hell of a job.  What do you put on your passport?  Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom.
Who was Gilda?
Stay forever.
I do.  Your furry friend thought he'd make a buck or two telling the papers where I was.
That's spectacularly unfair.
I mean -- today's newspapers will be lining tomorrow's waste paper bins.
I only found out you were here yesterday.
Okay.
Hello.
Fine.  Everything much the same.  When they change the law Spike and I will marry immediately.  Whereas you... I've watched in wonder.  Awards, glory ...
Yes.  The thing is... I have to go away today but I wondered, if I didn't, whether you might let me see you a bit... or, a lot maybe... see if you could... like me again.
You expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in England?
That's very good news.  The readers of 'Horse and Hound' will be absolutely delighted.
Is that right?
Oh God.  Oh God.  Oh Goddy God.
C'est la vie... We're lucky in lots of ways, but... Surely it's worth a brownie.
Is Miss Scott staying here?
Me?
Well, thanks, that's great.
How you doing?  I thought you guys all wore those penguin coats.
Oh great.  Could you do me a favour and try to get us some really cold water up here?
And maybe you could just adios the dishes and empty the trash.
Any bit in particular?
Ahm right, right, I liked the bit in space very much.  Did you enjoy making 	that bit?
Shall I go get a cappuccino?  Ease the pain.
But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.
Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?
Okay.  Tell me, would I have to pay a wet rag as much as I pay you?
Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
Okay -- perfect timing as ever -- hold the fort for a second will you, Martin?
Every time.  But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.
Is it someone we know?
Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...
Oh right.  I mean, I am a friend -- I'm not a lunatic but -- no, you basically...
What are the choices?
Yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind.
Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.
It's not yogurt -- it's mayonnaise.
Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes...
So -- any messages?
Right.  Right.  You think it's the wrong moment.  Fair enough.  Do you mind if I have a go?
Yes.
What book?
Okay -- what if I did have a book down my trousers?
No, Miss Ratched...
I can only speculate as to the reasons why.
You should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here!
Billy, that girl couldn't have pulled you in there forcibly...
No! No! No!
Mister Washington.
Just that I'm glad to be here, Miss Ratched. I really am.
Yeah, well, it just pains me somethin' awful to see a full growed man sloshing around in his own water...
Not at all, Mister McMurphy...
Well, say. How 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose?
You sure run a tight-assed ship 'round here, don't ya!
Right!
Very well. What is it you're proposing, Mister McMurphy?
But there are eighteen patients on the ward, Mister McMurphy.
Mr. McMurphy, you had no right to take these men out with you!
Ma'am, I'm as gentle as a puppy dog. Why, I haven't licked the tar out of an aide for two weeks! Hi ya, Doc!
I-I d-d-don't know! M-M-Miss R Ratched g-g-g-g...
Soo, fare-the-weel, darlin'. I'm gone on my way, My wagons are loaded, My whip's in my hand...
C-C-Come here and l-look at th this!
Yeah, well, let me tell ya somethin'... While I was up there gettin' in-lightened, I came up with one hellava plan...
Good boy, thank you, Billy.
M-M-M-Mack?
Well, okay, but I just want to look at the facilities. That's all.
Atta boy, Cheswick!
They went that way.
I dunno. Where do ya wanna go?
Huh?
Shhh...
We'll go back just as soon as we find those guys! 'Kay?
Does that mean we have to cut him loose?
Through the ass.
Me, too...
I'm seeing what a busy man does.
I'm not talking about Fred Yoong or Maxwell Jones, buddy, what I'm talkin' about is that crummy meeting and what that nurse did to you!
Tell 'er to go to hell anyway!
Lobotomy?
A baseball game isn't worth the risk, my friend.
With your own two hands?
I'm not talkin' to him! I'm talkin' to myself! It helps me think!
I don't trust you!
Sure, Mack...
Yesterday...
Hold it a minute.
Yeah, Mac?
McMurphy, Doc. R.P. McMurphy.
Good. Good.
Shoot, Doc, the only one I'm disturbing is that old nurse and her fixed ways. That's all.
I'm afraid not.
What's the horse pill for, honey?
I'm not upset. All I wanna know, for the lovva Jesus...
'Kay!
I want you to write me a letter to my brother for a hundred dollars to bury me.
Because I quit breathing.
Yeah, yeah, you're a fucking phony, McMurphy!
You're on!
Yeah, what's up?
I tell ya, there's an angel of mercy standing out there, Turkle.
To help you relax... please...
No...
How's your ass been holdin' up, honey?
He's in charge.
Hit, you say? Well well well and with a king up, the boy wants a hit. Whadaya know. So comin' at you and too bad, a little lady for the lad and he's over the wall and down the road, up the hill and dropped his load.
Hey, Martini! Psst! Scanlon! Ya dumb goons, come back here!  Come on, let's get 'em!
This way, Mister McMurphy.
I'm sure you will.
After you, ma'am.
Nobody leaves here till seven thirty.
Ah, no, ma'am... well, yes, ma'am...  A man get awful lonely at night, if ya know what Ah mean, ma'am...
Yes, ma'am...
What's that?
Is he one of the loonies?
Are they dangerous when they're awake?
You don't understand.  The man I'm supposed to marry is on that plane.
It was late in arriving.  But it's here now.
Mr. Bradley left about a half hour ago.  He said his plans had changed unexpectedly.  Would you prefer an interior or exterior room?
No.
Let's find a telephone.
Yes.  We did.
Oh no.  Do you?
Except possibly that.
Ask her if she knows where he is?
What's mezzaluna?
Don't be stupid, Larry.  If he's my destiny, then, obviously, he has to be alive.
But Faith--
Hi there...
Thanks.
You said whatever it was you would understand.
What?
Because I don't have the right name?!
Where's Positano?
Mickey Spillane?
Thank you, Peter.  Thank you so much.
I just wanted to keep an eye on you.  The guy's a total stranger, remember?
The Sun Also Rises.  For Whom the Bell Tolls.  The Old Man and the--
Yeah.
I feel like the world's biggest idiot.
No, it was more than that.  It was very generous of you.  It was very kind.
You want a hint?  I'll give you a hint.  You are the lowest, most despicable, most reprehensible form of reptilian swine--
Well, I might've found him again if I hadn't left Rome to make this pointless trip down here with you.
No, it isn't.  I called off my wedding all because of you.
That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?
There is no us.
I brought you that, too.
Brunello di Montalcino, '85, please.
Uh, the scampi sounds good to me, too.
Oh, hello.
It's a metaphor.  It's women who always think there's some unknown out there that's going to be better than what's in front of them.  And instead wind up with nothing.
I think if you're honest with yourself, you'll admit you've had a chance at a number of Amana appliances in your lifetime.
So, what's your point?
No, Faith.  They came out of somebody's imagination.
How hard can it be?  I'll land there, I'll go to his hotel, I'll introduce myself, and--
The book said they have boats that are like taxis...  Vaporettos.  What's the name of the place we're staying again?
What'd you find?
'Course he does.
Her brother.
I told you.  If he sees me here with another guy, he's gonna think I'm here with another guy.  I just don't want to send any confusing signals.
Is he looking at us?
Okay, here's what I think.  We find out what all the subway stops for that train are-- the subway system's really not that big in Rome, we could narrow it down and--
Don't be silly.  How's a psychiatrist gonna find him?
Hi.  Where've you been?
I know, but...
What about Peter?...
What if he doesn't like me?
Or maybe it'll turn him back into a toad.
Yes.  He is.
So.  I guess I've got a wedding to go to.
Actually, no.  There's not going to be a wedding.
And Larry?...
I don't know.  I've just been thinking... maybe this destiny thing is more of a do-it-yourself operation.  Maybe the things that are meant to be are the things we want badly enough to fight for.
No.  Well, I don't know.  Well, maybe.  Later.
I'd love to.
I thank you.
You don't have to go if you don't want to...
That's exactly what you are.
You miss me?...
It's not exploitation.  These people wanna sell and I wanna buy. How are golf clubs exploitation?  She takes one night class and suddenly she's a socialist.
Are you saying you just made the whole thing up?  The guy never even existed?
She didn't give me a chance.
Talk louder. I can't hear you.
If I talk too loud it's the fault of the nuns.
What do you mean, odd? We was robbed like I told you.
So they're walking along and smiling. That doesn't mean he's going to talk. There's no evidence until he gives public testimony.
Then don't.
That was the idea.
Maybe he gave them an argument.
In a minute.
But going in that church, I'd be stooling for you, Charley. You make a pigeon out of me.
You know, the boys are getting rather interested in your future.
Maybe.
And for all that dough I don't do nothin'?
Don't say that!
Gee, when you tipped one seventy-five you were beautiful. You should've been another Billy Conn. That skunk I got to manage you brought you along too fast.
Edie, I do what I can. I'm in the church when you need me.
Give it to me— my Pop's job—
Everybody knew him. He got around.
You training to be a nun or something?
Looked like two pieces of rope. And your teeth were—
Now you got me! It's a wonder I wasn't punchy by the time I was twelve. The rulers those Sisters used to whack me with!  They thought they could beat an education into me—I foxed 'em.
Pardon me while I reach for my beads.
What-what? Where you been the last four five years? Outer space?
Well he played it smart. Too many good-for-nothin's around here. All they got on their mind's a little beer, a little pool, a little—  I better get you home.
I don't know.
How about another one?
Naw, in the ring, a dive is-
Want to hear my philosophy? Do it to him before he does it to you.
Yeah, yeah... .  This Father Barry, what's his racket?
Edie, down here it's every man for himself. It's keepin' alive! It's standin' in with the right people so you can keep a little loose change jinglin' in your pocket.
Why keep harpin' on it?  Come on, drink up. You got to get a little fun out of life. What's the matter with you?  I'll play you some music.
I don't want it. But why don't you stay and finish your drink.
What for?
It's fun dancing with your eyes closed. I'm floating. I'm floating... .
Why worry about me? You're the one who says only look out for yourself.
Look out for number one. Always number one.  I should've known you wouldn't tell me. Pop said Johnny Friendly used to own you. I think he still owns you.  No wonder everybody calls you a bum.
Go ahead, wear it.
Who says?
How can you be with Charley and Johnny Friendly and still be with me? Either way it's a lie. It's like there were two different people inside of you. You've got to be one or the other.
I never mentioned the word before. In his agony he grips a glass standing on the night table.
Get away from me.
He's going to have to grow up too.
You heard what Johnny said. No part of the Waterfront'll be safe for you now. Maybe inland— the Middle West somewhere— a job on a farm... .
You always said I was a bum. Well—  —not anymore. I'm going down to the dock. Don't worry, I'm not going to shoot anybody. I'm just going to get my rights.  Joey's jacket. It's time I start wearing it.
A question of who rides who.
How much is your soul worth if you don't?
You go to hell.
Have a seat. I'm trying to find out just what happened to Joey Doyle. Maybe you can help.
Those blood suckers. How I'd love to fix those babies but—
Are you on the level, Father?
Take it easy.
I told you I don't know nothin' and I ain't saying nothin'.
Sure... .
Raise a hand to me and... .
I told you lay off.
's all right, kid. I took care of 'em myself this morning.
Looking for me?
Aw, you know I don't like to count, Johnny.
Not a dent.  Perfect
Well, no, Johnny, I just thought I should've been told if—
You mean Kayo Nolan, the old timer? He doesn't know much.
How'd you get that.
Come on. I want you. You're mine. You're mine! Come on!
I was only talkin' to her.
I can't believe it— a small fortune.   You can't buy me— you're still a bum!  'Bye, Edie. Lord have mercy on Joey. 
When we knock off let's have a bit of a party. We'll drink to God and Ireland, its whiskey and its women, to Joey and Edie—  and death to tyrants everywhere... .!
Well, fact or not, I don't see how we're going to find an ancient cemetery in these mountains tonight.  I can't see a thing!  Let's turn back.
Okay.
Then..then what's that music?
I can't imagine anything dead playing that music.
I'm not sure...
Be careful!--They'll see you.
You've got a right to be. We're trapped by a bunch of fiends.
I'm frightened.  I'm so frightened.
Maybe so.
Of course I do.
A situation easily remedied.
At your discretion...But first, I desire more entertainment.
Then see that it does not happen again, in the penalty of Everlasting Despair.  Now are there others?
For what!?!
You mean...!
Is there time?
Aahhhhnnnaaahahnn. AaaaaahhhhoooWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Aaarrrgggaahh.
Aaahhnnnahnnnn.
Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't monitored?
Emil the Amazing.  The bastard fired me and hired another girl, a redhead. I'm working on a new business card, pass out to the cafes.  How's this sound--
Yeah, that's him.  Buddy says Glenn thinks you guys are real cool.
Yes, it is.
Who is it?
He did?  I don't remember.  Did he say about me?  In the trunk?
Huh.  Problem is, Jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks.  It's all he's ever done.
Listen to me.  I'm a good friend of Jack Foley.
He ain't the problem, Jack.
He's running for his life, he doesn't give a shit about you.
Uh-huh...
Now you're talkin'.
They don't stay the night, Jack, 'less you pay for it.
Forget about my sister.  If Karen Sisco's tailing Glenn, we're fucked. Tomorrow night at the fights we all get picked up.
Jesus, look at that wall.  Place almost looks like a prison.
Let fate decide?  What're you, the fuckin' Dali Lama now?
Yeah, it's called Glades Correctional Institution and I'm sure as shit not going back there or any place like it.
Yeah, and I better call my sister.
Yeah, I did.
I don't know.
I'm not leaving you alone with these assholes.
Shit.
I'll go with you.
Jack --
Oh... different things, prison, movies.
When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't know he robbed banks.
You'll have to ask him.
Where are you?  I been trying to reach you.
There was a Buddy Bragg at Lompoc around the same time Foley was there.  We got an address for him at the Adams Hotel in Hallandale.  I want you to go there, see if you can get the manager to i.d. him as the other guy.  If he does, you call me right away...
Yeah, sure, Karen.  You bring in Chirino, you can be on the task force.
I could walk out of here.
Excuse me, Adele?
Yeah.  And I thought everyone liked Eddie.
I report to the FBI, first thing they're gonna do is ask me to go get some coffee.
Listen, Raymond, a year ago, DEA had this guy Glenn Michaels on possession with intent but couldn't make it stick. In his statement, Glenn said he went up to Detroit to visit a friend and look into job opportunities -- if you can believe that.
It seems to me I been reading about you in the newspaper.  Busted out of some joint in Florida, huh?
Just like it.  Nobody backing down. You back down, you pussy.  Tell me what you and Buddy doing up here in the cold?
Warm?  Man, it's ninety-five degrees in here, sometimes a hundred -- the way Emanuel always kep' it so his boys'd sweat, get lean and mean like Tommy Hearns.  No, I ain't talking any business in here.  To me this is holy ground, man.  You understand?  I got to be someplace anyway.  Y'all want to talk, come to the fights tomorrow night, we'll sit down and look at it good. The State Theater.
We're leaving.
Buddy.  That's his given name?
Tell you the truth, I don't know.  I started when I was eighteen, driving for my Uncle Cully and his partner, Gus.  They go into a bank this one time in Slidell, Gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg. All three of us ended up in Angola.
Of course I am.
What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I don't think it would help much.  I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, well, if it turns out I get shot like a dog, it'll be in the street, not off a goddamn fence.
Shit...
Yes.
I'm just worried maybe I'm not old enough for you.
Sure.  I'll just leave 'em with the S.W.A.T. guy answers the door.
You won't do that.
I don't have a problem with it.
No.  What do you do for a living, Gary?
It would be worth the risk.
Yeah, but in a nice way.
I'm just going to the bathroom.
You just did, for Christ sake.
Who you talkin' to, Studs?  Me, or Buddy.  I can't tell, you got those shades on.
I guess the bright glare out here made it hard to see the numbers on the weights.
How many?
Really?  Well, I uhhh...
Of course not.
Twenty-two months, three days, two hours.  Why?
Hey, Jack?  Bullshit.  I didn't make my first million until I was forty- two.  Forty-two.  You really <u>want</u> to change, it's never too late.
Who is?  But then you gotta look at a job as more than just work.  You gotta look at it as peace of mind.  As <i>security</i>, you know what I mean?  I got offices in Detroit, Miami, Boston, take your pick.
The fish saved my life.  Two years ago, I found out I had high blood pressure.  So my doctor, he tells me to go get an aquarium, look at the fish every time I felt myself stressing out.
Maurice Miller, couple of his friends.
I'm not angry, Richard.  In fact, I'm completely relaxed.  Thing is, I can't tell if it's the fish that're cooling me out or all those uncut diamonds on the bottom of the tank there.
If that's my fate, so be it.  I'm not leaving.  I love her, Jack.
For a time.
Meaning time came, I left.
That time?
Hejira.
Cheaper I guess, take us both down in one van.
Like what?
You're gonna bust me for picking up a car?
Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at his office tomorrow, take him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills.  Now, I don't give a shit what they do.
Oh, I'm here, all right.  I'm very here. Question is, why aren't <u>you</u> here?
What-- when?
Great.  We got one of 'em.
He said he stayed here last November.
He said he stayed with Maurice.
Your dog was killed?
What did you call it?
It's a --
Happy birthday, kid.  You want another Coke?
What're you doing at Glades?
You'd meet doctors, lawyers -- nothing wrong with them necessarily if they're divorced.  Why settle for some cowboy cop who drinks too much and cheats on his wife?  That's the way those hotshots are, all of 'em.
Huh.
The Sig Sauer you got me for my birthday.
I see that.
My married boyfriend - setting him up with that news story so you could talk about infidelity.  I couldn't believe it.
I didn't have time.
He doesn't seem to hold a grudge.  What <i>I</i> want to know is why, they got such a big score up north, did Foley hang around Miami for so long?  Any thoughts on that one?
I told you, he isn't here.
That's right, just me.
So the woman's married.  She goes to bed with this prison escapee because he misses his little girl and then tells the world about it.  But you don't reveal her name, you protect her.  It sounds like you're saying it's okay as long as her husband doesn't find out about it.  Like the guy who cheats on his wife, saying what she doesn't know won't hurt her.
Not so fast, Dick.  Starting now, there's gonna be an across the board cost a living increase.
Yeah.  Sure.  It's all settled.
That's your line for tonight, ya know.
No, numbnuts, die.  You get your nurse alone, you look her in the eye, and say, "Baby, they're training me for war, and I don't know what'll happen.  But if I die tomorrow, I wanna know that we lived all we could tonight."  I've never known it to fail.
You mean hiding them?
Ooo, she's thinking of her date!  Come on, you've been dating a pilot.  We want to know what we can expect.
Yeah.  But if I have to get something out, I c-can always s-s-s-  SIIING!
Not anxious to die, Sir, anxious to matter.
Sir?
Hale-what?
You guys know her?!  I gotta have an intro!  Man, I'd like to --
A m-missionary?
They'll all fly, but -- oh, shit...
Of the four left, only one is full of fuel.
Danny, you know how many times I saw you come to school with a black eye or a busted nose, and couldn't do a thing about it -- for you, or for your mother... or your father, with his lungs scorched out with mustard gas, and more left of his lungs than there was of his spirit? You've made your sacrifice, Danny.  It's time I made mine.
It's a test.  If I asked her to come and she came, it wouldn't tell me anything. If I tell her not to come, and she comes...then I know she loves me.
Why be sorry?  That's what you feel, it's better to come out with it.
You don't wanna put beer over mai-tai.
Tighter 'n a bulls ass in fly season. Don't hit the barn.
Little less.
Home of the brave.
I'm out of fuel!
Longer?  It's getting shorter.
We'll get separated over the target, but you and I will rendezvous for the run to China.  I'm on your wing.
Home of the Brave.
You were more like brothers.
He said you're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him.
Colonel...we're all going.  Whether you make it or not.
Boxin'.
Yes'm.
You waited til tonight to tell me?
How did you?...
It's not your fault, Rafe.  The letter I wrote you, they --
It's not that I didn't mean everything I wrote.  It's just that -- I thought you were dead.  And now --
We have a fighter screen up, in case we are attacked, Admiral.
Have the planes made it to China?
God help them.
All of 'em.
Learn English, then!
If knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then I have misunderstood what it means to be Japanese.
Peggy Sue!
Well, I like to speculate. This book I'm reading right now, a woman in Colorado says she lived in Ireland a hundred and fifty years ago. Her name was Bridey Murphy- and she gives names and dates and where she lived. She was hypnotized. Big bestseller.
Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?
Your first boyfriend. What do you think? Any sparks left?
I can't. It's all too much.
Were taking you back to the nurse.
You better watch out for her. She's after Charlie.
I know. Put Scott through college.
Maybe I blocked it out.
They'll learn to live with it.
I'm fine Peggy Sue. And how are you? Are we talking on the phone? Are we pen pals?
You're pretty charming when you want to be.
But you're the one who wanted to wait till we got married. And you were right. We should wait.
You mean my wang? Listen, it's running real late.
Save it.
Forget it. I've been thinking. Girls must go through that stuff too. Sometimes when I look at you I feel like an animal. Maybe my dad's right. Teenagers are nuts.
I have to talk to you..
Let's go down to the basement.
I bumped into him after you dropped me off Last night. I didn't feel like going home, so we went for a ride.
That won't make any difference. We just can't live together. And you had the nerve to drive up with that bimbo Janet.
That's real big of you.
You're kidding. You wrote a song? Is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy... she wants to hurt him, and he wonders why?
How could you possibly know what I've been going through?
I've got to go now.
I'll just set it right here.
Oh, God, Dion.
Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?
She seems confused, irresponsible, overemotional. My wife says that's the way girls act sometimes.
Charles, in spite of your adolescent infatuation with music, we've always regarded you a a fine young man. We've trusted you with our daughter.
First of all, Richard is not a creep. He happens to be an exceptional person. If any of you gave him half a chance, you'd find that out.
Okay.
What, why?
I wish she hadn't.
My children make me happy. I miss them so much.  Beth. Scott and Beth.  I'm going to name my daughter after you.
He's a fisherman! The most overrated writer of the century. I mean, he's the perfect American author — fat, violent, drunk...
Is that one of your poems?
I'd love to.
I hate chickens.
Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please.
It's hard to believe you're going to be eighteen.  Want an eskimo pie? Or a creamsicle? I'd come home from the store and there's little you running up to me. I'd give you a dime and you'd promise never to grow up.
That's very thoughtful, honey. It's just a slump. Things will pick up.
Didn't call, them pantyhose, though. What was it, Evelyn?
Look young lady, I grew up through the depression. I fought in the second World War. Six days a week I get up and deal with the public, the bank and the bill collectors. And on the seventh day, when God rests, I don't have to listen to my daughter calling me a fool!
Of course, dear. You're home now.
For what?
Instead of a girdle. And light as a feather.
Mom, how about a machine that's like your blender, only it slices vegetables, kneads dough, chops meat and even make fresh pasta?
I'm just happy to see you.
Where's Charlie? I was in town about a year ago and caught one of his commercials. Really made me laugh.
I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy.
What if it's beyond science? What it it's God?
I told you, I've already lived my life. I don't know how or why I'm here, but you have to help me get back. I want to get back to my real life!
Give me some credit, will you?
Wbat're you talking about?
Are you talking ~about exercise? Like gym?
Cheer up. Now you can give some other guy a shot. Make it up to him later and buy him a yacht.
Yes, every day.  Maybe I shouldn't have worn that dress? I told Beth it was a bad idea. That's why they made me Queen.
Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you.
So are you. You've got a vision.
Okay. Why don't we do something visionary. Change your destiny, Peggy Sue. Change your destiny and marry me.
Pretty much so.
Yes... why?
Uh... no. You just... look different than you sounded on the phone. Please, come in.
He doesn't. I don't know what he has, but I'm hoping to God it's not infectious...
All set.
Just until he heals up?
Say your goodbyes. Zowie's going outside. You're grounded, buddy. That's the new law.
You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad.
There's a better place...
You never get over it.
I don't know...  ...maybe it depends on what you were like before you...
Couple minutes. I saw the last shot. That was pretty cool.
Andy, do you know who reps Kronos Inc.?
You'll have to get right on it, Andy, we're up against the statute of limitations.
I don't know what to do, Bob.
Sorry...
Yes, Bob, I do.  Excuse me? Am I being fired?
Because they deserve to, Walter.
There won't be a next time, I guarantee it.
You're not going to like this. Please try to smile...
No.
Ready for what, baby?
Honesty is always best.
A carrot?!
Sounds delightful.
Your Honor, I submit there were no complaints until Counselor began knocking on doors, drumming up business. And the dust, which Counselor refers to, has appeared on only three occasions. Each time it has been examined and the results...
Funny.
Little baby girl.
Continue.
How many lawyers did you go to, before you called me?
As in, the vegetable?
Rayisha. Very nice.
They didn't fire her?
Let's find you a drink.
Correct.
What have you prayed for?
There's a possibility I won't be around for the end of this trial.
You're ready, don't worry.
What kind of person is that?
No. I didn't.
You don't bring your personal life into a law firm. You're not supposed to <u>have</u> a personal life, really. Anyway, I did plan to tell Charles, eventually. But then, this thing happened at the tennis club...
I'm an excellent lawyer.
Yes.
What?
Not unnecessary ones.
That happened once. People weren't talking about AIDS then, the way we are now. Or safe sex.
That is <u>not</u> correct. I never lied about it.
Isn't it true you have spent your life pretending to be something you're not, so much so that the art of concealment and dishonesty has become second nature to you?!
Hi, Mom. It's me.
Hold on, Mom.  There's no way my client will go along with that.
Are you on one of those conference calls? I hate when you put me on hold.
Thank you. No more questions.
Fact. Andrew Beckett performed at a consistently mediocre level. Fact. He made a grievous error on a multi-million dollar lawsuit... Fact. He claims he is the victim of lies and deceit. Fact. Andrew Beckett lied to his employers, going to great efforts to conceal his disease from them. Fact. He was successful in his duplicity. The partners at Wyant Wheeler did <u>not</u> know Andrew Beckett had AIDS when they fired him...
I'll withdraw.  You were aware, when you worked with Maria Torres, that she had AIDS, correct?
I'm not worried. What are you doing?
Why are we going to do that?
Not by touching, or shaking hands, or hugging, using the same toilet... Even kissing someone with AIDS is safe. But it there's something in your past you're worried about...
Uh.... No. Not really.
We were satisfied.
I might.
You're in trouble.
In a word, yes.
Do I look gay to you? Relax.
Fine, Joe.
That's perfectly clear.
Of course you have a case! Now, I want you to go with my assistant, Iris, and fill out some forms. She'll tell you about our fee arrangement.  Mrs. Finley? Any back pain since the accident? Dizziness? Nightmares?
Tell Iris all about it.  Take good care of Mrs. Finley, Iris.  Beckett, come in.
A trial takes <u>time</u>, Beckett. Do you know what I'm saying?
Like... two sailors playing hide the salami.
Hold it, Joe.  He wants to come back to work, Chuck.
Kings are out of fashion. I'd rather be thought of as a benevolent tyrant.  It's an anti-trust action.
Dr. J.!
Charles...
... But now, we're standing up for ourselves...
<u>What</u>?
Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?
Doesn't seem like enough to turn back on, does it?
'Mean the whispers?
Show me your eyes.
Look deeper.
Entered our minds.
Had it with deals.
What it's gonna be like when we hit that canyon. With her bleeding.
Think you've mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck.
I would try for them.
It's starting....
I think I twisted my ankle running backwards like that. And I'm not sure I can....  Okay, that's a lie. I just don't want to be alone back there anymore. If you could just give me a few minutes up front here --
Only around humans.
Tell me it's not a mirage.
<u>We're gonna find the body</u>, Johns. Christ, you're a cop. Why am I tellin' you this? We gotta go down and find it.
I never said I was.
And here you got two mornings every day. Wow, were you <u>born</u> lucky?
<u>You</u> made it a problem when you let Owens die like that. When you had enough drugs to knock out a fucking mule-team.
For your own fear.
We're just burnin' light here.
-- she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin, tried to kill us --
Ask if anyone has anything in cargo! Anything to drink!
Just tell me we're still in the shipping lane. Just show me all those stars, all those bright, beautiful, deep-space....
Can't get my nose down...too much load back there....
Company's not here, is it?
There is no "safe."
KEEP GOING OR I WILL!
Please...this solves nothing...please....
I'll need a receipt for that.  For all these.
Say that again.
If you were me, I'd kill us both. C'mon, you wanna sit at the grown-up table or not?
About the girl.
Just realized that, huh?
Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.
So which one caught your eye?
Maybe they had weight limits, you don't know.
Well? For a time the ancients kept humans as household pets.	Until the Lawgiver proved that man could not be tamed. Keep digging Cornelius. You'll find evidence of the master of this house: an ape.
No one really knows. It's an ancient taboo. Set forth in the Sacred Scrolls. The Lawgiver pronounced the area deadly.
What's so special about him?
And even if it weren't, why fly? Where would it get you?
I don't. And I'm not going to try.
Because if he is a missing link, it means the Sacred Scrolls aren't worth their parchment.
Zira....
Okay. If there's no life here, we've got just seventy-two hours to find it. That's when the groceries run out.
Let's find them all.
Blessed are the vegetarians.
That's because Dr. Zaius realizes our work has value.
Learned Judges: My case is simple. It is based on our first Article of Faith: that the Almighty created the ape in his own image; that He gave him a soul and a mind; that He set him apart from the beasts of the jungle, and made him the lord of the planet.
Very well. I suggest we go and look at them.
Sustained.  Your archeological theories have no bearing on the disposition of this creature.
Forget it. Abandon ship.
We're here to stay.
Sorry...  I was thinking of Stewart. What d'you suppose happened?
Then we've been away from Earth for eighteen months.
What would you learn? I've told you where you are and when you are.
There's only one reality left. We're here and it's now. You get ahold of that and hang on tight, or you might as well be dead.
Taylor.	I'm telling you --
Don't bother
Let's take a look.
Okay.
Try telling them our names.
You're our optimist Look at the bright side. If that's the best there is around here, in six months we'll be running this planet.
So you can talk.  I'm Dr. Zira's nephew. This abduction was her idea. You're not really going to the zoo. That's just our cover story in case we're stopped.  Although I do feel that if it ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be public or private property --
If you insist. But I'm not taking any orders --
In my world -- before I left it - only youngsters of your age wore un- scraped hair.
Always giving orders. Just like every other adult.
What is it?
I think you're making a mistake.
He wouldn't leave her.
Keep moving. We can't turn back now.
My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
Bailiff! Stop this outburst! Gag that monstrosity!
Then why is he called the accused Your Honors must think him guilty of something.
Oh, your case was preordained. In a way, you performed a service for the State ...  Because your hearing made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius.  And now the Tribunal has placed you in my custody for...final disposition. Do you know what that means?
Emasculation, to begin with. Then experimental surgery. On the speech centers. On the brain. Ultimately, a kind of living death.
What about it?
Thank you for calling me Taylor.  Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?
I don't know.
Don't be a fool. You're outnumbered and outgunned.
Okay.Up to the cave.
My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's Taylor!
You're going back to the Forbidden Zone?
Yes.
YOU - you're going to fuckin' jail, buddy, you ain't getting away with this one!!!!!
Don't tell me how to fight this fucking war, 'Lias, you go crying to fucking brigade on your time. Out here you belong to me. Now move.
Says he can't walk.
...everybody gotta die sometime Red... Get back to your foxhole.
Fuck you bitch.
That reminds me, I gotta take a shit.
Fuck that redneck noise, dude. All dem chicks be rappin' how dey losin' der' ho's and how dey ain't got no bread for beer. Fuck dat honky shit. Got to get me some motown jams, dig it?
I got one...
Yeah. How 'bout you?
Nah...
Fuck it, don't mean nothing, no such thing here as a coward, done your best man, next time y'do better.
Who gives a shit!
Not just me... it's the way the whole thing works. People like Elias get wasted and people like Barnes just go on making up rules any way they want and what do we do, we just sit around in the middle and suck on it! We just don't add up to dry shit.
Sounds like it.
This ain't Taylor. Taylor been shot. This man Chris been resurrected...
Merle? Jesus!... Patty?
He dugged his own grave.
I'm going to Vancouver, Mr. Mitchell.
I don't know.
Not tonight.
Just drunk enough.
Disgusting, aren't they? If you really want a Martini, I know where you can get one.
I don't need it that badly. I don't enjoy crashing other people's parties.
As I said before...
I can be talked out of it. As a matter of fact, I'd like a dry Martini myself.
Whatever you say.
I don't know you and you don't know me. I made a reasonably polite suggestion. But I'm sure you'd rather be alone.
What's funny about that? If you pick up people like Larry Mitchell other people are bound to get funny ideas about you. The world is full of Larry Mitchells.
He got in here how?
So there is. You don't want to go to bed. I don't want to go to bed. Let's go somewhere and hear some music--have something to drink-- something to eat--even dance.
Let's not pretend Mitchell meant anything to either of us.
I didn't notice him.
So have I.
That wasn't why I called you.  Why did I hope--when I hadn't any right to hope?
Yes.  I've never been very far from it, for a long time.  Will you do something for me?
How bad is the other thing?  The secret?
They'll look for you.
Killaine...
This must have cost a fortune.
Wonder what?
I guess I'm a little screwy.  Maybe I could believe it.  Should I try?
So that I will never be found.
Yes.  Yours.  You haven't murdered anybody.  You killed Mitchell. Wasn't that an accident?  It must have been.  If you kill a blackmailer, you kill him dead--so that he can't talk anymore.
Every day of your life you'll want me.  You'll never get over it. Every time you see your face in the mirror--
Ale. I don't mind.
It is?
A graduation present.
They're all crude, when they don't work. Had breakfast?
We wouldn't have met at all.
You were a galahad, compared to some cops I've known.
The police always do, don't they?
What does he see?
Very ridiculous.
What will they do to you?
You asked for it.
I'm not sure I want anything from you. You might want something from me.
You guessed it. The card's phony. I got plenty of 'em. Different names, different jobs. I work out of San Francisco. Go anywhere, do anything. All it takes is the folding.
If I call the police, your price will go down to a minus sign.
Charlie's suits me fine. I don't scare.
Leave that one lay.
What's a buzzer?
A private joke.
How's life treating you?
Don't kid me.  You don't think she murdered Mitchell.
That COULD BE TOLD.
I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately.
How would you know, Brandon?
And now that he's safe from all other women, you can go on loving him.
They'll arrest that girl. Everything points to her.
No, Not recently. I'm sure of that.
I've got a year.  Or a second. I'm not sure which.
I'd suggest a telegram.  Something like this: Chief of Police, San Francisco.  A licensed private detective named named Martin J. Goble, address so-and-so, has been found murdered within our jurisdiction.  His partner, name something-something Greer, refuses to give us any information. Correction.  Refuses information necessary to our investigation. Can you assist?  Signed Detective Sergeant Driscoll, Vancouver, British Columbia, Police. 
Thanks, Inspector.  What are your orders about this wire to San Francisco?
Go live in a tent.
One of those nice long manila envelopes--sealed.  Not too fat- not too thin.
You get it's brother.
Somebody did it twice last night-- in the dark.
I think so.
If I've got any sense I'm going to call headquarters.
So?
Did we ever really think it was suicide?
And a motive--which we haven't got.  So this could all be a dream.
I was in love with him... which shows you the quality of my brains.  Why don't you ask her about the gun?
Of course not.  Thanks for telling me.  I haven't seen Mr. Clarendon.
Perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems.
You would still have planted information that Clarendon knew about the gun--and not as an accusation, but in the process of defending yourself by making a confession.  Very neat.  Good morning, Mrs. West.
I'm interested in who handled it.
I'll take your word.
Aye.  You have a point there.
Nobody's covering her, I detached the officer assigned to that duty.
I disagree, sir.  As Inspector in charge of the case I have the right to form that opinion, the right to act on it.
With your charm? How could I help it? Have a nice trip?
Who's the girl?
She's very beautiful. She's much younger than I am. And she's rich, I hope.
Splendid. Now she can return the compliment.
She is much younger than I am. That's something I'm going to have to get used to. Isn't it, Larry? They'll all be much younger than I am. Here.  Tear them up.
I seem to recognize this routine. First the kiss then the touch.  Oh, what's the use. You're you.
Oh, forget it. Clark Brandon's throwing a party up in his penthouse this evening. Take me?
How about your new friend?
It's kind of you to see me.
What a shame.
We'll see you next week, and if--
I will, thanks.
Well, we were just...
Not too bad, thanks.  How have you been?
Don't tell me you've actually read it, Jeremy.
I see.
No, it's all right.  I can get a cab.  Night night.
Yes.  You're much too old to making a drama out of alienation, or whatever you call it.  You've got to take responsibility for your own happiness.  That's what I think anyway.
Who?
No.  We talked about history, and Siberian Geese.
No.  It's a bit of a madhouse. For some reason a lot of my mother's friends specialise in monologues.
I might.
Name so Susie Barrington.  Daughter of the eminent historian, Anne Barrington, step-daughter of the scandalous Matthew Byrd the acclaimed sack-artist...
To the Fleet.
The Argies.
Let me see.
Ha ha...
On the torture of very small children, but don't start telling them about their rights--
Tame those rights...you know, we're even freighting in a couple of exiled Argie trade unionists from Paris for a TV tie in.  One of them had his balls tap-danced on by the secret police.  The other one had to be hosed off the wall of his cell after the police-- yes my good man?
Will it be fun?
I'm not sure.
My God.  You even cooked up that Norfolk trip.
Hello.
Dad.
No.
She said that?
We might be able to dig out a couple of Suez survivors for you.
Voila!
Then one of them was sick all over your new dress.
No.
De nada.
Yeah, right, vision is highly over- rated.
'One shot stopping'... good, very good.  I like you, Johnny.  I like you because you'll sacrifice anything to win.  I respect that. It elevates you a little above the drones who have learned compromise. Here, hold it.  Check out the weight.
So, who... uh, who packed my chute?
She'll be fine, Rosie won't do anything.  At least not as long as I meet him at a certain place and time, about... let's see...  ... six hours from now.
Wild, ain't it?!  See, we exist on a higher plane, you and I.  We make our own rules.  Why be a servant of the law Johnny U... when you can be it's master?
I asked them to give me a couple minutes...
Sir?
Babes.
That's the point, isn't it?
What that?
The lab made three possible matches, this was one of 'em.
Guy's the Toxic Avenger.
Remember, all bank robbers are losers, but not all losers are bank robbers.
Cole and Munoz are going in the back door.  Babbit is backing me.  So I want you at the side window by the hedge.  You're strictly backup, got it?
Nice tattoo, Dietz.
Angelo, we gotta talk.
Kid, get outta the way!!
Shrimp and fries.
I'm serious.
No, no.  See, all my life I've done things for other people.  In high school I played football because my old man expected me to.  Then my parents always figured I'd go to law school, so I did.  Football scholarship.  Graduated Phi Beta Kappa--
Come on.  At least no one's gonna see how bad you are.
What?
Those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world. They're about to get squeezed. We can't let that happen. I needed someone who could get the job done, quick and quiet... no screw-ups. I needed the best. The best. So, I pulled a few strings at the State Department... and here we are.
Who's our back-up on this?
Jesus... this is inhuman.  Uh... I wasn't told of any operations in this area. They shouldn't have been here.
We've been lookin' for this place for months. The chopper must have gotten close when they got shot down. Hopper was sent in to get my men. He was just doing his job. When he disappeared I had to clean this up, I had to stop there bastards. We were so close, we couldn't quit. We couldn't sleep through this one. I needed you, Dutch, can't you see that?
Expendable assets, Dillon. Seems Langley is never around when you need them.
No more games.
This isn't your style, Dillon.
Right behind you.
I'll take him.
Philip!  We'll need shoes!
You're not getting any navy contracts.
What?
You've got a lot of nerve.
I don't question the legality of what you do.  It's your morality that makes me sick.  I will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you.
If you can figure it out, be my guest.
If you're making fun of me, I don't like it.
You don't know habits, you think this is ugly.
Company would cost you... a hundred dollars.
Then let's go.  It's worth 300 just so I don't have to drive.
Off the boulevard.
Can I have some chips?
Right.  So!  In town on business?
You didn't wake me.  I'll be out of here in a minute.
What?
Of course.  How much?
Some game.  Screwin' some poor slob out of his retirement.
Upset.  No.  I never get upset about business.
Whether I liked him or not is irrelevant.  It's business. There's no emotion involved in business... if you want to survive.
I have work to do.
Shall we mingle?
Ready to stomp sod?
Vivian, what the --
Vivian...
I don't want you to get too excited... these are on loan... however...
Shush.  Of course you can.
I'll guard them and you with my life.
What happened to him?
Vivian, I want you to listen to me.  The man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated.
It was good.
You shouldn't go alone.  He might claim that you tried to black mail him.
I'm here.
Eight o'clock.  Kross is bringing his son.  Very bright kid, watch yourself with him.  Who's this girl you're taking?
But, Edward...
Bill Stuckey, Vivian.  My wife, Elizabeth.
So now they're best friends? Edward, this girl appears out of nowhere and now I see her talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy.  It's too convenient.
Industrial espionage is not ridiculous.  Edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information?
I'm up.
Give me twenty minutes.
Let him answer.
Have a good day, gentlemen.
He's not gonna want us.
Yeah, mine too.  Is it like, y'know, normal?
Okay.  Thanks, Barney.  You're the best.
I like steak.
Maybe I'll just order a burger, Barney, that way I can eat with my hands.
Excuse me?
I don't think we have anything for you here.  You're obviously in the wrong place.
I just might do that.
You're a silly girl.
Then why is there fear behind your eyes?
And what am I?
As you wish.
Hear this now: I will come for you.
Well ... you were dead.
But how is that possible, since he's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago?
What? -- go on --
What hideous sin have you committed lately?
It's not my fault being the biggest and the strongest. I don't even exercise. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           38.
Well ...  ... you see, you use different moves when you're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one.
Veer left. Left. Left!
That leaves twenty for me. At my best, I could never defeat that many.  I need Vizzini to plan. I have no gift for strategy. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           82.
His true love is marrying another tonight, so who else has cause for Ultimate Suffering?  Excuse me --
Over the Albino, I think.
What is it?
That's right. When I was your age, television was called books. And this is a special book. It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father. And today, I'm gonna read it to you.
-- murdered by pirates is good --
Well, who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair.
Do you want me to go on with this?
Many of the thieves will resist. My regular enforcers will be inadequate.
It won't be easy, Sire.
DEATH FIRST!!
I wasn't finished -- the next thing you lose will be your left eye, followed by your right --
Yes.
That doesn't leave much time for dilly dallying.
Have you ever considered piracy? You'd make a wonderful Dread Pirate Roberts.
-- offer me money --
Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years?
He's already dead.
Are you a rotten liar.
That is a noble cause. Give me the sixty-five, I'm on the job.
Thank you.
Again. Thank you.
I was eleven years old. When I was strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, I will not fail. I will go up to the sixfingered man and say, "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."
You are ready, then?
Then why are you smiling?
Tell me.
That would be inconceivable.
You're sure nobody's following us?
Whoever he is, he's too late --  -- see?  The Cliffs of Insanity. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           19.
Oh, have it your way.
Good. Then pour the wine.
You only think I guessed wrong --  -- that's what's so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned. You fool.
An hour.
A little bit.
Mom, can't you tell him that I'm sick?
"To my honey I'll croon,
Ooooooops.
Koff, koff ... ahem, ahem ... harrumph ...
In looking at your books, I've discovered that ...
It's nothing ... nothing.
Mr. Bialystock ...
I went to a Turkish bath, who cares? The show was a flop.  What difference does it make?
It's not cheating ... It's charity. Bloom, look at me ... look at me! I'm drowning.  Other men sail through life.  Bialystock has struck a reef.  Bloom, I'm going under.  I am being sunk by a society that demands success, when all I can offer is failure.  Bloom, I'm reaching out to you.  Don't send me to jail.  Help!  Help!
Now let's see, two thousand dollars. That isn't much.  I'm sure I can hide it somewhere.  After all, the department of internal revenue isn't interested in a show that flopped.
Now let's see, if we add these figures, we get ...
What you were saying.  Keep talking.
You were saying that under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit.
You've done it yourself, only you did it on a very small scale.
You raised two thousand more than you needed to produce your last play.
Aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha!!  So, in order for the scheme to work, we'd have to find a sure fire flop.
You miserable, cowardly, wretched little caterpillar.  Don't you ever want to become a butterfly?  Don't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory?
Go away from me.  You frighten me.  Sit over there.
I already have.  Come on.
Coney Island??
I don't know.  Let's see.  We've had chocolate, vanilla, banana - let's go green.
You found a flop!
Shut up, you idiot.  He's a harmless nut.  Play along with him.  It's almost in the bag.
They'll say, "Oooh, wah, wah, wah, ooh, ooh."
Why?  Take it when you can get it! Flaunt it, baby, flaunt it!
Stop talking like that, you white mouse!  Nothing's going to go wrong. As a matter of fact, today I have taken steps to insure total disaster. At two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than Roger De Bris.
Here comes the Times Drama Critic.
To failure!
You mean out of business.  Heh, heh.
Come on.  Let's get going.
Got dag pa dig.
No.  We go. 
I shall count the minutes.
I don't know what's happening to me. I must be getting old.
Of Siegfried...
And last, but not least, Adolph... you know who.
"Deutchland, Deutchland ... "
Stop!  Stop!  This is insanity.
Heil, baby!  I just finished the morning propaganda broadcasts.
In the past two days I've been to so many motels, my eyes are bleary with neon. This is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large.
Or arrived with her.
Cash or check? For the cabin...
And when she left, she never came back.
She isn't still here, is she?
If she paid you well?
Or if she had you say... gallantly protecting her... you wouldn't be fooled... you'd know she was just using you. Wouldn't you?
No! Just no!  I have one of those breaking points like any other man, believe it or not, and I'm near it. There's just so much pushing I can take and I think...
Your girl friend stole forty thousand dollars.
What?
No. Thank you. I'm in... a hurry. I just want to make a change and start...
It looks fine. How much will it be, with my car...?
All right.
I'd really rather not. Please.  Can't we just settle this and...
He's lunching with the man who's buying the Harris Street property, you know, that oil lease man...  so that's why he's late.  You getting a headache?
I don't need pills... just sleep.
Just what he told your detective.
May I talk to you?
I want to know if my sister is here.
With you.
I hate tears. 
You might have doubted for say five minutes or so, Sister.
He must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it... All that cash...
You've led a charmed life.
Are we just going to go on sitting here?
You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.
Sam, I'm going.
Why can't I go out there with you?
Does that mean we can't...
You won't believe it...  But this will be the first time I've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers!
Someone was at that window. I saw the curtain move.
I'm glad we didn't.
How could we prove...  Well, if he opens a new motel on the new highway... say, a year from now...
Bates never denied Mary was here.
When you're married you can do a lot of things deliberately.
I've lost my girlish laughter.
I have to go, Sam.
We can see each other, we can even have dinner... but respectably, in my house with my mother's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three!
You make respectability sound... disrespectful.
Sam, let's go get married.
I'm late... and you have to put your shoes on.
You have a vacancy?
There's a big diner about ten miles on up... just outside Fairvale.
Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.
Thank you, Mr. Bates.
I'd like to.
Uncommon, too.
It's more than a hobby... sometimes... a hobby is supposed to pass the time, not fill it.
Oh, no!  I run the office, tend the cabins and grounds, do little chores for mother... the ones she allows I might be capable of doing.
I'm sorry... I didn't mean it to sound uncaring...
I am sorry. I only felt... it seemed she was harming you. I meant...
I stepped into a private trap back there -- and I want to go back and... try to pull myself out.  Before it's too late for me, too.
Then I'm free to go...?
Please... I'd like to go...
He's already been.
You must remember that bad business out there. About ten years ago...
Arbogast.
He told you he wasn't coming right back cause he wanted to question Norman Bates' mother, right?
It ain't only local history, Sam, it's the only murder-and-suicide case in Fairvale ledgers! Mrs. Bates poisoned this guy she was... involved with, when she found out he was married, then took a helping of the same stuff herself.  Strychnine. Ugly way to die.
Have you two had breakfast?
Better sign in first, hasn't we?
Go on, go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food... or my son! Or do I have to tell her, cause you don't have the guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
Explains the private detective. He traced her to the Bates place.  What'd he exactly say when he called you?
Yes! In the house behind the motel. I pounded and called but she... just ignored me.
Did she talk?
I don't know--I can't tell--
Papers--they all want me to sign papers.
Take him to the psychopathic hospital.
Do you have many patients, doctor?
Oh, just the basement. Some day I intend to build an experimental laboratory down there. It will save me from intrusion.
It won't do any good. They are a pair of would-be mur- deresses fighting it out.
Oh, <U>I'm</U> crazy, am I? Let me tell you something.  Those women have--the gleam--
Yes.
But ... the dogs...
No?
I can't convince the inner woman that we can wait. She's howling for a bit of ground beef before we drop in on Santa Claus and the other dummies. I've only had a cup of coffee since last night.
Ouch! Eat? You can do a solo if you don't step on it. I'm going to bow out on you.
No? Give me a chance, baby. Money is music in my ears, and when his old man kicks off there'll be a million dollar tune.
So that's the way it is?
The body of Joan Gale!
Don't take my word for it. Get down there yourself and give a look.
Been doing experiments with Scotch and soda again?
Great. Consider yourself crippled -- financially. See if you can jar your charming friends loose from enough to eat on.
What do you mean, you poor ham! This is New Year's!
Well, is it my fault if nothing happens?
That is none of our business.  But you bring me something for the next edition if it's only a recipe for spaghetti! 
If this kid was some unknown soda jerker, they wouldn't have pinched him. But he's George Winton and they're playing him up. It's a Roman holiday for every paper hat editor in New York.
Nope, I'm through!
Sleep on it ... we'll get it tomorrow.
I used to be married to one.
Come down to earth. Do you think they would dare do anything like that? Don't you think they'd know that figure would be recognized? Shake your head real hard -- you'll be all right.
That dear, innocent Judge Ramsey that you were so sure got bumped off for knowing too much has been located in South America.
What goofy idea have you got now? Don't tell me you suspect Judge Ramsey of stealing the body.
Well, maybe it was. I don't remember.  You got to do something for me, I can't stand it any longer -- I can't!
I've got to make news, if I have to bite a dog.  Hey, Kelly! Oh, mi gosh, even he walked out on me.
Say, if you're stringin' me, Old-Timer ...
Hotcha! Saved, one job!
There's an autopsy ordered at Bellevue immediately. You better skip over there.
Ain't that something. The mad monk of Manhattan. Here goes nothing.  Listen to the animal cracker roar like a lion.
Come on, old man, that won't do. You know you're innocent until proven guilty.
What! And let every rag in town grab a red-hot story? Not so you could notice it! Now, look, I want you to drive me around the corner and wait for me.
Heaven knows. A lot.
She will undoubtedly keep her promise. If you'll grant me the privilege, I'd like to submit this work to the Royal Academy when I get back.
I regret I can't spend the time I'd like with your exhibition, but I'm going to worry the life out of you when I come back. 
That is unfortunate.
Yes, there's our way out. A fire in this place would give us ten thousand pounds.
And you think I will permit this, my friend?
You're insane.
That doesn't seem so bad to me. What is wrong with it?
If you leave before the work is done, you will be gone for a much longer period ... you will be gone for good.
Quite so. Quite so.  And you, my little friend, my little Marie Antoinette. It is kind of you to be present.
He can't hear you.
Dad...
I'm heading out of town.
It's an experiment.
A five hundred foot thick steel wall.  But the connection between these two electrons is so --
Sex isn't ugly, sex is one of the most beautiful things in life, the creative power of the universe is behind it.
Buddy. Well, now, that's a nice name, I like it. I am real pleased to meet you.  Hey, look, do you think you got a cold drink of ice water somewhere?
They were just bad men, that's all.
Your Daddy is a wonderful man, I'll say that. He's the best and most kind-hearted man in the world.
What terrible thing in Cave Springs?
Well, it's only the truth. There are horrible things in the world, Rose.
What is it, Rose?
But, Rose, how could such a thing as that happen?
That was very interesting. Thank you, Rose.
Please, Rose. I'm curious, that's all, I have a natural curiosity, it's only human. You're my friend, aren't you? Don't you like me?  I like you, Rose, a lot -- in fact, I love you.
Am I hurting you?
Five hundred rabbits?
What was your mother like?
Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
Well, a little.
I don't know. But you better watch him like a hawk, if he comes back again.
Well, I don't know.  No, I don't know, Daddy, I think the rain has obscured it.
No, she hasn't.  I think I hear a car.
What did you say, Brother?
Now I have a plan about Rose, an educational plan. She's getting better and we don't want any more trouble --  Brother, you ought to hear this.
At least.
What are they doing?
Let me look.  Aww-rr...
You shouldn't watch such things, Doll.
She hasn't got any sense. In some ways, she's awful dumb.
That's the least of her troubles. Rose had a rare tropic disease and the little tubes in her that babies swim down are all stopped up, she told me all about it.
Your wife and children are back in New Hampshire in the snow?
No, son, she is dead.
I know. You loved her. So did I. It was an awful shock to me, too. An awful shock. Rose was so alive it's hard to believe.
Nobody lives forever, boy. Who'd want to?
Any major operation is dangerous. However, as we know from her previous illness, she's a very strong girl.
Slow, hon. But at least I can concentrate now that Rose is here.
There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about.
I think about what I'm doing all the time, and I've got as much business behind the wheel of an automobile as anybody. Besides, I want you to stay and help Rose with the dishes, the poor girl isn't feeling well.
That farmer in Gadsden was awful eager to get rid of her, and I'm beginning to see why.
You are the one who's good-hearted.  As for Rose, let's hope for the best.
No reason at all, darlin'.
Rose, I realize you don't know this boy, but if you know anybody who does know him, if you have even a faint clue as to who he might be, then convey to him that he had better stay away from my house and stop scaring my wife... and I don't mean maybe.
Just a moment! You are not going to fire this girl for an innocent thing like having boy friends, not while there is breath in my body!
Just a moment, dear.  We can't have it, Rose. Can you behave yourself -- or not? That is the question, to behave or not to behave, to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous chastity and keep your skirt down or to hoist it in the light of the moon and make whoopee -- that is the coil shuffling question.  If you can't behave I am going to fire you and I say it in front of you and Mrs. Hillyer and I mean it. I point my rigid finger right at your nose, Rose, and I stare unwaveringly into your big blue eyes and I tell you... this is a final warning. Do you hear me?
She's just nervous and worried. And you would be, too, if you had no job and no place to go.
I don't give a hoot in hell's hollow what it means to her! She can't stay in this house forever! I fired her, damn it!
Trickery and flummery or not, she's going there tomorrow on the bus! It's settled! And I must say we've been more than fair to you, Rose, it's pretty selfish and mean hearted of you to sit there and cry like that!
But she must know... unless... unless... Rose, was there more than one person?
Well, I know, more so. That's why I was thinking... maybe she'd be better off.
All right. Now as head of this household I have a couple of remarks to make. It is my dear wife's belief, which I accept although I do not totally grasp it, that to hire a person to do household work is a criminal practice. Therefore, you are here not as a servant, you are here as a friend, as a guest and hopefully as a member of this family. You will eat your meals with us, you will share life itself with us -- in love and harmony, dear Rosebud, in love and harmony. Do you understand me?
Don't make me... me... me... get up!
Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.
If you've got time before you go "out," get me a half-a-cup of coffee, Rose. Not a whole cup, a half-a-cup.
Well, it has buttons.
Yes, sir.
Oh, shut up, Rose, eat your cornflakes!
I have to go back to the hotel. I'm on duty at the desk and who knows a quest might arrive. I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
You mean a farm?
Mine.
Yes, mine. I'm going to have one.
What was it, Mr. Hillyer?
Awww-rr, Buddy, come on, you know me!
It's Dave Wilkie! I'm Dave Wilkie, don't you remember me?
Page proof of a book I'm working on.
Deathly afraid of it. Her people were poor tenant farmers and she doesn't know anything about doctors or medicine or hospitals.
Well, her people were very poor. She says she was often hungry as a child, and I'm sure the food she ate was pretty awful, not a balanced diet at all.
Gonorrhea?
Actually of course I won't operate, I don't do major surgery. Dr. Hardy will operate and of course he'll be guided by your wishes in this respect.
Oh, Mother, cut it out.
Rose, you work too hard. Why don't you go sit down somewhere and drink a Co-Cola?
Yes, ma'am.
I don't mind.
Well... well, that's wonderful, Rose.
I'm looking at this poster, and I'm thinkin', I don't remember seeing films like this when I was in school.
I figure, for this information, the usual payment... times ten.
Hey, listen... I'll give you something else, Kittle.  Anything. Remember... remember that corpse washed up on Huntington Beach?  It was never identified...
I don't know.  Fuck off!
Really?  Is that a fact... ?
I don't know what you're talking about, man.  Even if I did, I'm not so crazy I'm gonna cross Zimmermann.
Lay off once, would you?
I'll give you a fucking hoot if you don't shut up back there.
Yeah.
Clench your teeth so when we land you don't accidentally bite off your tongue.
Name one.
They shot us all, kid.
No, but it should.
What was I supposed to do?
We're not stealing.  We're borrowing.
You're lying...
No.
There probably is.
We've got the tape to prove it.
Well, shake a leg.  Get these files downstairs...  And, quit listening to your fucking voodoo music.
Well, sir...
You bust some small-time pimps, whores and dime-bag junkies, like the world's a better place because you're in it.  And for what, Kittle... two hundred and fifty dollars a week? Tell me, how does anyone get so self-rightious when they can barely afford to pay their rent?
Murderer?  Really?
First of all, the Constitution wasn't writtem till 1787...
Absolutely.
Slow down.
Shit.  You're right.
I know it is, even if you don't.
Who is that... ?
There's not even enough places to stash it in a car.
Beholden to none.
You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view.
But I have no sister.
Who are you?
You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.
His lightsaber.
Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance.
Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.
Han, don't. It'll be all right.
Lower it!
No, wait! I thought you were blind!
All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!
You, too.
Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect.  But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.
Let's see.
Red Leader standing by.
All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.
She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.  Why are you asking me all this?
Your father?
I know. Somehow...I've always known.
No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.
Your father he is.
Unfortunate that I know the truth?
Oh. Well, yes.
Certainly not!
And now he works for your Government, doesn't he, Brad?  He's attached to the Bureau of Investigation of that which you call U.F.O's.  Isn't he, Brad?
Rocky!
Made me give you the eye And then panic,
I've got something to say.
Yes, Janet.  Life's pretty cheap to that type.
Oh, it's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos.
For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.
It's just a..a party Janet.
Weiss.
No, don't do that.
So baby don't cry like there's no tomorrow After the night there's a brand new day. And there'll be no pain And no more sorrow. So wash your face And phone my place It'll be O.K.
And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to beat again. So give me a sign That a lover makes You look around The one you've found Is back again.
Uh - oh - Hi!  My name is Brad Majors. And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.  I - ah - wondered if you could help us.  Our car has broken down about two miles up the road.  Do you have a phone we might use?
You know this earth - this person.
I didn't make him for you
Makes you cry
Now I
Free to try and find a game
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime - That ain't no crime.
Creature of the night.
Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains.  To take that step to the right...
And our World will do the Time Warp again.
...I'm sorry.
My mother told me just the opposite. She said, 'You weren't born with much of a body so you'd better develop your brain.'
'Cause you can't sing or dance?
I sold them to you.
No, I don't belong here.
What?
Do me another favor?
I don't know -- I was shocked. Why did you do that?
Yes.
No... Sharp -- You look great.
-- The legs.
I don't want ya cleanin' nobody else's cages no more.
Apollo?
Don't say that.
Ya, ya goin' outta the bedroom an' I don't wanna know from nothin'.
Christ.
Listen, I gonna carry this boy three rounds, then drop 'im like a bad habit.
He's movin' to your left -- don't let him no more -- dance and stick, hear? Don't play -- I know what ya feelin', but don't play.
I suppose we could cancel the fight indefinitely if you are set on fighting Green.
Rocky Balboa -- His record's poor --
Very high an' very fast.
He was big, an' very nasty so I destroyed him in a hurry -- Now I'm gettin' ready for Mac Lee Green next month.
Does that bum have to say that?
Don't like yours neither.
It ain't your fault -- I originally done it in the Baby Crenshaw fight.  That's me fightin' Big Baby Crenshaw -- Big Baby was the size of an airplane an' I broke my hands on his head -- I lost, but it's a nice picture, don't ya think?
This guy is beautiful -- get the Cokes.
Thank you, Bob. The electricity is everywhere tonight. Rocky Balboa, a fifty-to-one underdog, is living a Cinderella story which has captured peoples' imaginations all over the world -- to quote a popular sports magazine, 'The fighting style should be 'The Caveman Against the Cavalier.' From the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring... His record is forty-four wins, twenty losses and thirty-eight knockouts.
Round three ready to start and should be interesting to see if Creed can put the challenger away -- there goes the bell.
That's it, I'm broke.
Waits! -- Be smart. Ya don't have to break nothin' -- Here, take my coat, it's worth fifty-sixty dollars. It's yours.
I figure if I break the thumb this guy gets thrown outta his job and can't pay nothin' no more.
Yeah.
Thanks, Mr. Gazzo.
No action.
I'm gonna do somethin with it.
...Thanks.
Absolutely -- Sparrin' with the Champ would be an honor -- y'know what?
Hey --
...Yeah.
Maybe I like garbage.
Why?
Ya hope I don't keep acting like a whore or I'll turn into one, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, Kayo.
Message -- What message?
Ya puttin' me on?
When was they here?
Turtles -- domestic turtles.
Yeah, ya kinda remind me of the Rock. Ya move like 'im.
Damn! How's it look?
See what?
Yeah -- See the fight last night? Apollo Creed beat that English guy bad.
Open my eyes -- Please, open my eyes!
Yo, Rocky -- Look at this mirror. I'd like to kill the friggin' moron who broke this mirror.
My sister's a friggin' loser.
Sometimes she gets me so crazy, I'd like to split her head with a razor.
Look at my hands -- See how the joints are swollen.
Yo, Rock -- now ya'll be lookin' for people to help, right?
...No.
Gazzo's a good man.
...It's cold outside, Paulie.
Feel? I dunno... Happy.
My problem is I got a fifty-year-old lust and a three-year-old dinkie.
You mean the rabbit?  They got him cold.
Check the scrawl.
Oh, yeah?  Well, you're not handcuffed to him.  Anybody in the back room?
Then why'd they bother to crack the safe?  You can drop a Mosler 90 from Mount Baldy and it won't open.
Maroon, right?
Ask her...
You're a very stubborn man, Mr. Valiant.  Very pig-headed.  Boys, show Mr. Valiant how we handle pig-headed men at the Toontown station...
No...
Not much.  It's hard to talk.
Only there's no business like it, no business I know.
The job's gonna cost you a hundred bucks.
Valiant?  What're you doin' here?
No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me.  They were waitin' for me when I got home last night.  I ran.
Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit.  We always run.
And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!
A Toon?  Noooo.
Safe?
That's why I'll be there at 8:45.
Not before I satisfy my sense of moral outrage.
Uh? Uh?
Then I'll leave thee.
Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover! I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes, By her high forehead and her scarlet lip, By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh! O, Romeo that she were An open ass, and thou a poperin pear! Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed; This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet, Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
By my head here come the Capulets.
Good-morrow, cousin.
In love?
Alas, that love, so gentle in his view, Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
A right good marks-man! And she's fair I love.
Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
The world is not thy friend, nor the worlds law. Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
She'll not come down tonight.
I uh, by and by I come--But if thou mean'st not well, I do beseech thee--
I am a-weary, give me leave awhile: Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I!
Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged! Give me my sin again.
Ay me!
Romeo, O Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name; Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes, And but thou love me, let them find me here: My life were better ended by their hate, Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
Thus..... with a kiss...... I die.
A man, young lady! Lady, such a man As all the world- -why, he's a man of wax.
I dream'd a dream to-night.
The slip, son, the slip; can you not conceive?
Sure Witt! Now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature.
NO! Mercutio!
OH, and but one word with one of us? Couple it with something. Make it a word and a...a blow.
Consort? What does thou make us minstrels? An thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing of discords. Here's my fiddlestick. Here's that shall make you dance! Zounds, Consort!
Sir. Ah, sir. Death the end of all
Do you really think so?
To make a point.  I don't know her, and I was ready to splatter her brains all over the sidewalk.  I don't particularly like you, so imagine what I'll do if you try anything...
I don't want you dead, woman, I want the the truth!
The deal?  The deal is we leave for Nice at first light.
And then...
Some places, not all.  Italy, for instance, they're serious about their food.  But try bloody Britain, anywhere in the U.K., you don't get much fancier than a deep-fried bar egg.  Food's not our thing, you see.
I drink what every civilized man, woman and child in the world drinks: Guinness.
It means I was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you.  You've been living the life of the hired gun -- the well paid hired gun, I might note.  There's no glory to it, but there are those that like it.
Would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there?
They're part of the team.  One of them's the guy I told you about.
Not yet...
The two of you were supposed to go to a simple meet and come back with a simple piece of information, and instead you went to fucking war...
Is that right?
I probably do.  But for the time being, I'm willing to forget about it...
You don't have to explain yourself to me, Deirdre.
You're a hired gun, Deirdre -- just like me.
I don't know...  Well I don't!  It's a goddamned mystery to me just like it is to you.  But I do know who we're working for.  My people, and the Russian mob.
Oh please..you're on some sort of holy mission?
I didn't say I was.
Not likely.  Once, yeah, I was -- but there wasn't an inch of profit in it, and I'm a cash oriented girl, if you take my meaning.  I'm a hired gun, same as the rest of you, and that's all any of us needs to know about the other.
Ready when you are...
No, Mikhi, I wouldn't.  Since I won't speak your language, and you can't speak mine, English will do nicely.
I don't have it with me...
Much to your disappointment, no doubt.
What I do is none of your concern.  What you should do is wait for my next phone call.  I'm going to find a place where I can tilt the field in my favor.  When I'm ready, I'll call you and tell you what I want you to do.
I hadn't thought about it.  Understand me, Gregor -- I take no pleasure in killing.  It doesn't bother me one bit, but I don't get off on it.
Really?
What a surprise...
Who the fuck died and appointed you food czar?
It's consider a virtue in some corners of the world.
I don't think so.
What makes you think we're here to meet you?
Coordinate what?
That's what I thought.
I asked if we could give him anything else.
Let's just say I thought the conversational possibilities were limited.  Of course, I might have brought Gregor, but he didn't seem like the right candidate -- for this.
You were smoking?
I never really thought I was part of the world you move in, Sam, to tell you the truth.  I'm a hood, a thief.  Big time in a small time king of way.  To the local police I'm a prize, to the local hoods I'm a legend.  But to a guy like you I'm just another two bit hired gun.
Not necessarily.  He could go off road at any number of places.  He might not even be in the country anymore.
Not exactly.
My job, Vincent, a job you don't need to know about.  I can't go to the local cops -- they'd never be able to get close enough at this point.  It's me or nobody, and I've been on this job too goddamned long not to finish.
You don't have to do this.
You see the bullet?
If Tony says this is it, then it's it.
I would have tried not to.  But yes, if it would have kept him from shooting you, I would have.
Why are you driving?  You're not French, you don't live here, you don't know these roads.  Why are you driving?
Why?  You've got more force of will than anyone I've ever seen.  You handle a gun like it's a part of you, you perform surgery on yourself without anesthesia...  And most amazing of all, you quit smoking, just like that.
I'll work on it...
Finish the job...
What?
You don't owe me a goddamned thing, Vincent, and you know it.  You stepped in front of a bullet for me.  I owe you a heavy debt.
You better get some sleep, alright?
I knew you'd come through. Jesse observes the transaction Booth and Earl start to leave.
The horniest dog in Nevada.
They're out of towners... Arizona plates...
There must be over a million dollars in here.
What do you mean what are we going to do?
Come on Booth!  Look at these scumbags around us.  Who's going to know what happened!  Let's take it and get out of here!
Hell, it won't be us!
Oh so God's like Western Union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks?
I don't know.
What's that?
That's not what I mean.
I don't know...
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
What are you thinking?
All we have to do is get our hands on the original tape.  We'll set him up somehow.
Well I mean it this time.  Come on.  Let's get this over with!
I don't know...we have to shut him up somehow. Booth looks at Earl --
How badly do you want that money?! How bad do you want to stay out of jail?
I sure as hell hope so.  Let's go.
It was all used.  Random numbers. How can they trace it?
We'll take the money and disappear! We can do it, spend it on the move. Even if all of it's marked, there's ways around it.
He found us, he shot her...he killed her...
I know, I know.  Dwayne's dead, but we can deal with it.  We'll pin it on him.  The DEA was driving Jesse's car. No car phone.  No radio.  They couldn't have called me in.
Dwayne had the opportunity, just like us.  He was at the scene.  He grabbed the cash.  Of course.  This is perfect!
Uh huh.
Two thousand...
Hello.
It's odd.  I don't know how Denning had the time, or the ability to buy something local, based on his situation.
Hi.
Oh.  You coming by tonight?
I'm in here.
There isn't gonna be a next time. We're gonna get out of here.
Well, I can't let you down now, can I?
I love you Sally.
Well I was just throwing out ideas...
I'll be there for you.  He won't try anything while I'm there.  I promise.  I'll protect you.
Shouldn't be long.  A couple of weeks maybe.
Yeah.
Cause we got footprints leading into that brush, I want to see where it leads...  Jesus, seven dead.  I'll tell you I've never seen carnage like this in all my seventeen years of sheriffing these parts.  I don't like it.  Not in my jurisdiction.
Dwayne.
What the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something?
Well I just uh, you know...
Anything...specific?
Yeah.  That's all I need, to become one of your in-laws.
Well, I just got a lot of things on my mind is all.
I can't hear a word you're saying!
Not much to tell.  Nothing really happened.
Just trying to be civil Dwayne.
Calm down --
Then what the hell are you all about?
Well you're not getting, either.
And not just any air conditioner. This baby sells for over six hundred dollars retail.
That doesn't tell us much. Did you run a check on the gas like I told you?
So...what's the good news?
So someone did get away.
I'm not getting an answer.
Hong Kong?  I'm not in Hong Kong.  I'm in Hollywood -- right at Sunset and Vine, two minutes from the station.  How about I pick you up right now and take you to dinner?
No, I just assumed...
No, sir.
How much is that?
Last party all he wanted was Sting -- not one person danced.  Tonight I'm doing Superfreak, I don't care what he says.  Where is he?
Is this about the funny money?
You've been asking loud questions in all the wrong places all morning.  How come you always save me for last, James? When are you gonna learn.  Shit don't happen I don't know about.
All right, Kenny.  Thanks.  You're off the hook.  For now.
The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name on the back was "Red Dragon."
Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you right now.
So what's your story?
I ain't his partner, I'm a tourist.  I got proof.  See, I got a mini-bar key.
Never leave home without it.  Lee, this one's on me.  You save your money.
I'm just in town for the weekend, taking in the sights.
You play games with me, Detective, and you'll lose every time.  Don't forget. The odds are always in favor of the house.
No.
Are you kidding, they love me.  I'm a star, Lee.  A god to these people!
You just said you're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking.
I'm sorry.
This won't take long.
Carter...you ready to have some fun!?
How you doin'?
Back to Heaven on Earth.  I need my damn passport back.  I'm going home.
Why you mad at me?  You needed back-up, so I backed you up.  I was about to take out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards.
You're pathetic, man.  When's the last time you had some fun?  When's the last time you took a night off, had a date?
Detective Yu?  Never met him.
Ask me if I give a shit.
This is about your Daddy's death?  Hell, Lee, you know my father died on the job. You could have told me...  This is about more than all that, isn't it?  This is about your Daddy's last case, right?
Why LA?
Almost, but you've got to say "Rich White Man" all run together like it's one word.
Gimme the binoculars.
Gimme the binoculars or I will shoot you.
What is it?
Take it!
I won't talk to you, you don't talk to me.  We'll die in peace.
I believe in heaven.  You people believe in heaven?
Fine by me.
There was no sex.  She was very traditional.  We were waiting until we were married.
Forget it.  It doesn't matter.
They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head.
It's focus.  Every opponent has a weak spot.  You ignore everything around you, and put all your energy into one perfect strike.
Who's Benjamin?
That was the name of Ricky Tan's boat.
Buddha is the symbol of luck and good fortune.
No.  I'm going to find out.
Try to keep them busy for five minutes.
MMMMMM!!!!
She's going home to New York.  I need some ice.
Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are you --
Excuse me?
No.  But I'll help you.
I'm fine.
I still have my lunch money from third grade.
Any leads?
The Secret Service?  Why?
Are you okay, Lee?
Did you tell Sterling?
Don't.
Ricky Tan?
I know, Master, but...
Heaven on Earth?  Master, I don't understand.  A temple, where Heaven is on Earth?  A mountain, where Earth reaches for the --
Chief Inspector Lee will brief your people...
Do I look like I'm movin'?!  What you're seeing here?  This is not movement. This is my "still".
The first drop will be made tomorrow. At twelve o'clock.  The amount will be fifty million.
In used currency.  Nothing bigger than a fifty.
Sir, I can explain.
Don't push it. You better watch your ass with these Fed types. If there's a screw-up, they won't think twice about burnin' it.
I didn't say I didn't.  You assumed I didn't.
Look, you want to work in this country, you gotta know this crap. Okay?  We're gonna be in some deep shit here.  Working the danger zone. And you need insurance.  Cause, you know, you might be starting some riots and shit.
I was being polite.
Witnesses.
It was not my intent --
I know a shortcut.
Don't go there...
Hey, everybody fits in here. Look at L.A., man.  Nobody's from here.  My momma's from Detroit, my dad's from Atlanta, they met in Texas, got married in Vegas and I was born in Alabama.  So where the hell am I from? Kenya?
Yes. He was part of the Juntao crime family. He may be Juntao himself.  And he dropped this.
Stooly.
Thank you. I learn a great deal.
Yeah, it's good.
I am sorry, but I have too much respect for women.
It ain't your ass, it's my ass you're backin' up.  Take the damn gun.
Oh yes.
Well, I ain't goin' to China.  And neither are you.
What?
FBI calls up my ass, says they need help in Tokyo.  Like I'm supposed to drop everything.
Where'd you get it?
The Feds?!
Well...listen, if you need any help, you know, back up, call me, OK?
Listen, this ain't about us! It's about a thirteen year old girl. She's not gonna make it. Unless we do something.
Alright, Johnson, thank you.  So...what are you wearing?
It's called a dress.
It's okay. For restaurants.
Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look like shit.
At this point we don't have much.
Sir, he's just gonna get in my way. If I'm gonna handle this situation...
You think this is funny, Carter?  You send for someone from Explosives!? Four men just died in there!
Ambassador Han.
You have run out of time.  The amount now is two hundred million.  I will call later with instructions.  You will either deliver the money or pick up the body of your daughter.
Take the money with you tonight. Pack it in six dragons. You will be contacted again.
Don't worry, he's with Carter.
I was trying to find the right time.
Ike just came by to check out the team.
I'm just bragging about how great you are.  I'm the luckiest man alive.
How about -- "I hope you'll be very happy together"?
Thank you.
I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be.  But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?
Could your confess to Father Patrick from now on?
Okay -- have a seat... gently, carefully.
Bob is making her visualize the ceremony.
Someone reliable, I'm sure.  A booze- hound in a bar?
But one of those guys -- not one of them -- knew her at all.  Each one was convinced that she was perfect for them, but they didn't see her.  And she never showed up so they couldn't see her. It's a very symbolic thing happening. She becomes what she thinks they wanted to be.
No.  No, you didn't.
Don't knock drunk guys in bars.  Drunk guys in bars are good.  It means they're not driving.
The real story on Miss Carpenter.
It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.
Order out like a Philistine, when you got the Galloping Gourmet here?...
Then you'll be my best man.
Splendid dissection of Maggie Carpenter, very professional job.
And end up in the papers?  I've been humiliated enough already to last a lifetime, thank you.  I'm sorry she got you canned.
Not yet.  I had a phlemless morning.  I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.
Thank you.
Originality is my speciality.
You can turn that finger around.
Seven-fifty.
I like it.  This whole thing is pretty incredible.  I think you could probably sell this lamp idea in New York.
You afraid to try?
Well, I'm impressed.  Absolutely incredible.  I didn't expect pink and lacy, but this isn't exactly a woman's room.
He's an entomologist!  I thought it was very unique.
Now that's romantic.  A proposal like that and you didn't find eternal bliss? What went wrong?
You don't know.
You know, there's no...
Excuse me?
And where you ever really going to run the leper colony in Molokai?
I'd rather not.
A little longer for me.
I don't know.  I, uh -- I frankly don't even want to talk about it.
Well, you do have the dress.
And the wedding date.  There's the two of us.  So, you think... maybe... You have to go down the aisle with somebody you love and who love you back.
I didn't.  And you being the one at the end of the aisle didn't just fix that.
For what reason?  Some personal satisfaction?
It's probably because you got him fired.
Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with Cory?
No, I don't think you're like, "I'm charming and mysterious in a way that even I don't understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you".  Very hard to compete with.  Especially to us married women who have lost our mystery.
Thanks.  Will you fix my hair?
Not this one.  This one's on me.
Good boy, Port Hole.
I changed it.  See you later, Mr. Travis.  That guy has a problem... Maggie, you can run everyone's life but your own.
No.  It's my life.
"And her ritual feast continues as she prepares to make a sacrifice out of the seventh fiance.  So all bets are on and we hope that this boomerang bride isn't honeymooning with Las Vegas odds makers because many predict that this girl is out of there before the race... before the rice hits the ground"  Holy moly.
No.
Is there somebody else?
That's good.
They're going to love you.
My head swells up like a watermelon and I drop dead.
I love you.
Happy New Year.
What is it?
Does it have wheat in it?
No.
It was my mother's.
So what happened?
Nothing's with me.
Actually, he sounded nice.
You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.
I know.
I couldn't do it.  How did I get here?
Becky?
Thank you.  I love you.
Well, it's the same woman.  And he was crazy about her.  What is this?  This is from Seattle.
M.F.E.O.?
It doesn't mean anything.  It was written before I went out there.  Before the ho.
No, I'm not. 
I want my money.
Hi, Jonah.  Sam.  And who is this?
What?
Yes, I did.
I know.  He's wonderful, isn't he?
How amazing.
Sure you do --
I'm not selling anything.  Your son called and asked for advice on how to find you a new wife.
Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America.
Have you had any relationship since?
It is easier to be killed by a terrorist --
Seventy... eight.
You think so?
I don't know.  Do I?
What is it?
What's the matter with this one? Wouldn't you like to have Imelda Marcos as your mother?
P.  Dad?
Stressed.
You have to give them your phone number or they won't let you go on the air.
I'm not going to think about what they're not teaching you in school.  I am not going to think about it.  Generally speaking I think we should rule out people who don't live somewhere near here --
English muffin.  How do you do it?
It doesn't.  They ask you.
What do you think?
What?
Go to sleep.
What was?
Good.
Now I'm late.  Bye.
Okay.
I was thirsty.
The water tastes better in the kitchen.
It's a short word.
Victoria? She's okay.
Get out.
No.
Hi.  Sam?
You must be Jonah.
Microwave.  Five minutes.
So whatdya say? I'll get the check, and I'll call you in eight months.
Why didn't you give a warning signal?
No thanks.
What do you mean -- sex equality?
An American.
Yes. We will light the candles.
Antonio paid for it.
Have mercy on this child ... let this child live ...
Over my dead body.
But it's yours. I won't let them ...
No.
Why not? I'm not needed here.
And you know why? Because the company knows they can starve us out -- even if it takes another two, three months. What's it to them if the mine's shut down a little longer?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Look who's talking! The Great White Father, and World's Champion of Women's Rights.
Then why's the company hanging tough? They've signed contracts with other locals -- why not this one?
Well, you're the organizer. You work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you're dead right. But when you figure everything the rank-and-file's to do down to the last detail, you don't give us anything to think about. You afraid we're too lazy to take initiative?
New York? You're not the Company President by any chance?
I thought maybe you forgot...
The what!
You've got to help around the house!
You Judas ... blood-sucker ...
Shhh.
The spiders.
Did you see his hair color?
I understand. Thanks anyway.
Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two.
Don't worry. He's out of town.
I try.
Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?
What about a battered woman's shelter? You can move you kid in with you.
Look, maybe you oughta' leave.
Why?
Twelve
You don't say.
Business.  I need to leave town and I find myself in dire need of some cash.
I think on account of his nose.
He doesn't have one.
Wait till I tell you what it is.
I can't tell you.
What does that mean?
Anything for a dear friend.
Why do you say that?
Hey, I was just trying to ...
I didn't fucking do anything! I swear to God!
Just some buddies.
It was all pretty informal.  Didn't have a lot of time to exchange pleasantries.
Hard to compare the people you're taking down with the Lord.
Garcetti thinks everything is shit. He doesn't even like dolphins.
It's not my place.
Just the way the world works.  Look, as far as tweakers go, you aren't a bad guy.  You never hurt anyone but yourself as far as I know.
When?
Cut the shit, Flynne.
For that old possession charge? Gimme a break.
News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.
I'm afraid so, Danny.
We got the 411 on your good old boy.
It speaks!
I still don't know what you're talking about.
Now that I can help you with. Nasty boy ... goes by the name of Pooh-Bear. He's a chef. Check with Palmdale P.D. I'm sure they're keeping box scores on the guy.
Lay off, Garcetti.  I'm not in the mood.
You mean the menacing red car?
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Yeah, I'd hate to shoot you by accident.
...alright, let me know when.
Fourty-four, twenty one dead.
I'm sending Simpson to take over for you, the division is going to Caen, you're not coming with us, I have something else for you.
Spit it out, Captain.
Thank you, sir.
Figured.
So they travel around from place to place and preach?
Shit, that was no big deal.
I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.
What deal?
Yes, sir.  It seems to me, sir, that the entire resources of the United States Army oughta be dedicated to one thing and one thing only, and that is to put me and this here weapon on a rooftop, smack-dab in the middle of Berlin, Germany.  Now I ain't one to question decisions made up on high, sir, but it seems to me that saving one private, no matter how grievous the losses of his family, is a waste of my God-given talent.
In the shadow by those two trees.
Gives Wade the second shot.
Don't that get kind of expensive, Cap'n?
To each, his own.
FORWARD!  FORWARD!  NOW REVERSE!
What do they know?  I had nine, but I feel through the ice when I was seven, my brother pulled me out.  Then I used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in Sicily, it was a dud.  I figure one on the beaches, one on the cliffs and two getting here.
Rolls his eyes, takes a breath. Scrambles into the gap.  The other five right behind.
You tryin' to get yourself killed?
Tell that to Private James Ryan. We've got our orders.  Let's go.
Three for three.
Now you're the one kidding yourself.  Hell of  a mission.
Is it getting worse?
How about I go right, sir?
How about you shut up and take your position?
Vecchio.
And what about your own hand?
It could be worse.  You know the first thing they teach you at O.C.S.? Lie to your men.
Simple, numbers.  Every time you kill one of your men, you tell yourself you just saved the lives of two, three, ten, a hundred others. We lost, what, thirty-one on the cliffs?  I'll bet we saved ten times that number by putting out those guns.  That's over three hundred men.  Maybe five hundred.  A thousand. Then thousand.  Any number you want. See?  It's simple.  It lets you always choose mission over men.
I think you're right, Keith.
Yes, sir.
Well, if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo, we might stand a chance, but not against those tanks.
We're going to hope like hell the tanks were on their way somewhere else.
Out of the mouth of babes.
Sure, meet me at the top, we'll start the paperwork.
Lingerie is my life, sir.  My mother's got a shop in Brooklyn, I grew up in it, from the time I could crawl, we carry Caen lingerie, it's the best there is, it's all I been thinking about since the invasion.
There's to be a bright side, look for it.
Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.
Sir, if you were not a captain, I would compliment you, now, for being an excellent liar.
Yes, sir, as a final note, I'd like to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle, fuck the cheese capital of France and while we're at it, fuck Private James Ryan.
We can't leave it here.
Let's hope, because we're sure as hell not going to do any damage to them with what we have here.
Get back to your positions!
I coach the baseball team, too.
Knows what that means.  He hears the RUMBLE OF THE TANKS.
Sir, if the Krauts are holding this bridge when division shows up, our guys are going to be sitting ducks.
I won't need to sir, it's already here, behind the barricade so...
...for you to blow up, yeah, yeah, we heard that.
Get lost.
It's easy, it runs in my family, take my grandfather, for example...
Don't let your father's business infect your life.
That's right.
Is it a gift for your wife?  Are you getting a set together? 
Excellent.
Listen, I don't know your name, but what are you doing for lunch?
He's a mess!
What's a scam?
See you tomorrow.
He wants to leave things on a good note.
Look at his face, he did the deed.
I dream about it.
Look, why don't you just call Diane again?
I'm not going back there.  I don't even know who you're talking about.
Oh yeah!
Now this is the only thing your mother ever gave me that I kept. Now it's yours.  Go ahead, open it.
Dad, I'm so glad I went.  Goodnight.
Diane, I'm not asking you to sever all relations with the boy. Give him a present, here, let him know you still care.  Give him this pen.
'I like him'?  Diane, I'm talking about being honest with people, being decent...
Swear to god.
You stole from them, you lied to me.  How do you think that's supposed to make me feel?
No, but you stole from them.
You let me believe you.  You knew you were guilty, and you let me become a part of it.  God, how... how could you...
Diane, I do have a history with this man, and it's not the greatest.  I see you so seldom, I'd really rather know about you.
Okay.  Oh, here's Ray.  Just talk to him because when you don't, your mouth turns down.
Yeah?
Thank you very much.
Yeah.  What a day.
Hmmm....
Y'know, you're not in England yet, you know that of course, and by the way, I want to just tell you that I lived in England for a few months,
They're Bavarian Death style  pretzels.
It's the worst job since keymaster.
Bye.
Today is tomorrow.
Come on.
I'll see you there.  Bye.
Be friends?
Yeah.
Right.
Oh.  I was putting the...
Your letter came yesterday.
No, we don't have to say it.
I know.  Lloyd, let's not start putting things on this level.
How can I look at you and say this?
What's wrong?
You need to study?
Okay, how much time do you need?  I mean, you know, I mean you'll be leaving in a little while, so that's answered some questions. 
Okay.  It's good knowing this.
Just my dad.
Don't be mean, this is hard for me too.
My father's guilty.  He lied to me, he lied to everybody.  I just left home... I need you.
I love you.
Your only mistake is that you didn't dump her first.  Diane Court is a showpony.  You need a stallion, my friend.  Walk with us and you walk tall.
Man, you're bringing me down!
Hook up the jab, hook up the jab.
Work that jab, work that hook, work that jab, okay, take a break, take a break.
Fine Lloyd.
Yeah.  Honey?
Are you?
It does, it does if it's the version signed 'I still can't help loving you'.  Read that.
So what's up?
How ya doin' Miss Evans?
What?
Yeah.
I called her up.
Alright.  Key?
You know Diane Court?
A very responsible young man you're out with tonight.
Yeah, alright.
I got a question.  If you guys know so much about women, how come you're here at like the Gas 'n' sip on a Saturday night completely alone, drinking beers, no women anywhere?
Itzhak Stern?  He's on the list.
Sir, the list is correct.
My plant manager is somewhere on this train. If it leaves with him on it, it'll disrupt production and the Armaments Board will want to know why.
I don't have to like her just because you do.  It doesn't work that way.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Some of the boys went crazy, what're you going to do?  You're right, it's bad business, but it's over with, it's done.  Occasionally, sure, okay, you got to make an example.  But that's good business.
True.
Well, you've been through it.  You know. You could make things easier for me.
He's important to my business.
What's going on?
It's good business.
I just told you.
All you have to do is tell me what it's worth to you.  What's a person worth to you.
You're welcome, I'm sure you're doing a great job.
That's great, thanks.
Nice things cost money.
So I'll talk to him about it.
Jews can no longer own businesses, sir, that's why this one's for sale.
Thank you.
Are you losing money?
There's nothing you can do.  I'm not asking you to do anything.  You came into my office.
I think it's too late.
Stern.
They're withholding payment.
There will be generations because of what you did.
He was a metal press operator, quite skilled.
There's taking money and there's taking money, you know that.  He's taking money.
The killer was trying to get to her. That sorority girl was a distraction.
37 usages of Himbry  located in the registar's office. 9 Tatum's, 47 Riley's. And that's just on campus. It's hopeless.
Attic, garage, basement, nothing.
That's smart.
What? I can't hear you...
Okay, okay. I'll call now. I'll call you back.
Who is this?
Why aren't you there?
Why would you wanna do that?
I'm inquisitive.
No, it's me.
Did you do it?
Cotton, I've done nothing but help you.
Tons and tons.
Enter Cotton Weary.
"And I hope life treats you kind and I hope you have all you dreamed of offffff. I wish you JOYYY."
I'm sorry honey. I got behind.
The forbidden subject.
So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
Damned if I know. She ditched me.
Aren't most serial killers seemingly harmless?
The way I see it. We’ll be arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on the home footage. Secure a book deal. If all goes as planned, our trial should coincide with the release of STAB II.
We’re hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING swan song exit planned.
How do you know my dim-witted inexperience isn't merely a subtle form of manipulation used to lower people's expectations thereby enhancing my ability to effectively maneuver within any given situation?
I also know that you're an aging TV reporter slash writer who, despite huge tabloid success, has some self worth issues regarding your personal life which directly effects your professional life in a non-positive manner. A coupla failed relationships with--I'm guessing balding, older men--have turned you into this bitch with a cell phone. But I bet sometimes, late at night, when you're all alone a sadness seeps to the surface and in a moment of clarity you know that all you really want is to be touched and held and fondled.
Meaning?
..and as lonely as I am...
Shit! It's both of them. The first murders were to throw us - using the same names as Woodsboro. But they've moved on- -they're getting closer to Sidney. They're not looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to kill. They're looking for the new Tatum.
There's nothing. I'm coming down.
They thought it was a publicity stunt.
They don't know. It was carefully planned. Earlier in the day the victims received anonymous passes to the movie.
No. I will not crawl under a rock. This is a fucked-up world and people kill people all the time. I'll just get used to it.
Just in case...
My morn was a Delta.
But who would operate your camera?
Oh my God.
Stay under the safety light. Help is on its way.
Gotta.
I've got my entourage. Take a break. Please.
No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.
It's not a good idea, Hallie.
Everyone in the theater is SCREAMING. Maureen tries her best to detach herself from the movie. She eats her popcorn.
Is that cool? Just to leave her like that?
Thanks, Joel.
Guys, guys, I'm sorry but, no way.
Ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere nickel a piece.
Gee, let me think. "Do you want to..." Is that the best you can do? Some tired hand me down rehash? Hey, pal, no one's gonna write a book about you. No movie rights. Nothing. I've been through this before and much better I might add.
But...
Anytime. Sorry it sucked. It just had that been there done that feeling.
Nah I think it's doing so damn well because one of it's players got iced. I just hope none of us end up dead.
Melinda McGraw?
Heh heh I bet they are babe. I bet they are. Look, my battery's dying . . .
Do I?
Thanks.
Very good. Now we play ROUND 2.
Closer than you think.
It may be Maureen Reynolds --
Horror flicks. B-Movies from Milton's heyday.
There's more.
Deal, but I'm still Detective Kincaid,ok?
Actually, there was more this time. This time, we found a picture too.
What did you know about your mother?
The killer called her.
He could've monitored the calls on a scanner. Did you call her from the set?
Sid I can see you!
This has everything to do with me Dewey. I was the one who brought the nation's attention to this shit anyway. I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit around and pass on the buck again.
Again, I am the author of the definitive book on the Woodsboro murders.!  What about you?
Always.
Someone stole Sid's file?
And who is that?
Who is it?
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.
I know right. It was kinda weak. That's cause Will Kennison only wrote a rough treatment of it. The script was written by some new guy. He wrote Arlington Street.
Oh shit it's my cell!
No! He's not dead! He's still breathing! Look!
Settle down Beavis.  Why don't you tell us the truth?
Oh come on! Why the hostility?
Who?
Now you listen to me, Lois Lane, let it go. It's dead and buried. Daddy took ol' Yeller out behind the barn and shot him in the head a long time ago.
Hi, Gale. I'm glad you're all right.
Oh, you know, the usual small talk, "What's new, how ya been, how do you want to die?"
All the nightmares. All the hell I went through was because of you, you spineless bastard!
Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun. You haven't seen the best part.  With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've been able to steal your voice.  Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna find next to your lifeless, mutilated body.
Roman that's not the line.
I'm just saying, though. What if there's someone out there stalking actors? Huh? Then what?
Yes.
I don't want them, I want you!  It's simple. You show yourself, they survive, you run, they die!
It's good to see you again Sidney. I was growing real impatient. Go ahead. Explore. I'll catch up with you later.
Well then the people you need to call are the police.
Yeah...
Get the gun. I'll untie Pops.
She looked dead. Still does.
You sleep in THAT?
Oh it did?
See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?
Understand what? That I got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me.
Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy?
When are you gonna let that go, Sid? When my mom left my dad -- I just accepted it. This is the way it is. She's not coming back.
You have to move on, Sid.
Oh Sidney...
Sure it is, Sid. It's all a movie. Life's one great big movie. Only you can't pick your genre.
I called my dad.
You don't still think it was me?
Fuck you.
Who is this?
What number is this?
I don't know.
Why don't you want to talk to me?
What's that noise?
I want to now who I'm talking to.
What do you think I said?
I told you not to hang up on me.
I thought you didn't have a boyfriend.
His name wouldn't be Steve, would it?
Go to the back door and turn on the porch light -- again.
Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.
Come on, yes you do.
YES!
It was Jason. I saw that goddamned movie twenty times. It was Jason.
You are precious. Please, call me Gale.
I don't think you're so bad.
...yeah...
Afraid not.
Have to be. The shit she's gone through.
What about the cellular phone bill?
The phone's dead.
Forget it.
During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar.
He's lying. She wouldn't have touched him. He raped her, then butchered her. Her blood was all over his coat.
Why would she lie about it?
So where are you?
Right here.
Hello Sidney.
Who are you?
Can you knock?
No you didn't.
Got it.
Yeah, Casey and Steve were completely hollowed out. Takes a man to do something like that.
There's always some stupid bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend. That's the beauty of it all. Simplicity. Besides, if it's too complicated you lose your target audience.
Could be. Now that Billy's tried to mutilate her, you think Sid would go out with me?
I had 'em hid in the foreign section.
He came to make up.
Don't listen to him. It's him. He's the one.
No, Sid.
Are you serious?
You guys can go up to my parents room? To talk and... whatever.
What happened?
No way.
Do they know who did it?
They think it's school-related?
Later.
Whatever. Just hurry.
It's alright. I'll get it.
If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn't prove it in court?
Created by that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.
Don't go there, Sid. You're starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick. Don't freak yourself out -- we've got a long night ahead of us.
Oh, god...
You have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother's untimely death. It's no big deal. You'll thaw out.
With Stu, there's little time to stop and reflect. But sometimes before, to relax and get in the mood, I think about Grant Goodeve.
I don't know, they just did.
That is so sexist. The killer could easily be female -- BASIC INSTINCT.
I did. He's full of shit.
Where you guys been? We had to start without you.
What about the trace on his bank account and the guns?  There must be something to connect him with a past.
Announcing what?
No, I haven't heard.
He's not finished.
Where was the girl?
Who tied her down?  You or him?
Her pretty head.
Wanting people to pay attention, you can't just tap them on the shoulder.  You have to hit them in the head with a sledgehammer. Then, you have their strict attention.
Not me.  I'm not special.  I'm not exceptional.  This is, though.  What I'm doing.
You only killed a bunch of innocent people so you could get your rocks off.  That's all.
What the fuck is going on here?!
All this effort you've made to get transferred, it's the first question that pops into my head.
I realize that.
What?
Is there any blood in it?
Good.
This was one sadistic motherfucker.
Can we talk about this in private?
Hello.
I'm certain.  He was the biggest defense lawyer around.  Infamous, actually.
Right.  But there, pride comes first, not gluttony.  The sins are in a different order.
I know.
Okay.  But, what?
We're screwed.  He's fucking with us.
Bear with me.
No.
Oh, that's all.
I've seen the same.  I'm not the country hick you seem to think I am.
He doesn't have the desire somehow.  Our killer seems to have more purpose.  More purpose than Victor could ever conceive of.
I expected it to be bad, you know.  I took a human life... but I slept like a baby that night.  I never gave it a second thought.
No kidding!  No fucking kidding!
A landlord's dream tenant: a paralyzed man with no tongue.
It's too dismissive to call him a lunatic. We can't make that mistake.
No.  He's not depending on luck.  You've seen that.  We walked into that apartment exactly one year after he first tied Victor to the bed, to the day.  To the day! Because he wanted us to.
I don't know... like fifty.
Yeah, well... at least we're out of the office.  We've got pizza.
We're focusing.
That is.
It was him.
If we get him, I'll be happy enough.
I'm requesting you keep me on as your partner a few more days.  You'd be doing me the favor.
Big surprise.
Kiss me on the lips.
I don't know why... why now?
High school and college, yes.  Pretty hokey, huh?  I knew on our first date this was the man I was going to marry.  God... he was the funniest man I'd ever met.
It surprises me.  It really does.
You have to put blinders on sometimes. Most times.
Talk to him about it.  He'll understand if you tell him how you feel.
You should look into private schools.
I hate this city.
How should I know?
It just happened to be me...No need to make any more of it...
An' she's got a beau! Kisses him, too!
What, Ben?
Why don't you finish the job?
What right you got to be talkin' marriage to any decent woman...
I ain't wearing no gun.
This 'un come a long way 'fore he died.
There sure is! I'm going to tell you somethin'...I wasn't going to speak of it...But I'll tell you now. Did you notice them scalps strung on Scar's lance?  Did you see the third scalp from the point of the lance? Long... wavy hair...
Swear it, Ethan?...Given word?
You got it with you?
In that case you won't find her -- and I won't get my thousand dollars.
Get some sleep...Tomorrow's another day...
No...our turnin' back don't change anything...not in the long run. If she's alive, she's safe...for a while...They'll keep her to raise as one of their own, 'til she's of an age to...
I ain't stayin'...I set out lookin' for Debbie...I aim to keep on...
Yeah...you want me to know I ain't got no kin -- no money -- no horses -- nothing but a dead man's clothes to wear!..You tole me that already... Now shut your head!
Maybe I'm gettin' like Mose Harper -- my bones is cold tonight...
What?
Look?
Yeah, I kinda figgered you'd say that...Bein' a new husband and all...
What'd the soldiers have to kill her for!..
Never heard of him...
He's got to...All these years, run- nin', dodgin', knowin' we were after him...Now we caught up...It's him or us.
You don't remember it, but I remember. That was your mother's scalp!
There's one thing. We recovered a bushel of trinkets in that camp... cheap stuff...trade goods...Couldn't help noticing that most of it was Mexican...Maybe if you could talk to some of those Mexican traders along the border...What do they call themselves?
That means Mister Futterman is dead, by golly.
Ain't worth the mendin'...
I can't help it, Laurie...I just gotta catch up with Ethan...
No, it wasn't...You mighta said you loved me...You mighta asked me to wait...At least that'd have been something...
Oh, that was upstairs.  A real antiquity!  I think it's great.
We're probably lucky that we even have running water and electricity! Damned box!
Oh, damnit!
We'll call for someone from town first thing in the morning.
Making our very own solstice fire.
And two months later, we got married.  And all because of one sentence:  "With you, my life began and with you shall it end..."
Come on, at least try one.  It took me two hours to make these.
No, thanks.  I have everything I need.  Drive safely, you hear?
Damn it, look at you!  Don't you see what's happening with you?  We need to get out of here, don't you understand?  Out of this house!
We loved each other once.  Have you forgotten that?
I wouldn't have made it by myself.
Oh no, no.  You're not bothering him.  He has lots of time since he's been retired.
Thank you.  Elisabeth, I didn't mean to...
I wonder how you guys figure on renovating this whole place.  You can afford to spend some money.  If I was you, I'd spare myself all the hard work.  Besides, didn't you want to start writing again?
Not so bad, if I could get some peace and quiet around here.
No Juliet?!
I am still owed money for this play, Burbage.
Romeo
Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift.
Nothing comes.
The woman who wears the snake will dream of you, and your gift will return. Words will flow like a river. I will see you in a week.
Who is that?
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.
Mr. Fennyman, let me explain about the theatre business.  The natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster. Believe me, to be close by the plague is a bagatelle in the ups and downs of owning a theatre.
Nothing. Strangely enough , it all turns out well.
I don't know. It's a mystery.
Very well.
Every word.
Doubt that the stars are fire, doubt that the sun doth move
What piece? Richard Crookback?
I did not.
God's teeth, am I to suffer this constant stream of interruption?!  What will you do in Act Two when he meets the love of his life?
By God, Will, if you do not, who does? Let us have pirates, clowns, and a happy ending, or we will send you back to Stratford to your wife!
What do we do now?
Go on.
How will it?
Well, there's a pirate  In truth, I have not written a word.
Do you think?
Mercutio…good name.
I thought your play was for Burbage.
A different one you haven't written?
"Ay me, sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?"
Be patient, my lord, she is dressing.
I will.
When the Queen commands it.
I am not so well-born.
Verona again.
"Madam!"
"Ay pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer."
"Ay me."
I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes; And but thou love me, let them find me here.
I like her.
You have opened the playhouses?
I am Ethel, sir, the Pirate's daughter.
What will you have me do? Marry you instead?
You cannot, Wessex will kill you
My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes, and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife come from Stratford to tell you that. And yet you let me come to your bed.
"Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day> It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, love, it was the nightingale."
"I have more care to stay than will to go. Come death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let's talk. It is not day."
and thus unable to declare her love
My lord.
I do not love you, my lord.
Virginia?!
But why me?
Lady Viola is…young in the world. Your Majesty is wise in it. Nature and truth are the very enemies of playacting. I'll wager my fortune.
It is not my riding day, my lord.
It is to be expected on a Sunday.
My hat?
I . . .
Do you understand me?
Constantly. Without doubt. And plays the lute, she has a natural ear. And her bosom--did I mention her bosom?
Serve.
Victory is the same as defeat. It's giving in to destructive competitive urges.
I don't have time to discuss it now. I don't care so long as he's not a freak.
Can I show you something?
All right, then, go ahead, telephone. Telephone the police. Try again. No one's going to stand in your way. Go ahead. Tell them there's a suitcase of money and you don't want it.
You call them if you want.
Dig the pit, I don't know.
Just stop worrying.
Now.
Anyway, what I was wanting to say was this --
You think so?
I don't know.
I fitted a lock up there. On the inside.
You're sure? There's lots more.
What's wrong?
It doesn't neccessarily matter. They don't even know who those people are, and even if they did, they have nothing to connect them with us, nothing at all.
Cover it?
This is just an informal discussion.
Well, then?
And if I told you their car was parked outside, would that surprise you?
No, not any more. I just wondered if it would surprise you.
That's all?
Yes, thanks.
I mean, what are you actually doing here? What is the hidden agenda?
She hated you --
What? Oh, yeah, sure, if you want. I tell you, every letter this guy writes to you is the same: they all begin like pure love and descend into open pornography. I dream of your thighs, the soft touch of your white skin leading me in desire, while I, aroused and inflamed --'
Not usually this drunk.
-- which is a hack.
So I gathered.
So what's wrong with that?
Yes.
Did what?
Is that all?
And now you tell me.
For ever and ever.
It's not for me. It's for love and happiness forever.
It tastes different.
Your painful groin?
Oh, good.
Forget it -- he'll come down.
Everything.
As smart as you are, you'll need a little help.
Don't worry about it. I'd do exactly the same, but I don't think I'm his type.
I see.
What?
You mean I can have the room?
Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
That wasn't a question.
OK, I'm going to play you just a few seconds of this tape -- I'd like you to name the song, the lead singer and the three hit singles subsequently recorded by him with another band.
Keep it going, Alex. You're unstoppable now.
Two hundred pounds?
What?
No one. I promise.
Oh, don't be so coy, dear. You're going to Rio.
Exactly what I was --
I'm not sure --
Yes, sir.
That guy, the one that died.
That's what I thought.
A priest who dies.
The telephone? It continues to ring.
A certain weakness.
One other thing. Do you have any tattoos?
Is it real?
Yeah, baby. Things are great. Listen, there's Devra, whatta you want?
It's just -- fabulous.  Think you could do anything for me?
-- yes, we're all trying to do something to make this a better country to live in, believe it or not.
My keys.
Listen, baby, don't leave, really.
Gee, that's very serious...
I don't want to see you anymore.
I'll have Mary wash you. Mary!
Whatever you say.
The shop. I think you're a good investment, and I don't mind telling him.
I mean it or I wouldn't say it.
No.
I guess so.
Okay.
Yeah.
Hungry?
I do her hair, yeah.
No thanks.
What would my being a faggot have to do with that?
Have you ever made it with a girl?
You think that's funny, don't you?
I am not like my mother!
I am not!
Look...  Do you wanna fuck me?
Right.
Great.
Right.
Well, I do Barbara Rush.
Yeah.
-- Yeah... your car down here?
-- Maybe she'll come with us. If I tell her how important it is to me, I don't think she'll mind. Do you?
You going to tell him?
Probably the bathroom.
No, I'm sure.
Okay.
... he tried to... uh... make it with me.
What?
Yeah?
Yeah, baby...
-- we can't now.
I am you, you little bastard.
He never stopped.
-- oh I thought you were --
Look who's talking.
Lester's on his way.
Look -- either you leave or I leave because I don't want the two of us here when Lester arrives. I just don't --
That's it, then I'm leaving.
What for?
If I have to touch her again, I'll throw up!
-- Oh yeah.
-- c'mon, I'll get you home...
Hey, baby, what's happening?
I don't have your number, stop by the shop.
Who?
Nobody's gonna get you but me!
How?
I am?
We live together now.
Of course I like children.
What!
How did it go at the bank?
I said I wasn't sure if I could go.
Hey, baby, say hello to Felicia.
About what?
Your advice!
I'll call you.
Nothing, I'll call you, okay?
What do you mean, what is it? It's some political bullshit.
Ha, ha.
-- go ahead.
I don't want to fight either. Look... uh -- I love you.
I'll know you've lied to me... all along. I'll know you're incapable of... love... that'll help me... not now, but eventually.
Jesus.
That's all you've got to say?
But Mr. Norman said --
After a while that hurts... doesn't it?
They're not?
You're right.
Yeah, little election party I'm giving at the Bistro. It's a pain in the ass but -- I have to do it. We'll have a little time to talk there.
It's nerve wracking sometimes... women can get you very upset.
Isn't that bad for it?
Well... who are those guys?
What can I say!
What, do you think I planned it?
Oh, are you kidding, man? She hates her.
What?
I... uh... I... uh... can't.
That's very sweet of you, Mr. Roth.
Is that right?
George is going to open a shop.
Fine.
Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope.
Jesus, she's my best friend.
So what's your point?
George is great but I know what you mean.
I guess not.
Don't be silly.
Well, it's George.
-- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.
Well, you know what I mean.
Well yes -- you know that about George.
-- When you say forty-five minutes or an hour, do you mean continuous time? Just continually, without stopping?
Now I'm embarrassed to tell you.
Is he an enemy?
-- sort of a boyfriend?
-- never mind.
I don't think so.
Two weeks from tomorrow.
Jill.
Gee... that's wonderful, Jill.
No.
Do you like this hotel?
What do you mean?
Yes, Dad.
Yeah.
How does he tell you things?
Now think real hard, Doc.  Think.
You're scared of Room 237, ain'tcha?
Okay.
Yeah.
No.
Yes?
Danny... what's the matter, hon?
Are you having a bad dream?
Danny, come here!
Oh!
No.
Why not?
Does Tony ever tell you to do things?
Do I have to?
Thank you.
Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, he seems absolutely fine now, but you should have seen him.
Only about three months.  Eh we're from Vermont.  My husband was teaching school there.
Well how can I repay you?
Why no, sir.  I don't believe so.
He is, Mr. Torrance.
Will you indeed, Mr. Torrance.
There's nothing I look forward to with the greater pleasure, Mr. Grady.
It will be a pleasure.  Right this way Mrs. Torrance.
Yeah.  We call him Doc sometimes, you know, like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.  But how did you know that?
Well this ought to be quite a change for you.
I guess we've been staying up too late.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes, I did.
Good.
Jack...
You think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
Jack...
Wendy!
I'm not going to hurt you.
Wendy give me the bat.
Give me the bat.
Go away.
Go away.
Oh, no problem at all.  I made the trip in three and a half hours.
Well, if you are going to have some, I wouldn't mind.  Thanks.
Well, that sounds fine to me.
Not for me.
Damn near. Now I'll sit up with this stupid gun in my lap because I promised, but you two are going to bed. Go on, now, scoot.
Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I couldn't stop him.
It was Brady's idea, Jane. Honest to God. Please take the money. I want to make up.
What do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed?
What's that?
For getting a divorce?
Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?
No.
She and dad are out back lighting the barbecue. Jane's walking around like she's King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always.
It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.
I don't get you.
A tracer. You'll like it.
What the hell does that matter?
You're not going to let it go, are you?
Marty, the moon wasn't even full!
The kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a Jesuit. A French Jesuit.
Well... thank you.
Really?
Yeah, you learned a whole lot, I can tell.
Well... because it's in the Bible. "Thou shalt not..."  Thou shalt not.
You can handle this.
You did what?
You want me to go against a priest?  Get excommunicated?  You think I'm nuts?
We can still see each other.  Just like always.  It's a different kind of sin. Smaller.
I am sorry for all my sins.  And yours.
Oh-huh.
What is it, Betty?
Just about.  Show me again.
No way.  We're a choir, right? Headliners.  The big room.  Two days a week won't cut it.  Every day.
That man -- who is he?
This is so exhilarating!  All week long, I can't wait till Sunday, when we sing.
Enough jabber.
Progressive convents.  Vanity.  It sounds awful.  It sounds just like this place.
Experience!  Right?
Keep moving!
I don't know, some people just don't like nuns.  I wish I had a ruler.
Mary Robert, I've watched you.  You never really sing.  You whisper. Nothing comes out.
She's got nothing to do with this.  Let her go.
What is your full name?  Your Christian name?
What?
What?
Can do.
Normally dressed, you are a sore thumb, and you endanger us all.  While you are here, you will conduct yourself as a nun. Only I shall know who, and what, you truly are.  You will not disrupt the convent.  You will not influence the Sisters with your colorful street talk. You will draw no attention to yourself in any way.
As of now, and until you leave, you are Sister Mary Clarence.
I'm outta here.
A what?
My what?
Your cell is more than adequate.
You are correct.  Sometimes prayer alone cannot help a situation.  Such as your own, for example.  How do you feel about physical labor?
Good.  Mary Patrick, I need you in the office.  Mary Clarence, carry on.
I don't believe we have anything to say to each other.
But you can't kick me out!  Guys want to kill me!  You're a nun!  A big nun! Aren't you supposed to have compassion? For the wayward sheep?  I mean, I'm a major sinner!  All-time great!  Hall of Fame!  Aren't I, like, your dream come true?  Your Olympic event?
I am?
Through blasphemy?  You have corrupted the entire choir!
And I am refusing.  As of tomorrow, Mary Lazarus will resume her leadership of the choir.
Of course.  Mary Clarence, a convent is not a totalitarian state.  Most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole.  A membership that, I am certain, will vote in a rational and pious manner. All those in favor of allowing Mary Clarence to select a program?
You have a phone call.
Okay, so I just got things started.  But you could build on that.  You could keep it going.
Very well.  I hold you responsible for all of this, For introducing a lounge act into my convent.  For utterly disrupting our way of life.  And for placing all of us in mortal danger.  Thank-you.
Maybe Hawaii.
Calm down.  Look, I didn't want to tell you this, but we've had some problems with our protection program lately.
Keeping our witnesses alive.  We hide them, but there's a leak in the department, and they end up dead.
What if I was Vince?  You'd be dead right now.  What are you doing giving interviews on TV?
You're supposed to be hiding out!
Jesus, look at you   You're glowing.
What?
I think they'd understand.
Really.
We didn't tell you what?
Take care of it.
It's a bluff, Vince.
So, take it off.
Maybe pants.
No smart-ass remarks or nothing.
And then we can ice her.  No nun, no evil eye.
Reverend Mother, on behalf of the sisters, I'd like to welcome Mary Clarence to St. Katherine's.
All right.  It's a beginning.  Las Vegas, Nevada.
That was exciting!
Maybe we can get some of the local kids to sing with us.
It's no use.  She just isn't here.
We'll pray -- and she'll be there.
Yes -- two men -- and they had guns.
A Benedictine.
Christy.
Yes?
And you'll face that danger head-on.  As if I could stop you.  And you have my complete support in this matter. Anything you can do to revitalize this neighborhood would be a blessing.
It's that call you were expecting, Vince.
I love you, Chris.  I always will.  I gave you so much.  My time.  My affection.  A big-time career.  And how do you repay me?  What's the thanks I get?  Where's the loyalty, huh?  Where's the love?
Find 'em!
Many have.
You are the blacksmith.  Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?
Two days... ?  For murder?
What is that?
I do not care.  You are welcome to use my work area, but I beg you... return her to her resting place.
You will stay at her side?
What of it?
Master Hardenbrook...
I shall, gladly.
Van Ripper and his wife agreed to take him.  They have children and a good home and good land.
Is that all you say?  Look at her.
I know it.
Listen.
No crickets or cicadas calling.  No bird songs.
"Let loose his silent shrieking." Who knows, till we work at it?  I admit not being anxious to find out.  "He who holds the Horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand." Whatever the Horseman's desire is, other than extinguishing lives.
What does it mean?
Something I really wish I had not seen. Never mind it.  Did you find the victims' loan agreements?
It is nothing.  She comes to read books, so her father will not find her.  It is absolutely nothing.
I doubt that's the end.
Tired.
Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds?
You made this, and the drawings?
If you want.  But...
You are not regarding it in full. The Widow Windsor had been run through by a sword.  I followed the bloodless wound, a wound whose path I could not comprehend till I had seen the Horseman with my own eyes.
To avenge his father, and the others.
What?
What did you say?
Just... keep where you are.
He moves too fast.
His horse.
It is a prime tenet of science, Philipse, that because one thing appears improbable does not mean you embrace the utterly fantastical.
Yes, actually.
Look closer.  Do you have anything to clean it with?
You are from the Hollow?
Doctor, he is awake.
Father saw you die.
No, sir, please... she is innocent...
You got any money?
Well, I'm gonna pay you today for this comin' week, so you'll have some walkin' around money. When you get off this evenin' you better go buy some toothpaste and cleanin' up supplies to have back there. Some hard candy and some magazines. Somethin' to keep you busy at night.
I fixed it. Hit's a workin' pretty good.
See there. Thinks of the simplest thing first.
How are you, Bill?
What do you like to eat here?
Ain't you got no mama and daddy to tend to it?
They was a boy. We made friends.
It's too big.
Yeah She was a big 'un. You ain't drunk drivin' are you Doyle?
Ain't that the sweetest thing. What am I supposed to do about supper with you traipsin' around with that fag?
Karl, you better clap your hands or he'll just keep on.
You know what I told you, you even think of leavin' me, I'll kill you dead as a doornail.
Don't tell me what to do.
Don't tell me what to do.
Would y'all like that?
Naw, hell, let them stay here with me and do men things. There might be some kind of ball game on we can watch. You go on.
You might want to find out. He might of hacked his family to pieces with a hatchet or somethin'.
Don't talk about daddy. Y'all go on to the garage and let me be.
Don't rush ever'body, honey.
That's ridiculous. That's just a total lie.
Come on, don't be a pussy. Everybody has to work.
Oh, yeah, I'm thrilled.
It's not your house, Doyle, it's Linda's.
This and that. Toothpaste and whatnot.
A good deal of it, I reckon. Can't understand all of it.
How does a feller go about gettin' ahold of the police?
I wanted to bring you some flowers. They're pretty good ones.
Here give me the flowers, I'll do something with them. Thank you. Now you better go. Maybe I'll see you down at the secret place one day in a week or two or something. I have a boyfriend now you know. And we're pretty serious. He gave me a ring.
I reckon I feel all right.
Yeah it is. Your name's Frank.
How come her to keep bein' girlfriends and all with him if he's mean to her?
Why did he do that, reckon.
I thought they was.
He ort not to talk that away to you neither. He ain't no count. He's mean to you and your mama.  Yore mama and that feller that's carryin' me to get somethin' d'eat's gonna be back here directly.
I reckon if you want me to.  I got some of that potted meat and sodie crackers left over if you want some.
I like the way you talk.
All right then.
They ort to. You're a good boy.
Yes sir. You ort not know that language.
My daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin' in it. I went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see 'cause they was a noise and somethin' movin' in it. Hit was bloody-like around that towel. Hit was a little ol' bitty baby, no bigger than a squirrel.
I reckon.
Readin' on this book on how to work carpentry. I aim to learn how to build things out of wood one of these times. I've always been partial to wood buildin's and cabinets and whatnot. These drawin's they got here don't make no sense to me so far.  You seem like yore tails a'draggin' a might. You got somethin' wrong with ye?
You will? For sure?
I'm glad of it you was borned.  I reckon I ain't gonna be there in the garage no more.
That feller's a whole sight meaner than me. He'd just whup the tar out of me.
Okay.
I don't know. He just said he'd eat out there.
They ain't even no good. The only one can play is Randy Horsefeathers. He claims he's an Indian. His real name's Randy Collins and he works at the feed mill. He can at least play guitar.
He ain't ever okay to me.
No, honey, we don't.  I'll make some coffee and start cleanin' up this mess. Karl, you want some coffee, huh?
Did Vaughan go home?
Did Karl go to bed?
I bet he don't. Karl likes me.
Mama?
I ain't really thought about it too much I don't reckon.
Yeah.
Naw.
I reckon.
Yes sir.
Yes sir.
Right now?
Well, it is nearly breakfast time anyway. I can't go to sleep. I have to be at work in three hours. You know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two, you feel worse than if you hadn't slept at all?
Vaughan's "friend" will be there, too. He works at the funeral home. And Frank. You know Frank likes you a lot. He says you make him feel calm.
I's horned and raised here up till I's twelve year old.
I ain't a-stayin'. I need to ast you fer a favor.
In a few minutes we're gonna be in a room with a killer. That doesn't bother you?
No, we have to get this story.
Nice to meet you. I'm Marsha Dwiggins and this is Theresa Evans. She's here to take the pictures.
Well, what do we do? We drove all the way out here.
Before they were married?
I think everybody at the store knows that already. They always talk about it. Maureen Ledbetter told a awful story about why you ain't allowed over at the First Baptist Church no more.
Actually, I'm his father.
Better make it charge. 
Until she was twelve. She moved here in 'forty-nine.
It's just a summer job. Something to help pay the bills while I finish my dissertation.
Of course I fool around. But not so much when it comes to my work, it's true.  Have you ever read Pierre, or the Ambiguities?
I'll tell you all about it...  ... but not here.
For me?  I'll have the same thing. 
What's that, Sol?
I wouldn't think of it.  See you around, fellas.
It's mine all right. I've owned that little sucker for a long time.
That's what people see, but that ain't necessarily what I am.
It's Ellen. Look at her. Look at my sweet darling.
This is April Lee, Auggie. April, say hello to Auggie Wren.
It's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little.
Hey, kid. You interested in a job? I just got word from your employment agency that you're looking for a position in retail sales.
He's crazy.
Cops? You mean they nabbed those cruds?
Fuckus my assus. They did some number on you.
Nothing much. He said his socks and underpants were dirty, and would we mind driving up with his things.  Fucking kids, huh? They take you for granted every time.
We'd better be. I haven't spent a night out of Brooklyn in fourteen years, and I'm not about to break my record now. Besides, I've got to be on my corner at eight sharp tomorrow morning.
Okay.  You remember how you once asked me how I started taking pictures? Well, this is the story of how I got my first camera. As a matter of fact, it's the only camera I've ever had. Are you following me so far?
Eighteen and a half years.
This is private, Auggie. Just between you and I.
I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.
And that's how Felicity came into the picture. During one of those two seconds.
Look, I'm not saying you don't have a daughter. It's just that she's not my daughter.
Cut it out. Just cut it out, okay? It's starting to get on my nerves.
You told me you wanted to meet him. Well,here he is.
I don't have much choice, do I? It's pretty clear she doesn't want me around.
I'm sorry, baby. I can't help it.
Ruby McNutt. My one true love.
She made a play for me after I got back, but her glass eye kept interfering with my concentration. Every time we got into a clinch, I'd start thinking about that hole in her head, that empty socket with the glass eye in it. An eye that couldn't see, an eye that couldn't shed any tears. The minute I started thinking about it, Mr. Johnson would get all soft and small. And I can't see getting married if Mr. Johnson isn't going to be in tiptop shape.
You're a dumb, whacked-out little fuck, do you know that?
What difference does it make?
And these?
I think I'll take them. 
The damn lock's broken again.  And so you just barge in on strangers, is that what you do? Is that your game?
Thomas? Who's Thomas?
Well, whatever his name is, he's not here anymore. He left two days ago, and I haven't heard from him since.
That's what he said. He told me he lived with his mother and father on East Seventy-fourth Street.
It's a free country, isn't it? As long as I'm not trespassing on your property. I can stay here till kingdom come.
I'm not going to rob you, mister.  Do I look like a thief?
You know, health insurance, dental plan, paid vacation. It's not fun being exploited. Workers have to stand up for their rights.
I don't know. I try. Every day I keep on trying, but it's no easy task for a man to change his nature.  I'm off the booze, though. Haven't had a drop in six years. And now I've got me a wife. Doreen. Best damned woman I've ever known.  And a little boy, too. Cyrus Junior.  So things have definitely improved since I got fitted with this hook. If I can just turn this goddamn garage around, I'll be in pretty good shape.
Help? What the fuck do I need your help for? I've got a man, don't I? That's more than you can say for yourself, Hawkeye.
Baby? And what baby is that?
An abortion, stupid.  I had an abortion the day before yesterday. So you don't have to bug me about that shit anymore.  Bye-bye, baby!
I used to smoke Raleigh cigarettes. They came with a free gift coupon in every pack.
Huh?
I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm walking around in a fog ...
Yes it is. It's a law of the universe. If I let you walk away, the moon will spin out of orbit ... pestilence will reign over the city for a hundred years.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but I might be able to help.
Do you need some money? Some extra clothes?
Take good care of yourself, okay?
Maybe. Or maybe it's the other people who don't belong.
What time did you get to bed last night?
The inspiration.
Excuse me for asking, but you aren't married, are you?
Nice try. You had me going for a second, but no ... no writer would ever do a thing like that.  Would he?
Is it yours?
No way. There's no way I'm giving that money back. It's my money now.
I suppose so. He never told me about it.
What are you talking about?  You can't be serious.
Wow. They sure did a job on you.
It's all right. I really do know them.
Hot coffee or iced coffee?
If you're lucky.  Then again, it depends on what you call living. 
No, but as I say, the type is rare. Ten percent of Caucasian males.
You don't.
Well.  Every time I see him in town or somewhere, he's starin' at me with these narrow eyes. Givin' me his mean face.
Unwritten rule of the sea.  We don't bother each other, stick to ourselves. Ask anybody.
All right, what if the defendant <u>heard</u>?  So Carl <u>let</u> him aboard, to help.  And <u>then</u> the fishing gaff?
Why not?
At school, she kept mostly to the Japanese kids, and sort of ignored me.  As if all of our times alone together...in the hollow cedar, everywhere...were a secret.
Your friends would.  Your dad would kill me with a machete.
Well, I don't do it for just anybody.
I'm sorry about your arm.  Kabuo and I.  Are very sor...
There's no one here, and I've <u>got</u> to talk to you.
You've been busy with that trial, I suppose.  Such a travesty...
Oh, in a heartbeat.
Nossir.  I'd gone to tell the wid... to tell Mrs. Heine.
Objection!  Speculation.
I'm sorry, was there a question in there?
Well, 'initially' is an interesting word, sir.  You'd <u>been</u> arrested, you <u>had</u> a lawyer, and you <u>still</u> claimed ignorance!
Some seaman's loast report. Stuffed in a cabinet, good as lost forever.  No one knows.
Won't take two.
To my father.  Everything counts.
Maybe...?
The knife.  What knife?
Your daddy played.  I asked, down at the Japanese Community Center. You smoke cigars?
Sure.  I could take a fishing gaff and split your head open. Right above your left ear.
I want you.  To tell the truth.
I don't think so.
She's alright, Nels, thanks for asking.
Meaning that he wasn't murdered first, say on the deck of the boat, and then thrown overboard.
I wouldn't say encouraged.
I can't speak for him.
As I said, in every way.  Physically and psychologically.  More endurance, quicker responses, better hand-eye, improved technical training.  Where the First Psychology gave you ninety-eight percent obedience, this bunch gives you 99.4.
Bull fiddle.

Those two musicians from the garage!
Look at those odds - ten to one. If he wins, we can pay everybody.
What are you worried about?  This job is going to last a long time.
Jerry-boy - why do you have to paint everything so black? Suppose you get hit by a truck? Suppose the stock market crashes?
Quiet - I'm thinking.
Look, stupid, he's ten to one.  Tomorrow, we'll have twenty overcoats!
I thought you weren't talking to me.
- Type O.
But, Joe - three weeks in Florida!  We could borrow some clothes from the girls in the chorus -
It's twelve bucks.  We can get one of the overcoats out of hock.
They got the bull-fiddle.
Not yet.  But if those guys catch us, there'll be blood all over.  Type O.
Watch it, Daphne!
Now you've done it!
You tore it again!
I'm a girl.  I'm a girl.  I'm a girl -
Good night, Josephine.
I got pinched in the elevator.
Yeah?  Well, I'm your fairy godmother - and I'm keeping an eye on you.
You got it made, kid.  Fielding wants you to have a little cold pheasant with him on his yacht -
He's going to be ashore with you.
Don't give me the musketeers!  How'm I going to keep the guy ashore?
I'm engaged.
Look, stop treating me like a child. I'm not stupid.  I know there's a problem.
We've been discussing that.  He wants to go to the Riviera - but I sort of lean toward Niagara Falls.
But Joe - this may be my last chance to marry a millionaire!
Naturally.  You think my fiance is a bum? Now I guess I'll have to give it back.
So?  It's going to break Sugar's heart when she finds out I'm not a millionaire.  That's life.  You can't make an omelette without breaking an egg.
Nag, nag, nag.  Look, we got a yacht, we got a bracelet, you got Osgood, I've got Sugar - we're really cooking.
Get me Room 414.
We're not on the pier yet -
What did you say?
I have a very low resistance.
You got some?
When?
I'm just going to get some ice.
Just a little trick I picked up in the elevator.
That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face -
I guess she's not in here.
Believe it or not - Josephine predicted the whole thing.
Yes.  He wants me to have supper with him - on his yacht - he's going to pick me up at the pier.
And talk about elegant - you should see the yacht - candlelight - mint sauce and cranberries.
- and you got to be girls.
Look, if William Morris doesn't come through -
Personally, I'm Type O.
You invest in shows?
Goodbye?
They got a Cuban band that's the berries. Why don't we go there - blindfold the orchestra - and tango till dawn?
That's good thinking.  Daphne's a push-over for him.
To Urbana.  It's a hundred miles.
Nellie baby, I'll make it up to you.
My car?  Why, you -
You need a bass and a sax, don't you?
It's not the backs that worry me.
William Morris!
If they catch me once more, they'll boot me out of the band.  You the replacement for the bass and the sax?
Where did he conduct?
I'll say.
Then one morning you wake up and the saxophone is gone and the guy is gone, and all that's left behind is a pair of old socks and a tube of toothpaste, all squeezed out.
I can tell you one thing - it's not going to happen to me again.  Ever. I'm tired of getting the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
What's in Florida?
I might as well stay in there. I won't be able to sleep anyway.
Forget it, Sugar, will you?  Forget about saxophone players.  You're going to meet a millionaire - a young one.
Just my feminine intuition.
My fault.
I don't think so.
Well, I'm not.
You're society girls?
Good school!  And your family doesn't object to your career?
You know, it's amazing we never ran into each other before.  I'm sure I would have remembered anybody as attractive as you.
I beg your pardon?
Tonight?
It's on the account of the shells. That's my hobby.
Yes, you're in the way.  He's waiting for a signal from his yacht.
It's been delightful meeting you both.
What?
It's not how long it takes - it's who's taking you.
Yes - now let's see - where do you suppose the steward set it up?
I don't mind if I do.
Oh, it's perfectly safe.  We're well anchored - the ship is in shipshape - and the Coast Guard promised to call me if there are any icebergs around.
Nothing at all?
You mean you can't fall in love?
Oh, no!
Have you ever tried American girls?
If I ever found a girl that could - I'd marry her like that.
I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.
It's like smoking without inhaling.
Lets throw another log on the fire.
Mineral baths - now really!
Did you have a nice time?
I'm going to see him again tonight - and every night - I think he's going to propose to me - as soon as he gets up his nerve.
From a rich millionaire.
You see, we have those oil interests in Venezuela - and I just got a cable from Dad - the board of directors decided on a merger.
Quite a while.  As a matter of fact, I'm not coming back at all.
It's all rather complicated - what we call high finance - but it so happens that the president of the Venezuelan syndicate has a daughter, and -
According to our tax advisers, she's only so-so.  But - that's the way the oil gushes. A man in my position has a certain responsibility to the stockholders - all those little people who invest their life savings -
I knew you would.
How can I?  No matter where I go, there'll always be a Shell station on the corner.  I'll bring this back when it's empty.
I told you - I'm not very bright.
That's because I've been on the wagon.
Where are they holding the wake? I'm supposed to be one of the pallbearers.
Who's going to raid a funeral?
You and who else?
You boys know anything about any garage - or any witnesses?
Yes, sir.
No, Spats - no, no, no -  NO!
Are you sure you’re okay?
Hey.
Yeah. Most important day of my life. Whatever. Listen, I chose you to be my Maid of Honor for a lot of reasons: I love you, you’re my favorite, and only, half-sister, blah blah blah. But the main reason I picked you is because you’ve been so miserable for the past few years, I knew you wouldn’t outshine me.  But here it is, my big day. My big day. And something doesn’t feel right. Maybe it was that pep talk you gave me last night, I don’t know, but your misery just isn’t working for me anymore.
It’s not me. I swear. It’s her. She’s magic.
Actually, I do.
Whatever you do, don’t mention Italy. Or politics. Or baby buggies.  Or Edith Piaf.
I’m sure General Eisenhower never had to master the finer points of the seating chart and centerpieces.  Oh, and tomorrow afternoon you are carpooling to the country with the Fletcher-Wootens.
Oh, no.  She tells this story at every major holiday.
Trust me. This is bigger than Tony Pee-Pants.
It’s been my experience that the people who hire a prostitute, need a prostitute.  You did the right thing.
Don’t be ridiculous. It’s late and the place is empty. Just take my car.
No.
Sorry, can you give us a moment?
Hello, Katmandu.
Hey, yourself.  I see you’ve met my ex.
Let me guess. Amy presumed I’d forget the rings.  I think I’m her least favorite person.  You know, I am sorry.
I have regrets.
Kat, we must talk. This guy, there’s something not quite right.
It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here.
It’s not supposed to be anything, Kat. It’s just my rather feeble attempt to.... Oh, I don’t know.  You see, I thought I could deny my feelings--
Well, it was a big deal. As late as...yesterday. Or this morning.  But not anymore.
I shagged Amy. Two years ago. That’s why I ended it. And then, after you left, sod it, we kept at it like rabbits until we both realized it was absolutely mad. And, you know, morally wrong. Then there was that one other time. And that was it.
Exactly. I want us to look like we fit, but not like we’re trying too hard to look like we fit.  It’s welcome cocktails, not prom. With this level of matchy-matchy, we should be drinking peach schnapps under a bleacher somewhere.
He was pretty drunk, but I think he’s still crazy about you.
It’s cute.
Shampoo, got it!
First of all, it’s never out of the blue. And second of all--
What?!
We kissed. Made out a little. Then you passed out.
Of course not. How...how could it be? Nothing happened.
Desperation?
Yeah.
You’re judging me?! Oh, that’s a good one. You’re lying to me, you’re lying to your family, and you’re lying to yourself. But you’re going to stand there and point a finger at me? The man you hired to pretend to be your boyfriend?
Then for once in your life, do something for yourself.
Just drunk enough.
Close. Sydney. Turns out, I missed the rain.
At least somebody’s using the damn thing.  I was gonna fix her up but we took one trip and the kids fought so much, we never launched her again.
I say that feeling compelled to do the opposite of your parents is as enslaving as emulating them.
--and The ass of The man who adores her.
You don't live around here, do you?
Me and Sounder went to this prison camp to see my Daddy and the police guard runs us away and I fell on some glass.
Thank you, Miss Johnson.
I try...
That's where we come from first?
What's his name?
He'll get his place too -- now off with your clothes and into bed.
Because all you could think of was getting away from the guard.
What do I tell my mama when I get home? I didn't find him and that's what I wanted to do.
Yes, Miss Johnson...
No, Miss Johnson...
Yes mam...
:His mother, with her head thrown back, her eyes aglitter and laughing.
I did look, Charlie, but I--
Looks that way, son. Guess the cold done drove most of 'em down to the big water country -- but if there's one left out here -- we gotta find him.
It was too dark, Daddy.
Naww -- he'll come back to you, soon as his wounds heal. This cake shore is tasty, son.
Just do like I tell you -- I'll get word to you through the visitin' preacher.
We goin' huntin' again, Daddy !?
I cleaned and oiled all your stuff while you was gone...
Goodnight to you, son...
Mornin', Daddy...
Thank you, Daddy...
You won't be goin' to jail again, will you, Daddy?
No, no, I'm all right, son... This damn leg just won't act right no more!
David, come back here!
Listen, Mama...
I can do it, Mama -- you know that. In the Bible stories you read to us, everybody's always goin' on a long journey. Jacob goes into a strange land where his uncle is and he don't even know where he lives, but he finds him. Everybody finds what they supposed to find.
Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.
It's the heat.
He won't go mad -- he's just lookin' for a cooler spot.
Yes mam... We gotta go, Miss Boatwright.. .
I'll walk...
What did the Lord tell you, Ike?
Any time it's Saturday and I don't hafta do any work, I'm doin' okay!
Mama, when kin me and Earl go to school with David Lee?
The boy is hungry, Rebecca.
Mornin'...
To invite you to his house -- the two of you could just sit under the shade tree, drink ice cold whiskey, and just shoot the breeze!
You mean to tell me I can't see my own husband?
There are more important matters right now...
Uh, can I finish? Can I finish? ...The fact is that we Canadians are quite surprised by your outrage-
OW!! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!! THIS ISN'T FAIR!!! YOU SONS A BITCHE--
That's right, Mr. Garrison. The environment is what surrounds us. It is what we live and breathe.
I said -
They're burning all the Canadian stuff cause of the war.
I saw him last night!
Oh.
Yeah!  And what rim job expert went and outlawed Cheesy Poofs!?
Dude, they cut out 92 minutes!
Tell 'em we'll have pie and punch.
I have to say 'behind'! I get shocked if I say 'ass-  OW!!!
Whoops.
WAGAGAHGHGH!! YOU GUYS!!! SERIOUSLY!!!
No you can't Kenny!
MPH RMPH RMPH RMPH RM!!!
Okay.    Not.
Mom... When is the war gonna be over?
Sure, hon. Goodnight.
Oh man, I'm gonna need a cherry pie to get the taste of ass out of my mouth from that piece of shit movie.
This is it! The time for action is NOW!!  <b>Something must be done! This is like a spreading rash! They're pulling out our children's brains and filling them with trash! Can't you see what this is leading to? A world of smut and sex and poo! I believe the good fight has begun! Something must be done!</b>
This will be very dangerous... Are you quite sure?
Baba mama!
Mph rmph rm rmph rm.
Oh, you want out of hell, huh?
MOM!!!
God? ...Let me tell you something about God... He is ze biggest bitch of zem all.
For pooping, silly.
What's a dying giraffe sound like?
Kay.
Oh... Alright, back you go.
Aw, God Damn it, he's singing that fucking song again.
Yeah, let's swear we won't tell!
You bastards!!
It isn't fair!
Our moms suck!
Totally!
What has the world come to? This is horrible. We're locked up, burning books, hating other people-
Wow!
No, dude, all you have to do is hit the keys really fast and say a bunch of stupid shit and it works.
Wake up, people!  We all have to do things that aren't pretty sometimes! It's the not pretty things that make life worth fighting the not pretty things for! Why do you think children have to be born in hospitals?
Oh, uh...  I don't know if air strikes are necessary.
Oh.
Very encouraging. Most of the children have been weened from their naughty mouths.
I did, Terrance, I learned that you are a boner biting dick fart fuck face!
I know, Terrance.  This is quite the shitstorm we've found ourselves in this time.
I know, Terrance. I know.
Terrance! NO!
Indeedy, that was a delicious choice of words!
I am.
I know.
Don't call me dumb!
Who gives a fuck?! I was just fucking with him!
Relax bitch!  You're better seen, not hear okay?
Come on guy, you know I only rib you because I love you so much!
THAT'S IT!  I HAVE HAD ENOUGH!!!!
That's nice, Stan.
Yup.
This is about freedom of speech, Stan, about censorship.
Hi Stan.
Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice cream?
Sounds like you've been talking to Mac too much.
Well it's a good thing that I did.
There must be some mistake. You sure you hit the right commands?
Why don't you reset and run it again.  The pods check out ok.
Trust me.  Even checked 'em with my own eyes.
It's steady, good benefits.
Uh...
What are you talking about! Can you transmit the code 3 -
Who said I'll re-enter in the pod? I got friends out in space, Ryan, friends willing to get me back unnoticed.  Thank God for deregulation huh?
Will you transmit the distress signal?
Taylor, you surprise me.
That's me.
I know, I know.
The others decided to get cute with me, so I'm teaching them a lesson!
Well blaze your ass out of there! You've completely altered your trajectory, are we linking up or not?!
I told you, I had to teach a few people a lesson!
Let's get something straight, Chappy!
This is a major screw up on your part, goddamn it!
Not me.  I'm in for the long haul. In nine months I'll have enough to take a few years off.
I don't have a problem with it. Besides, you get to meet a lot of interesting people.
Will you shut up already?
Just don't move around too much.
I don't know.
Just considering our options... sir.
It depends on the condition of the ship.  If I could get to one of the suit compartments I could check the exterior air locks for a possible entry.
With what?  How am I going to interface with it?  I need to be able to talk to the system and to have the system talk to me.
Yeah, let's hope he can find a way through.
Ready as I'll ever be.
One of Barnes' duds, luckily for us.  Take this out of the equation right now...
Yeah?
Sure.
Words to live by.
It was no time to lose my partner. We're going to have to hurry, he's on to us.
A schematic of the ship.  Looking for a lifeline to the pods.
That's why we need a safe passage. remember what you said earlier, about getting through the wall? That might just be our ticket.
We don't have time.  I'll explain later, hurry!
It would matter to us.
Congratulations on your...recent award.
He's up on the bridge!  He's going to be OK.  Now who's missing?
He's in the bathroom.
Are you nuts!  It's too risky!
I'll tell you what you're gonna do.  You're gonna stay put like Taylor said.
Alteration of my central processing unit should be done only by an authorized service dealer.
Yes.  You can enjoy some wonderful views from there.
I would recommend a maintenance crew in this sector.
That's affirmative.
You're not from around here, are you?
Nope.
He's my dad.
You tried to make it look like Junior trashed his place. Junior's underground in that coffin you dicks put him in.
What do you want with old man Faz?
We're looking for Buzz Fazeli, seen him?
So Buzz, let's skedaddle. Mr. Kastle is waiting. As Buzz gets up, Theo rises and steps between his father and the two sleazeballs.
La da da dalala...
It was a clearance.
No kiddin'.
You don't need coffee, Mr. Fazeli; you need a vacation. Sheila catches sight of Theo pulling into the parking lot. She puts a Ken head earring in her right ear. Buzz follows Sheila's gaze.
You knew her. You married her in 1963.
I got a right. You're my father.
You know what a mixer ball is? It's like you, you come out of nowhere and upset things, scattering everything all over. Buzz grumpily waves at him to sit.
Theo! This is Sheila Kastle, my partner's daughter.
What's it look like to you?
Don't say that about my mom!
I don't need the stinking pro-tour.
I was beaten on a shot named after my own dad. The moment passes. Theo turns and climbs into his car. He looks up at Buzz.
I'm goin' straight. No more short cuts. Theo gets into the car. Buzz leans in the open window.
Hello, mom?
I gotta go. Love ya mom.
I was doing the lambada with her and the guy freaks, he breaks my arm, tries to kill me. I swear man, the guy thought I was a pi–ata. If nobody else hadn't a been there, he wouldn't have stopped. He woulda killed me. Fuckin' guy man, just snapped. How do you like your burger?
I'll tell you one thing, you won't see me around that alley with that freak on the loose. Stay away from his ass - and don't play any of his fuckin' knock-knock jokes.
It feels good to let it out, doesn't it? Sheila leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
You played bouncy-bouncy with Sheila, so I'm gonna play Blue-Face with you. 
Who's there?
Blueface! Blueface is my favorite.
That's right, didn't you have a slight control problem in a recent tournament,champ?  Now go take out your "big four", darling.  Come on, we're making her nervous.
If it springs a leak, it'll be because Buzz is making waves.
He's earned an early retirement.  But enough about losers; Buzz Fazeli is history. Lets talk about your future.  I wanna show you something.
What ever happened to just bowling?
Why would you help me?
That's why Mom ran away, because you had to control everything!
Bowling "Center"!
No, no, that's too far. Try a more gentle stroke. It's all in the stroke. Go ahead, now, honey - stroke. As the camera comes around the side of the whale, we see an elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports coat and white slacks hunched over a diminutive fiftyish woman.  His back is to the camera and he is wearing a baseball cap with a plastic halo attached to it.
They suspended me.
I'm sorry about Zeus, Millie.
I'm not here to - I can't...
No, not at all.
The ladies in Akron call them thigh- ticklers.
No, I'm fascinated.
Nothing.
Nope, I couldn't care less.
Zip.
You got any broken bones?
Why not?
He's my father.
Who said anything about an ultimatum? You want to find your father? Get a shovel and start digging. Hurry up, he's probably in Purgatory by now. Sheila makes a pathetic attempt to speed away from Theo. He moves up beside her again.
I'm not dumping you, I'm suspending you.
I'm not here to bowl.
The body was identified along proper Bowling Congress guidelines for processing a bowling related fatality.
It's burning...
I can't...
Of what we're able to measure, roughly twenty-six hundred feet.
Back away then.
How about I just press the button?
Yeasts?  Thank you, Beth, but I don't think we're gonna open it up and find a loaf of bread.
Edmunds, do you have a 20 on Norman?
Two and a half days?
Yeah.  I heard you.
What do we use for defense?
High Voltage?
He's right beneath us.
What team?
What?
As best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago.
It doesn't make any sense.
What do you mean, he's missing?
How drastic?
So you knew this when you wrote your report?
I think we should be careful. Consider his emotional response.
Jerry?  Please.  Stop this.
So do we.  And it seems to have picked up something on it's travels.
A break for what?
The what?
Let's say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us, just like we are to, say, medieval Europe.  Suppose you went back to medieval Europe with a TV set.  There wouldn't be any place to plug it in.
Ladies and Gentlemen...
Please watch your closest monitor...
She's not gonna know, sir.
If the technology of that sphere is advanced enough -- the way it functions is gonna appear to us like magic.
The wing dimension alone is larger that any aircraft we've seen.
Nobody goes inside, until we know <u>what's</u> inside.
Radiation shield, you think?
Sir, about leaving --
To what?
Captain, I personally feel we should ask much more substantive questions --
Too big?
I've read it twice, Norman.  It's brilliant.
What -- are you threatening me?
What?
Yeah, why?
So what?
You went through Edmunds' things?
I have to reset the sub.
I think so, Beth.  Yes.
I don't know, Beth.  I wasn't there.
What do you mean, a part of Harry?
You think, in the sphere --
But how?
Sintag.
Does it cause drowsiness?  That's all we need.  To get him unconscious -- put him under.
Bingo.
I'll just boost the doses.
You think I'd really drink that?
You put explosives around the habitat, I can't imagine what you'd put in a drink.
If I was, then I would've had to have gone in the sphere, wouldn't I?
You think I manifested the snakes?
Yes, someone did.  But it wasn't me, Norman.  It was you.  You manifested the snakes.
C'mon -- what?
Promise what, Norman?  Tell me!
You think I'd belive you?  Believe anything you might say now?  After you lied to me about telling Barnes about my past.  About my problems.  My problems.  Not yours.  Not his.  Mine.
Get away from the door, Beth.
Don't fuck with me, Beth.
Don't you know?
It's you, Norman.  Your fear of drowning.  You have to face it.
You'd have to ask them.
I never said that.
That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.
No I'm not.  I'm not star--
Fine.  I'm fine.
Wait a second, I --
Look, would you --
I'm completely serious.  There is something very important missing from that spacecraft.  You know what that is?
Curious, isn't it?  What's inside? Before I die, I'd sure like to open it and see.
That far in what, Harry?
What happened to her?
How do we decode it?
Is that why the two of you went through my dufflebag?
Hold on.
Are you trying, damn it?  Just --
Hurry, Norman.  Four minutes.
I'm trying to keep balance with --
You got her?
Nine hundred feet to surface.
Good.  Thank you.  Now that I have it on.  Why are you laughing?  You don't even know what that means.
You mean forget?
Gimme some room here, will you?  Back off.  Gimme some space.
Shutup, Ted.  You didn't notice shit. Keep hammering.
But it's impossible.
Think about it.
It's been obvious from the start, hasn't it, Captain?  That's why all the secrecy, why no one was told about it?
Meaning?
Thank you.
Captain who?
Told me what?
Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote.
What the hell would a geologist be doing at a plane crash?
This is like nursery school.
Unless it's an act.
When he uses a phrase like "I am Happy", I think we should think twice about what we ask him.
Four.  Four years --
I'm not taking you on an impossible search across the galaxy... I was only paid to get you here and now you're here.  I'll take my other five thousand and you're on your own... I'll leave you on the nearest system.
Who's going to pay me then?
We'll be back before you are, old man.
I know that.
You could put it that way.
Don't you have a Kiber crystal?
Five, maybe.  Let me handle it.
He's bluffing...
Yes, sir.  I was considered one of the best bush pilots on Sullust. I've also had six hours on the T-2.
Send one squad up.
The fourth moon of Yavin.  I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.
Did it occur to you they might find us?
You're good with 'remotes,' but how are you against something living?
Move out of the way!
Thanks, old buddy.  I'll be with you in a second.
Who is this?  What's your operating...
It would be much easier if you were to tell us where the outposts are... Otherwise we'll be forced to destroy every suspicious system... What a waste...
You're safe.  We've come to get you out of here... Just relax.
There'll be time for that later. Now let's get out of here.
I will, but I'll have enough time to transmit my application first.
Several, I think.  There is not much to tell.  I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories, not at making them interesting anyway...
If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I don't see how anyone could live in this forsaken place.
No, you're not.  What kind of talk is that...
I know, sir, but it's the principle of the thing.
Send feed-back into the control sensors in that Detention block.
I read you sir.
I'm afraid we're not plugged in at the moment, sir.  We've had some problems.
See Threepio!  Do you copy?
Are you there, sir?  We're going...
Bye ! Write me ! I'm gonna kill you guys !
What's the hurry ?
Ace of spades.
Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ?
I got Games & Theory.
Dizzy wouldn't want our tears. She'd want us to remember her... with a vengeance. So go out and kill a bug for Dizzy. Kill as many as you can. You are her revenge, and every bug you kill honors her death.
This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet.
They revoke our flight status.
Oh, I don't know... Depends on who you are spending it with.
No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way.
Zander, please... Let's go !
You weren't thinking...you were dreaming !
There's a war on. I want a command, I want my own ship, you do, too...
Just giving you something to remember me by, baby.
Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers.
Why not ?
Sometimes I do what I want, eh ?
I'll meet you outside.
Yeah, sure, I guess.
You two have so much in common.
I can't help it.
Who cares ?
Shhh...
Whoa ! Way to go, boy-yo !
I'll go for that.
Hey, it's just a vestigal response to procreation... bitch.
What happened to your eye ?
See you on the bounce !
We've gotta go get her !
Yes, ma'am.
You were drifting. Flip six, three hole. On one, got it ?
Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.
That you don't have what it takes to be acitizen !
I'm gonna need a squad leader.
Nah, I don't do that anymore...
Teenagers !
Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it.
AAAAAAAAAAA !
Sounds more like some idiot at Military Intelligence Command wants to get me and my cap troopers killed...
Sir, yes, sir !
Sir, yes it is, sir.
I've made a mess of things. I've been so stupid...
This would be mine, sir. Acting Sergeant John Rico. I've assumed command on this mission.
Yeah, that's right.
Not a problem.
SHUT UP, SIR ! We need pick up now !
Then I hope you have a crazy pilot ! Keep the line open, Dizzy !
The difference lies in the field of civic virtue. A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic, of which he is a member, defending it, if need be, with his life. The civilian does not.
To join with him.
Because V'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet.
That is logical. You may procede.
-- You, personally, are assuming command?
None available, Captain. There's no one in fact, who's fully rated on this design.
Sir, you haven't logged a single star hour in two and a half years. That, plus your unfamiliarity with the ship's design -- in my opinion, sir, seriously jeopardizes our mission.
Yes, sir, I'll do that.
No...  ... that could also be misinter- preted as hostile, Mr. Decker.  Cloud composition, Mr. Spock?
Capture God! In order to retrieve V'ger's data, the Creator has to physically come here!...
That probe in there -- in a different form now -- is the same thing that <U>killed</U> Ilia!
A tractor beam...
V'ger has begun to understand the true limits of our universe, thereby realizing the existence of other dimensions. To fulfill itself it must evolve to a higher dimension; V'ger believes this can be achieved only by joining with the Creator.
If I'd seen you again, would you have been able to say it?
Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.
Twelve seconds...!
Impact in fifteen seconds...
Accelerating to Warp One, sir.
Viewer ahead, sir.
Thrusters ahead, one third.
Why aren't the Enterprise transporters in operation, Mister Scott?
Negative, Captain. I could sense only what seemed an almost omniscient pattern of perfect logic. I can explain nothing more; I understand nothing more.
Instruments fluctuating, Captain. Patterns unrecognizable.
Yes, Captain, a child: evolving into adulthood -- learning, searching -- instinctively needing.
... and then to reassemble itself <U>combined</U> with the Creator. The most certain way of obtaining all the Creator's answers.
Captain, it was our anti-matter imbalance that created the wormhole in the first place. It will happen again if we don't correct it.
We're ready, sir.
Helm ready, sir.
Local Drama Group.  Northern Books.  No, it hasn't come in yet.  As soon as it does.  Yup, you too Marge.
I need a typewritter.
That's why they have state borders... whyn't you get a replacement?
You quit.
It's in your play.
Yes.
It's about life.
N'about ten minutes.  What was your movie about?
As the Old Mill goes around...
No, no.  Of course, that's <u>exactly</u> what it represents...
I live there.
Mmm.
You're still here.
I don't drink.
The other side.
Why?
Time for a change.  Keep your margins straight.
Has been wounded by <u>her</u> heat...by her <u>infidelities</u>...
Hi.
No.  You, I told them, you can't betray with the picture what you're saying with the words.  And, I don't know, the movies, I don't know.  They should be socially uplifting, why does she have to show her br...what is this...?
Is it...
I'd love to.
You got to tell em that you saw the accident.  Don't you?
Maybe they'll be <u>other</u> movies.
I'm going to tell the truth.
If I go to jail...?
...I'm sure that people are upset...
What I am <u>saying</u>, is, we have to Look Out For Our Own...Now:  they want to close down Main Street...
We had a date.
Wai...It's so serious you couldn't call to tell me you'd be...what...?  What did you say...?
Let me review here: You're...what are you...you've...it's all over between us?
That a fact.  Now, is it a good play?
Well, then, what's he doing here?
You doin' here, Doug, thought you started out the day with that pernicious <u>caffeine</u>...
Well, they don't always leave with the ones they came in with.
What?
They know what her tits look like.
I'm somewhere in the, I'm on location, eh:  This...well I'm going to solve it here, or this <u>Bimbo</u> you sent me's going to be doing a fuckin' <u>donkey</u> act in Akron, I'm talking about Restraint of Trade, Breach of...IT'S VERY SIMPLE...!
Town in New Hampshire was small town America too.  Forty thousand dollars a day, to shoot on the street.  And <u>then</u> they kicked us out...
You told me that about the <u>last</u> town.
Waterford, Vermont.  Where is it?  <u>That's</u> where it is...
Fifteen hands.
You know who the <u>father</u> is...?
Uh, <u>look</u>....
...I was just talking to that girl in the other room.
I <u>know</u> my lines...

You want to see it better, we could go out on the roof.
I swear that that woman in my room...
Thanks, honey, but, next time, bring two, save yourself a trip.
Tell it with <u>pictures</u>.
Hold on: what Bob is saying, you don't need...
Bob, Bob, stick to the business, will you?
I've always seen that.
How could she turn on me like that?  I thought she liked me.
Of course he...
I'm an attorney, if there's anything you have to say to...
Well, Officer, don't worry ab...
It's night.
There's other things to be learned.
Well, what's the beef?
Then what is the...?
I really think that <u>business</u>...matters should be discussed between you t...
Cool it, Babe, you started this...
She's absolutely r...
I like you, too.
She came in here, wait, she...I was giving her a massage...wait...Wait!  She came in here...she...  ...with respect...she took off her clothes, and she got in <u>bed</u>, I told her I could not--we don't know each other, you see...
I just...
Listen to me:  Elanora <u>Duse</u> was playing Hamlet in London in 1905, and Royalty could not get a ticket.  She said, "I'm not doing the seven shows a week I signed for."  She said, "I cannot bare my soul seven times a week.  I am an artist. I'll do four shows a week."  The greatest actress of her time.  You know what her Producer said?
Nothing.  He held her and he wept. Because he...
He's staying here?  Bob Barrenger is staying he...?
Her religion bars her from fulfilling her contr...
Well.
Who got their heads cut?
I, uh...I'm leaving.
Main Street.
I want to talk to him.  Would you ex...
My wife just went into labor...
He should be put in jail.
You should.
Sure.
I can't find the writer.
Some, you were, you were going to make a reservation for us?  Where's my schedule? Where are we <u>booked</u> tonight?
You what...?  Is that on the callsheet, is that on the callsheet, or is that <u>personal business</u>?  Ah, Christ. <u>Marty</u>...Are we <u>paying</u> you?
I was in New Hampshire.  I was at the Old Location.
You know, they told me there were gonna be some jokes.  Kid the New Guy...
The girl was in the car.
Her tits!  Her tits!  How, that she signed IN HER CONTRACT, we hired her 'cause of ten years at the Actors Studio? The way she played <u>Medea</u>?...Her last two pictures laid there on the screen like my first <u>wife</u>...
I really don't think you should be talking this way to a lady.
I...?  I saw it.  I was there.
You told me you were writing.  Don't you wear your reading glasses to write...?
I'm...Tuesday evening we're having an informal dinner, I didn't know you'd be 'on set,' but if you'd like to join your...
What'd you do, <u>build</u> this...?
My undies, cause, you can't get this picture off on time I'm gonna' wet myself.
Find the money.
I don't want to invite someone else, because this is the <u>most</u> <u>exclusive</u>...
Aren't these <u>illegal</u>?
No, I'm serious, election's coming up, a lot of people are pretty upset...
Waal, what was the per-screen average...?
Ain't no second chances in life.
Givvem a cigarette...
Wally, I got to takes out that window from the dog.  I can't shoot through...
Because they gots a window with a dogs in it.  You want me to "push in."  Or I can lose the shot.
I have to work on my video project! Don't follow me!  I can put myself to bed.
I don't care.
I hate when you say that.
Look if the truth is you don't feel like talking about this right now that's fine. But don't look me in the eye with a big smile on your face and lie to me. Cause there are only so many lies you're allowed to tell before it starts showing on your face.  You wind up looking like...
Sex.  Of course.
But you only wore mascara when you and Daddy went on romantic dates...
THEN TURN OFF THE CARTOON!
Not with my mouth open.
Oh, yeh.
I'm not.
I didn't forget.  I was up all night thinking about it and I concluded you're too special to look like everyone else.  Orange Red.  That's your color.  Few can carry it off.  Now please.  Help me find your brother.
Of course not.  Does he look lost to you?  BENNNNN!!!
Here.
Thank God for that!
<u>Just</u> where I wanna be all Saturd...
Why don't you say hello?
IT'S NOT YOUR <u>FAULT</u>!!
...laughed, yeh.  They laughed real hard.
Ice cold water.
Annabelle put down that camera.
Cos she loves you.
No!
IT'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND, BIG GUY, OPEN UP.
Seven of clubs.  Nobody's mad we just want to talk about it.
I knew where I was all the time.
Is that like Luigi's?
Thursday's fine...
Heaven.  I have to tell him he's made a mistake.  He should take Grammy Martha first.  Or Grandpa Norman.
How do you know?
No, it isn't.  Because it isn't everything.  And we want every- thing, don't we?
Every day.  More and more.
Let's take our best shot.
Sooner than later.  You really need to.
Except for last Thursday when Rachel forgot to pick them up --
You tried that last week and we were on hold forty-five minutes...
I'm worried.
Don't do this.
Just not to me.
No.  You think this is going to help the kids then you do it.  You're on your own.
A lot smaller.
I'm sure that didn't upset her. Everyone in our family takes showers.
No.  I thought it might be uncomfortable for her --
But it's not on the schedule!
You're not terribly good at taking care of h...
It's okay, it's twenty minutes.  The horse'll be there.
Hey.  At least it's not an editing machine.
Anxiety.
Wowie.  How wonderful!
Hey, any help you need, we'll cover.
I was looking for Annabelle's book, and I found your tickets.  And the note.  From your new boss.
We can't live like that.
Toi.  They've been 'going out' for two weeks.
...going out, yeh.  I had kids of my own, once.
Brad Kovitsky.
No.
Do what you've worked your whole life to do?
You mean, after I'm dead?
Feeling the pressure?
And her...?
Is that what he told you?
He looks familiar.  Did he do a Calvin Klein ad?
Don't be too sure.
It doesn't matter, I didn't tell h...
Give 'em my number.
Is that what you're worried about? Looking bad at the PTA?
Aw.
That's not wh...
You weren't passing 'em out.
<u>That's</u> what it is.  And that's <u>all</u> it is.
No, there isn't.
What do I have that you don't?
Just sit me up.  Nice and tall. Bring Benjamin first.
So I'll have to order in?
They don't hate you --
I think so...What do you think?
Rache, it may take time.
It's Anna Sui, you should be doing it.
Well, they will be.
You took a fishing trip with the boys. Liked it so much, you took another.
...while she watched the kids.  Then, you booked this flat in Paris for your family's summer.  But she said...
What do you call it?  You told her you had doubts.
I'm gonna get me a drink.
Maybe he's gay.
Hmmm...Do I know any...personally...?
What?
Yes, Mikey?
Mi Jesus esta muerto!
My grandchild-baby.
Well, I'm not really sure what you're trying to say. It's funny, I suppose. But it seems glib and facile to just make fun of how idiotic these people are.
Yes, I do. I love them!
I don't know. Maybe they'll like it.
Boys, take napkins...Napkins...
Got a lot of homework?
Don't worry, he doesn't mean money.
Huh?
Oh. What happens now?
You'll read it in class tomorrow. Surprise me.  Anyway, I have to go. I promised Melinda I'd help her with her oral.
Don't be so upset. It's OK...
'Cause Scooby does have a quality that I've been looking for, a quality that is emblematic of American today. It's part disillusionment, part hope...
Man, it's just, like, conversation.
One in a million recover.
OK!
Hi, Dad!
Gee, you're home early!
Sure, Dad.
Take off your top.
'Fuck me hard!'
Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
Hello, is this Pam?
Oh, fine. How are you?
Great!
That's what I was gonna ask you.
Hunh.
Yeah.
No, I don't think so...
I'm not an idiot, man. I watch TV.
Yeah?
So where'd you get in?
Sure…um…yeah, as soon as I have a screening I'll let you know.
Well, I-I hope that--that--
Well get someone down there!
We don't have time!
No but you didn't defend him either! Didn't want to rock the boat.  Guess the ride was too smooth. FILMORE I was acting under legal counsel!
Well Cooper...
I don't see why they wouldn't be.
It's nothing to worry about.
Are you going to kill us?
Shut up!
I don't want any...
She's still alive.
We've prohibited the networks from broadcasting the transmissions.
What the hell is it, anyhow?
I'm in to the directory but they've codified the stockpile--numerically.
You're fucking crazy Richter--you know that?
If I don't get power up we are!
The report is entirely untrue.  I can assure you of that.
Goodbye, Mister Ambassador.
Oh, yes, that's right.
What do you think of this, Mister President?  I told you we shouldn't let him in here.
Look, General Ripper went off his rocker and ordered the 843rd Bomb Wing to attack with H-bombs.
Look, Colonel.  You keep me covered, but let me just pick up this red telephone that connects to Air Command headquarters. Okay?...I won't play any tricks on you... Okay?
Look, Colonel.  Maybe it's too late. Maybe they've sent Air Command in already.  But we've got to try to con- tact somebody.
No, sir.
I know it sounds crazy, sir, but we tried, and nobody answers any of the telephones.
I am aware of what a condition red alert implies.
That's a very wise deduction, General.
That certainly would be a problem, sir.
Do you recognize my voice?
No, sir.
Condition Red!
A shooting war!
That's right, sir.
Please don't take any notice of this weapon, Major.  I love all weapons, and as of late, I've just taken to keeping a loaded weapon nearby at all times.
That's right, Major.
Well, sir, I was thinking, if an enemy attack is in progress, how come the radio's still playing music?  It's supposed to go off, and all we should hear are Civil Defense broadcasts.
I know that, sir.
To peace on earth.
If we haven't taken any further action, they certainly will.  Doyyourhappen to remember the statistics on our casualties in the event of a full-scale enemy attack?
You're being dense, Major.  I certainly don't
But, General, we're on our toes.  We haven't agreed to anything for years.  Inffact, a a lot of people say we never will.
Peace on earth.
What the hell is Plan-R?
Naturally I am, sir.
Well, if you choose to take his word over mine ---
Well, sir, it looks like one aircraft, the "Leper Colony", failed to receive the recall.
If I can speak freely, sir -- look, these guys talk big, but frankly, we think they're short of know-how.  You can't just take a bunch of ignorant peasants and expect them to understand a machine like one of our boys, and I don't mean that as an insult, Mister Ambassador.  Hell, we all know what kind of guts your people have.  Why just look how many millions of 'em those Nazis  killed and, hell, they still wouldn't quit.
Well, sir, if the A/C's a really good man, I mean really sharp, why he can barrel that plane along so low - well you just have to see it some time.  A real big plane, like a Sting Ray, zig-zagging in, its jet exhaust frying chickens in the barnyard ---  Has he a chance?.....Hell, yes!  He has one hell of a chance.
Give me revs for maximum speed at sea level.
Maybe it's an exercise.
They must have clobbered some of our cities already!
Main interference linked to electronic detector.  Fight interference on readi- ness state.
Missile and plane flight path computer showing four greens.
Speed?
Call them every five miles.
I think they mean business.
Sure, I'll take her up to eight hundred.
Roger, I'm setting up the CRM-114.
Ready, Major.
Damn you, Lieutenant Toejam!  Lothar!
Skip it and jump, damn you!  This flak's so close, I can smell it.
Our targets are a missile complex and an airfield - not cities, right?
Well, if they hit us first, they've probably fired off their missiles and got their planes off the ground already.  We'll just be hitting empty real estate.
When do you want to arm the bomb for the primary, Major?
Seond safety.
Master Kong.
Everything still checks out okay.
Lothar, get up here fast, and bring your First- Aid kit!  I'm hit kinda bad, I think.
In the back...feels like an arrowhead.
Hell, he looks dead.
Well, we sure as hell aren't going home just because the enemy tells us to.
I don't get you, King.
Sorry, King.
It's me - Lothar.  Are you okay?
But I get a red light.
But I TOLD YOU, I don't think we can get the bomb bay doors open.
Let me check.
Would it matter if they hit at a flat angle? I mean, do you think the deuterium mass might separate from the atomic trigger?
Roger.
What the hell are you doing here, Lothar?
Now what the hell did you want to go and do a thing like that for, Lothar?
I'd be mighty proud if you did, Lothar.
Listen, Lothar.  You know that crack I made about your...butt?
I just wanted you to know I didn't mean anything by it.
Well, I just wanted you to know how I felt. Hell, I know Air Command wouldn't have taken you if you weren't okay.  And don't think I don't know some of our best ball-players and entertainers are of Negro descent.
Alright. She told him to meet us here. Fuck.
Yeah.
Was it okay?
Typical male.
Tim, he listens to you. Do you think it's a good idea? Seriously?
Yeah, I'm a nurse's aide at Mercy.
Oh, some of 'em. But it's mostly just strokes and shit. I mean, most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow. Usually they die id they're, you know, really yellow.
Oh, no, it's not. I mean, they're not all totally in a coma. I mean, they know when I'm helping them.
I don't smoke dubes and I don't really hang out. But I'll go back. Okay.
Buff, that slice is the difference between life and death for some half-dead Bangladeshi.
You should get upset. Everyone should get upset. When, when Hitler was greasing the Jews, people were saying, "Don't get me upset. Your bumming me out." My duty as a human being is to be pissed off. Jesus Christ, not that it makes a difference on the first fucking place. Nothing ever changes, man. Fifty years from now we're all gonna be dead and there'll be new people standing here drinking beer, eating pizza, bitching and moaning about the price of Oreos, and they won't even know we were ever here. And then fifty years after that those suckers will be dust and bones and there'll be all these generations of suckers trying to figure out what they're doing on this fucking planet and they'll all be full of shit. It's all so fucking futile.
Oh, come on, man. Tell me you wouldn't love it!
... idiot! Open the damn door! Go, go, go, come on!
You know what? Go with him. Just go with him.
No.
No, no, I wasn't trying.
No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.
No, no.
No.
Let's go look, then. Let's go look, then!
Guess not.
Jeff! Let's go!
Wait, what happened to the tree?
Hey, wait, where's Bee-Bee? Bee-Bee! Bee-Bee, where'd you go? Did you guys see where she went?
Buff, please, would you jus fuck off, okay? Fuck off!
Yeah.
I'm so burnt-out.
Hey, hey, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
We're your customers. We're not complaining.
That's it. That's it! I'm calling the police.
Look, look, I'm not joking around now, okay? Come on, let's go, let's go!
Yeah, we're just screwing around. Like Mohammed said. Can't take a joke, man? Hey, I hope you got a permit for that, mama!
Oh, thanks. Thanks.
Naw, naw, we don't have time for all that.
Oh, yeah, all the time. That's what I do now.
Okay.
It's nice here. It's different.
What'd he get you?
Mm.
Oh, yeah?
Erica. So do you think you and I are alike, Erica?
It's nice to do a lot of things.
Short pieces, huh? You should try to write songs.
Funny shit, man.
Thank you.
Yeah, well, he's from a Third World country. He doesn't have it easy.
What? Oh, come on. You're not gonna suck my cock?
No.
Fuck 'em! Fuck 'em all, man!
No, no. I'm not, I'm not talking about this. I did a bad thing, Jeff.
Yeah, of course they let me out. Chickenshits. I gotta pay some class C misdemeanor ticket. So did I call it or did I call it? She spent the night, didn't she? Hm? Oh, that sucks for you, pal. Oh, shit.
You want to know what your problem is, Jeff? You want to believe so bad, you'll buy anything. It's true. Look at you. You're gullible and you're gutless.
Well, you know, all I can say is, you're a fucking fool.
I'm a loser. And I'm drunk. But I'm not gutless.
Yeah, well, thank you for the advice, but you wouldn't understand what is going on with me.
Nazeer Chaudry!
I don't know. I think she's breathing.
No.
Well, fuck! Might as well not do anything! Let's just stick out thumbs up our asses and twirl.
One!
Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, right. Fuck you.
You know, all you know is what's good for you.
It was just something that got out of hand. Did anyone get hurt?
Okay, but nothing happened. Believe me, if I thought something really bad was going to happen, I would've done something.
I would've stopped it.
Nothing.
Okay, look. My job is not who I am. I don't need that. Why? What's your goal? Status? Money? Getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine?
Is that a threat?
I'm leaving. Is that alright with you? Do I have your permission? Maybe you want to think about it.
Yes, Jeff, away. Away, away, away.
Shit, Jeff!
No, maybe not though. That, that's what I'm trying to say.
Oh, fuck it, man!
Hey, the driver knows Billy Idol. Wow, huh?
Oh yeah, yeah, we're starting to get good placement and shit like that, you know.
So how's college?
No, man, I mean it. You're a good writer. I remember those things you'd write during honors English. Funny shit.
Yeah, maybe later.  Hey! Hey!
What?
Well, I, I didn't say I was special, but it's one thing, you know, and it's another thing to actually communicate it to people. You know what I mean? If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does that make a sound?
Oh, no, man, look. Look, you know, it's me, okay? I come out here and I'm, so used to everyone, you know, kissing my ass and I think I'm a fucking star, man, and I'm really sorry if I'm full of attitude. I, I really...
No. You know what? You guys go ahead and bring back something here. Yeah.
I don't know.
Well, you gotta call your wife then, you know, 'cause she kind of handles these heavy matters anyway, right?
Oh, shit. Jeff. Jeff, come up here!
What are you saying?
This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
Oh, yeah?
Oh, no, man. I can't.
No, no, no, no, no. Uh, hey, man. You know I'm really sorry if I, if I said something wrong. I, I...
Yeah, but sometimes I try to figure out why I left in the first place, you know? I think about people and I wonder what they're doing.
Oh, my god!
Yeah?
Really? What else does your mother say?
I called Bucky's. I got her a cab. Is there any hot mustard?
She didn't say. Maybe she's at the bar at the hotel.
Missed it. Can I get a fifth of Old Crow?
At least I have a point of view, you know?
You have the largest penis. Can we go please?
Oh that's nice for you.
You piece-a-shit bug zapper!
Forget it.  I've got a scholarship to Harvard hanging over my head.  I won't risk it.
Wayne Gretzky.
It's off... I can't take the fighting, the back-stabbing, the open hostility. We're not acting like cheerleaders, we're acting like a bunch of sorority girls!
You sure?
If you don't - can you still afford to go to Harvard?
She thinks you went to the police.
Spit from your dad?
Y'think?
I'll just ask the question myself... "Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?"
I'm sorry, Diane, but I'm not gonna watch my dreams fade away 'cause the Virgin Mary here thinks she's gonna get ideas from kiddie movies --
We were told you could "fix us up."
Hee-hee-h-wait a minute.  Hold on, now. What do we do before a big game?
That you?
Kim-Lo?
I-I'm sorry - can someone else please run the Ouija board?  It's creepy, it's wrong and it goes against the teachings of my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
Maybe we can make a deal.
Hold up, hold up.  Any sentence that starts with "at church camp" ain't leading to the big "O."
Hey, I even took my parents' foster kid money.  Phillipe's gonna have to gather rice without pants this month.
Bank branch!
All of you!
Before you?  Whoo-hoo!
Oh, Jesus Christ, Mom!  Like my life ain't a great big pile-of-shit 'cause you're in here?  Now I have to add, "P.S. My mom's a dyke" too?
In a deep freeze.
Close, but no cigar.
I'll take it.
I'm sure you'll be glad to meet Mr. Gillis.  He wrote it.
I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just don't think it's any good. I found it flat and banal.
The flashback in the courtroom, when she tells about being a school teacher.
Maybe that's why it's good. It's true, it's moving.  Now why don't you use that character...
Drop that attitude.  Here's some- thing really worth while.
Phillip, you're mad!
You'll be waiting for me?
Life can be beautiful!
You don't know how glad I am to see youl
You did?
Sorry if I crossed you up.
So long.
We're engaged.
I think so.  They're on location in Arizona, shooting a Western. I'm free every evening, every week- end.  If you want, we could work at your place.
Nobody can be that busy.
Are you kidding? Because I think it's good.
Don't you sometimes hate yourself?
Who's who?
I gave her some advice on an idiotic script.
What were you -- a child actress?
I just don't.
He wants me to come on to Arizona. He says it only oosts two dollars to get married there.  It would kind of save us a honeymoon.
I don't want it now.
No, no! I haven't heard any of this.  I never got those telephone calls.  I've never been in this house ... Get your things together. Let's get out of here.
Hello, Mr. deMille.
You know, crazy things happen in this business.  I hope you haven't lost your sense of humor ...
I'm not worried.  Everything will be fine.  The old team together. Nothing can stop us.
We'll be working again, won't we, Chief? We'll make our greatest picture.
It's a good script, isn't it?
I knew there was something wrong with them.
That's where the popcorn business comes in.  You buy yourself a bag and plug up your ears.
Get out!
Only asking.  I did't know you were planning a comeback.
Right now?  Never let another writer read your stuff.  He may steal it.
Maybe it's a little long and maybe there are some repetitions... but you're not a professional writer.
It certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil.
You can stay here.
Thanks for the invitation, but I have my own apartment.
Just a scene I cut out.
Not now, my dear.  I'm playing three no trump.
Can't you wait till I'm dummy?
I've lost my car.
I don't need a tuxedo.
Careful, it's slippery.  I had it waxed.
Just follow me.
It's those feathers.  They tickle.
Come midnight, how about blind- folding the orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on Max's head?
I own three blocks downtown. I have oil in Bakersfield -- pumping, pumping, pumping. What's it for but to buy us anything we want.
Has it ever occurred that I may have a life of my own? That there may be some girl I'm crazy about?
It sure would have made attractive headlines: Great Star Kills Her- self for Unknown Writer.
DeMille is Leo.  I'm Scorpio. Mars has been transmitting Jupiter for weeks.  Today is the day of greatest conjuction. Now turn around.  Let me dry you.
I'm not just selling the script. I'm selling me.  DeMille always said I was his greatest star.
So he said it quite a few years ago.  So what?  I never looked better in my life.  Do you know why?  Because I've never been as happy in my life.
Yes, I am, Norma.
It's yours, Joe.  I gave it to you.
Oh.  sure -- if it would make a good scene.
Go on in.
Madame is waiting.
It will never make house Beautiful. I guess it's O.K. for one night.
Thanks.  Say, she's quite a character, that Norma Desmond.
I sure turned into an interesting driveway.
Good.
We have to be very careful.  No sleeping pills, no razor blades. We shut off the gas in her bed- room.
I don't know, sir.  Madame made the arrangements.
It's about a ball player, a rookie shortstop that's batting 347.  The poor kid was once mixed up in a hold- up.  But he's trying to go straight -- except there's a bunch of gamblers who won't let him.
More or less.  Only for the end I've got a gimmick that's real good.
Look, Mr. Sheldrake, could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself, as a personal loan?
Now, now do you belive me? I told you deMille would jump at it.
Certainly it's important.  It's important enough for Mr. deMille to call me personally.  The idea of having an assistant call me!
This is the staircase of the palace.
It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do with three.
The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near .
Sorry, mistress.
He will be. In about five minutes.
Yes, of course, it was foolish of me.
What do you want?
I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski.
It's a warning, that's for sure.
It's for your own protection.
I'm taking you to the hospital.
Why not ?
It seemed that way to me.
Hmmm?
I did.
This "love" of yours will soon wear off. I gave you a temporary love potion.
You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid you don't know who I am.
Yeah.
Better eat it quick. It won't look too pretty when it's all covered with ants.
Nice to meet you.
Well, Lucy, it's nice to see you're feeling better. Nice to meet you, Jimmy.
-- Planet. I mean, you were there. Do you think it was natural, or like some people are claiming, supernatural?
How do you know?
Lucy! Be serious. We could be executed for  treason!
Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're attention.
But Kara, no one has ever gone from here to Earth. The journey is dangerous.
I don't understand.
Can you create life?
You're not...an orphan are you?
You sure?
Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight.
I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both be sorry.
It's everywhere. But water is always the door.
This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you come here from Argo City?
Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?
Told you. Wouldn't listen to me. Knew it would make you sad.
Of course, my dear. What can I do?
It's Selena. I'm getting so I can recognise her work.
First the supplier couldn't find the invoice. Then the order came up short. Then I missed the four o'clock plane from Cleveland and had to rent a car, and then I got a darn flat tire on the highway! Can you beat it? Boy, your boss must've been furious when I didn't show up by the end of the day today, huh?
Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
There's no vodka in it.
Brad.
For a guy who was lucky to be water-boy on the high school team, you sure got a big mouth, Kent.
And here I am, just standing here. That's terrible. Thank you.
Sure, Lana, I'd love to.
It sure is.
Who?
You thought that?
But all he had was chocolate milk.
I meant all the choices here. All this --  -- cole slaw, guacamole --  This is some picnic!
No, thanks.
Me too. That's why I put this one up.
Mom and I do this all the time.
What!
We get together sometimes.
Sure.
Actually, that's why I stopped by. He's realy sorry, he wanted to make it, but then he...ran into a problem.
I'd better be. Suddenly I've got competition to keep up with.  Your high school reunion article. I though it was terrific. And fascinating.  Especially about the girl back home.  I'll tell you what, Clark, I'll take you to lunch and you can tell me all about it.
Yeah.
Don't call me a bum! I ain't no bum!
Plants. Plants always make an office cozier.
Decaffeinated too?
Columbia.
A very wise man once said...I think it was Attila the Hun... "It's not enough that I succeed. Everyone else must fail."  And you are going to do it for me.
Yeah, yeah, I can do it.
First question got to be "Where."
Just the man I wanted to see!
Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?
Fair's fair.
You designed it?
Gus, it seems we are talking state-of-the-art technology here. We are talking unlimited power. We are talking "get-down hot-cha daddy-o" whatever you called it.
Exactly. Stoned mother.
Yeah, sure.  Ain't nobody gonna stomp my electric train...
Don't make me talk, please. I got enough problems just hangin' on.
Watch out for them air pockets!
Sister! I'm his sister!
We've already met.
I'm in no rush.  So what do you have in mind?
In other words, push this red button.
You've got to pick three more numbers.
Missing????
Where did it come from?
We can get to work on that oil!
Don't bet on it!
Yeah. I'll check.
She'll be fine.
Haven't you heard? There's an energy crisis.  No, this was good enough for my mother --
Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers.
That's because you can hardly see through those things.
Don't fake me out, Clark.  Or whoever you are.
Listen, I've got to give you credit. Your disguise is nearly perfect. I mean, if you fooled me, and I am nobody's fool --
Maybe you wanted to.
Your place?  Maybe I should change,  Maybe you should, too.
Let's get you inside . . . .
I don't want a bodyguard. I want the man I fell in love with.
But what can you do? There's no way now . . .
Oh, hi.
Never closed my eyes.
Please don't tell me "You'll find somebody else someday." Cause . . .  . . . well, you are a pretty hard act to follow, you'll have to admit that.  Oh, I'll get by, don't worry about me.
Take it easy. Take a deep breath.
Lois, I really don't see why --
Look at this! Snow. Ice.  Your idea of a good time.
It' s fantastic! ----- This place is genius.
What'd he say before? He saw a girl?
How the hell would I know? I was in high school back in those days.
Superman's got something up his sleeve, that's for sure. We just haven't figured it out. Isn't that right, Miss Lane?
Oh! That black box in our cell?
Like it? It's magnificent!  Not that it couldn't use a woman's touch. Especially around dinner time.
Are you kidding? I knew it all the time. Did you see how they fell into our trap? Beautiful . . .
Put down Lex Luthor?
Now I shall have the Son of Jor-El as my slave! Forever. If not, the millions of earthlings you protect will pay for your defiance.  Beginning with this one.
In return for a guarantee that we will not launch an attack an them.
		DELETE IN CUTTING
And so I was yesterday. And the day before.
"Super-sucker . " For once, Lex Luthor was right.
Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line.
No ... Metropolis is a confusing place. Back in Smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple. People would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand.
Don't worry, I've got you.
Clark. . . !
Let's sit down. They walk to the table. LOIS calls out to the balcony.
I'm sorry to see you go.
Like me?
Maybe if you'd have met who I am now, instead of the spoiled brat you met a few weeks ago, it would have been different between us.
That tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids?
Clark, it's Lois. This is the fourth message. I've left. . . Where are you ?
And what am I? A Shriner? No, If you'll join forces with me, together we can make the world safe for war profits again.
I'm sorry.
N-no...I mean...you bet.
Good. If you can see it, and I can see it, maybe some day everyone will see it.
I know Daddy. I'm worried about him.
Don't be over-dramatic, young lady. What kind of disaster could we help bring about?
One hundred percent.  And I like him that way.
. . . And  very naïve!
That's because there's nothing to figure out. Now will you please pay attention. I'm not through insulting your father.
Something . . . wonderful.
He was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . .  oh, it's a long story.
Lenny, ,you pathetic product of the public school system. Your Uncle Lex has had only one thing on his awesome mind during his incarceration . . . Destroying Superman!
Quiet! You'll make him self-conscious.
What?
This wasn't in the plan.
Ready, Uncle Lex?
Destiny.
I am master now.
Luthor, I suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you'd be far away from here by now.
Know something? You're a workaholic. A good guy 24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby. Get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . .
No, no, listen. I escaped with only one thing on my mind . . . the end of Superman.
Bunkers!
He's thirty-five years old.
We're running out of smoke.
And stop interrupting. his is the big scene.  Your finest hour! You rose to the challenge, baby! And you lost. That's the best part!
Not you.  You.  Tell me again.
I've been on the job.
No, Mom. You know I wouldn't break my promise.
I know.
No.
Oh, not really. I guess I'll just watch a little TV and --  --  unless...would you be interested in dinner?
Lois, you should see what the inside of your lungs look like.
Superman.  Pretty good name for him, isn't it?
You're not the only one.
Help! I mean  --  I can't stop saying it. Silly, isn't it  -  There's nothing to worry about. Help! See.
Sure, and let the plane crash in the middle of the city.
I didn't say a word.
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.,
Krypton? The place where Superman comes from?
Stay and listen!  Besides, it's twelve in the afternoon. This is no time to go to bed.
We just take it?
Ready.
A night on the town instead of under it?
Not exactly. But it's his kind of neighborhood.
On the salary he pays me, I can't make my rent without it.
All of us.
Guess I'd better hitch up the rig and come back to get that...that thing he was settin' in. What do you make of that thing? Martha? You listening?
-- as we will be.
A million years behind us.  Jor-El, he's only a baby.
How good it felt!
Let's just say I'm a friend.  And watch yourself from now on with those things, Okay?  I mean if the good lord wanted people to fly he would have given them wings.
I came to talk to you.
You think they're strange?
Thirty-five.
Uh-huh.
Only when somebody shoots them at me.
Very much.
Well, I was born on a planet your scientists don't know too much about. It's in the Xeno Galaxy. Or it was. It was called Krypton. That's K-R-Y-P...
Yessir. Just what you wanted.
You mean bullets and fire and all that can't hurt him, but this kind of rock --
Oh, Mr. Luthor...
We'll see how fast I can fly.
How are you?
He used to work with you.  Until you found out he was having an affair with your wife.
I'd heard that.  But she's well?
Which clinic?
Sunnyridge.  That was a long time
That's where I'm going.  To see her.
I didn't know.  I was in a panic.  I guessed she'd been bitten by an insect, but there was no doctor. The nearest hospital was forty miles away, and Zoe was continuing to swell.  Klara took her in her arms and tried to breast-feed her, while I dialed the hospital.  I finally got a doctor on the line.  He sounded young, but cool.  He was confident, but there was a nervousness.  He have been an intern.  This was the first time he ever had to deal with anything like this.  He wanted to seem like he knew what he was doing, but he was just as scared as I was.
Nicole, I'm just going to pack all this stuff and give it to the church for charity.  Don't feel bad. Unless you feel strange about wearing it.
Because I was driving behind the bus, Mary.  Because I saw it.  I saw it happen...
It does concern me.
Why not?
Well I don't want a damned thing to do with it.
I'll help pay for Nicole, if that's what you're really talking about. I'll even give you the money I got for my kids.  That's what we used to do, remember? Help each other.  This was a community.
Billy, that's too early.
Can't you make it later?
It's natural.
Risa, I serviced that bus.  At the garage.  There's nothing wrong with it.
You think that caused the accident, Risa?  That it brought bad luck? Christ, it sounds to me you're looking for a witch doctor, not a lawyer.  Or maybe they're the same thing.
What do you mean by that, Dolores?
Did he have any particular problems that you knew of?  Financial pressures...run-ins with the law...
You talked about it?
Berry-picking.
What's that, Dolores?
I did.
Mrs.  Driscoll, if Billy Ansel does not volunteer to say so in court, I will subpoena him and oblige him to testify to that effect.
What other people?
Hi, Dolores.
Well, it's certainly what you'd call interesting.
How long has Dolores been driving that bus, Mr. Otto?  How many times has she steered clear of danger? What went wrong that morning?
We had a terrible winter last year, didn't we, Sam?
I feel like a princess.
No.  What's this lawyer business?
It's the truth.
Did he say what about?
Rats! They fought the dogs and killed the cats, And bit the babies in the cradles, And ate the cheeses out of vats. And licked the soup from the cook's own ladles, Split open the kegs of salted sprats, Made nests inside men's Sunday hats, And even spoiled the women's chats, By drowning their speaking With shrieking and squeaking In fifty different sharps and flats...
Yes.
What, Mason?
The people in the town?
You hate that.
What do you want me to do for you, Mr. Stephens?
The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame.
You seem very sure about that.
Was the bus on time?
Did there come a time when the bus turned off Staples Mill Road onto
Thank you, Nicole.
She...she was a friend of mine.
There's the Prescots...
I'm calling because I've got some news for you, Daddy.  Some big news.
You always think you know what I'm going to say, don't you?  You always think you're two steps ahead of me. The lawyer.
I need money.
You don't believe me?  You don't fucking believe me?
I love you, Zoe.  I'll be there soon, and I'll take care of you.  No matter what happens.  I'll take care of you.
What is it?
Is there shrimp on it?
If you could pick the shrimp off, as well as anything that touches the shrimp...
You can't come here.
You've been retained?
Their child died, and they got a lawyer.
It's my belief that Dolores was doing exactly what she'd been doing for years.  Besides, the school board's insurance on Dolores is minimal.  A few million at the very most.  The really deep pockets are to be found in the town, or in the company that made the bus.
Mrs.  Otto,  there is no such thing as an accident.  The word doesn't mean anything to me.  As far as I'm concerned, somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner.  Some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar out-of-court settlement.  They decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference.  That's what's done, Mrs. Otto.  I've seen it happen so many times before.
No.
Any criminal record?
Yes.
Before the actual accident?
The speedometer.  And it was downhill there.
Just the way Dolores gets so excited about bringing the kids to check out the animals.  It's like the biggest thing in her life.
Don't even try to remember.
It's okay.
But you didn't lose me.
Well, okay.  I'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning.  That's okay with you?
It's compensation, Leo, for the marginal life we lead.  Sidney, did you hear the story about the cloak-and-suitor who -- ?
Oh, are you a spy for the other side?
Hitler!
I thought you might have a faint idea of how this item originated.
And with ten percent of his future, you're great, too, Frank.
And, instead, he printed his heel in your face?
Give me a chance --
Hurry back.
Right now you're in no position to ask questions!  And your snide remarks---
No, I don't care about you -- you're fantastic.  My whole interest, if it's not too late, is in Susie...and how to undo what you've done to her...
No, I'm not.  I'm not!
But that wasn't your fault, dear, what happened to Leslie.  I've told you that a million times...
I haven't said anything yet, J.J., but if -
J.J., Steve isn't...
No...
No.  I'm going home.
Bonna sera, commendatore.  Come sta?
She mighta jumped.  Love suicide?  Check it for me, Phil...it's a real heart throb.
I don't believe it.
I have a message from your sister.
You print them, don't you?
I didn't say that, J.J.
I like Harry, but I can't deny he sweats a little.
I'll listen one more minute.
Are you finished?
I like that, too.  Look, J.J., we can wrap this up in one neat bundle, addressed to the dumps - to oblivion.  We're going great, but please play it my way. I cased this kid. Know his ins and outs...He's fulla juice and vinegar, just begging for some big shot like you to give him a squeeze.  Do little Sidney a favor: squeeze! - You know, J.J. - the porcupine bit - needles.
Sure, he steams her up - wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz!
I call him the boy with the ice cream face!
- He's got them on him.
Go out with DIFFERENT girls!
And why should I bribe the woman who holds most of my heart?
But, Sidney darling, the man must be out of his mind - it was only eleven o'clock in the morning!
Can you be there by two-thirty?
Hello.
And he's a perfect stranger to me.
Listen, you need him for a favor, don't you!  And so do I!  I need his column--tonight.  Didn't you ask me to do something about your job?  Don't you have a kid in Military School?
Next time I'll call in a guy to paint silver stars on the ceiling!
It isn't.  I've just seen the early edition.
Help me with two minutes of silence!
I hate to see you like this --
Take a top coat.
Nothing...
Well, I'll tell you what - excuse me for breathing, will ya?  How do you like it?  He comes to my office and -
- and I just had to drop by and tell you how great I thought you were.
Who could love a man who keeps jumping through burning hoops, like a trained poodle?
Frankly, yes, to my surprise.  He thinks he's very gifted - those boys'll go a big mile, he thinks.
But I don't need an uncle, Sidney.
I'm sorry about Steve, not myself. I'm even sorry for my brother.  To be so lonely, without one real friend in the world - to have to hang on to a worthless rag of a girl like me because she's his only real family -
I'm not a man, Sidney, I'm -
I could almost forgive you if what you did to Steve came from jealousy and love...
Please, Sidney, I can't stand this -
But he isn't going to like this, Susie.  And he makes you nervous, not me.  No, I take that back - he makes me nervous, too.  But I wouldn't give him a second thought if not for you.
Steve, dear, please forget all of this.  What can it matter after tomorrow?
And on Tuesday - Hasenpfeffer. STEVE  How do you think I realized I love you?
But I don't care about that now. He knew what he was doing today. He was laying down the conditions under which he MIGHT consent to our marriage - if I would bend to every whim of his, like Sidney!  I couldn't do that, Susie...
That's right!  There's no way I'm going to finish the new processor now.  Forget it.  I'm out of it.  I'm quitting Cyberdyne tomorrow... I'll sell real estate, I don't care,,,
Shut up!  SHUT UP!!  Motherfucker!  It's all your fault!  IT'S YOUR FAULT!!
Now listen to me very carefully.
I'm a cybernetic organism.  Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.
You are targeted for termination.  The T-1000 will not stop until it complete its mission. Ever.
No.  Only an object of equal size.
Negative.  The T-1000's highest probability for success now would be to copy Sarah Connor and wait for you to make contact with her.
That is one of my mission parameters.
Cool.
No problemo.
No.  I have to stay functional until my mission is complete.  Then it doesn't matter.
Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway.  You get it?
No problemo.
I don't care.  We've gotta stop her.
I couldn't... oh, God.  You... came here... to stop me?
I love you, John.  I always have.
Don't quit, Sarah.  Our son need you.
There's not much time left in the world, Sarah.
Open the goddamn door!
Unknown.
Please continue...
Relax now, Sarah --
On all what?
Eating is eating... and...
Some.
I guess it's possible.
Why not show Dr. Furtwängler the evidence. It may refresh his memory?
With more what? More what?
David, I don't understand a thing about you. You're a Jew. Are you a Jew?
Then you're going to kill me.
Yes.
Three months.
My father was one of the officers in the plot against Hitler. They arrested the plotters and their families.
Do you know where the Adagio begins?
I did not conduct at at the rally, I conducted on the evening before the rally.
I may have, as... as I said, I simply don't remember.
They were Jews, they had to leave. They were right to leave.  I could not leave my country in her deepest misery. After all, I am a German.  I... I stayed in my homeland. Is that my sin in your eyes?
Yes, a despicable human being. He was in the Ministry of Culture. His job was to get rid of Jews in the arts.
He told me to be careful as one of Goebbels' men was watching me. He read a report on me - everything I said was quoted word by word.
The birthday greetings you sent to your old pal, Adolf Hider.
Yes, von der Null.
You sure you didn't call one of your close buddies and say, God in heaven, did you see what that guy von der Null wrote about me? The greatest conductor on earth. I want him out the way. He had the nerve to accuse me I am not playing enough modern music. Send him to Stalingrad. Isn't that what you did? You don't like criticism, do you, Wilhelm?  You surely didn't like them saying there was another conductor who was better than you... Are you saying the name von der Null was never mentioned in your talks with Goebbels?
It means I wasn't good enough to be a first violinist.
Do you know Hans Hinkel?
Do you know what's in this archive?
Helmuth.
Exactly.  Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case.
So. You wanted to see me.
Who's he?
Yes.
Sure.
Jeez, and I never heard of him.
They said I was dogged?
First oboe.
Then how do you explain him being made a Prussian Privy Councillor?
Brave?  To celebrate Hitler's birthday with some heroic piece by Wagner but without the Nazi salute? Bravo.
You're late.
You know your weapons, buddy.
That guy's a jerk.  I did you a favor.
Great.
You're a big help.
I hate the beige one.
Look, Reese, I know you want to help, but...
What?
Okay.  Talk some more.
About where you're from.
What's that?
Tactically dangerous.  We lay low.
Yes.  And I don't want to know where you got it.
I was thinking, there's so much I've got to show you when we get through this. It's mind boggling, the pos- sibilities...Disneyland, the beach, movies...matinees with popcorn and foot-long hot dogs...
No.  Never.
Pain can be controlled. You disconnect it.
Who is in authority here?
Alright, Ms. Connor.  Listen carefully.  You're in a public place, you'll be safe 'til we get there.  Stay visible. Don't go outside or in the restroom.  I'll be there in a few minutes.
Okay.
Six shots at less than ten feet.  Weapon was a large caliber--
I already did.  No answer at the door and the apartment manager's out.  I'm keeping them there.
Shut up.
Now, look...
Hm?  No, about a year ago.  I was working out of Los Angeles.
Then, you kiss his ass.
Please, don't do that...
It was an accident.
I said I was sorry...
Don't explain.  Fuck off.  Goodbye.
I don't know... he fell.
He's turning blue!
What... is... happening... ?
I don't understand why they're getting you involved.
You're a grown man.  I'm not responsible for you.
Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars?
Wha... ?
No cops.  I've got a warrant out. Mail fraud.  They'll take me in, but you won't be able to prove anything else.
What are you talking about... ?
How many times have you done this? I'm interested.
Whatever kind of nickel-and-dime shit you did before, this is more than just me.  Your friends raided pension plans, and payrolls... they took just over six-hundred million.  You ruined people's lives.
What do we do?
I'm back from the dead.
Who's responsible?!
... what... ?
Where'd you get that gun?
Just... wait.  Just wait!  Okay... please, I'm not kidding anymore...
I saw them kill him!
Stop talking...
Single?
Boyfriend?
Elizabeth?
"Consumer Recrreation Services." What, do they make golf clubs?
I'll call them, okay?
Shhhhhhh.  Wait... wait...
You think I know?  I paid them <u>more</u> to make it stop.
We're going to figure this out.  Get a grip on yourself.
Stop it!
Oh, God yes please.  Thanks, man. I'll take you up on that.
Of course, Nick...
I hope.
What is?
A game?
And if nothing's lacking?
I can't tell you how <u>not</u> interested I am.
Okay.  I think he's into some sort of new personal improvement cult.
Ilsa... you're alright?
There's been a break in.  Lock this door and stay here.  Don't move a muscle.
He came to my mind recently, that's all.
Was he morose, or...?  I mean...
Because, if you don't know about society, you don't have the satisfaction of avoiding it.
I wouldn't mention the following, except he was very insistent.  It's obviously some sort of prank...
Nothing else?
You're joking.
You warm my heart.
Greetings fellow insomniac.
It's not Victorian, everyone thinks that the whole nineteenth century was Victorian.  This is gothic, this is English Craftsman, this is Romanesque.  This is... insane.  Who lives here?
Who's Watts?
Is this true?  I've been hypnotized?
Greetings.
Do we still get paid for the week?
Nah, you're going crazy with doubt, all of your mistakes are coming back up the pipes, and it's worse than a nightmare. --
And that will be a good place to end this study.
For an American you do a good imitation of the British at their most apologetic.  Pardon me.  Excuse me, sorry, sorry...
I got more scared.
Why?
What?
Good.
Yes.  It's perfect, isn't it?
There were no children.  Rene died, and <u>then</u> Hugh Crain built all of this, and then he died. His heart was broken.
Every day.  Basically we'll be hanging out together like we have so far this evening.
I'll take her with me to the University tomorrow.  I can't believe I read the test wrong.  I didn't see anything that looked like she was suicidal.
Nell, what do we do?
She was unhappy.
No one will come any nearer than that.
You, too.  Happy tossing and turning.
You know it wasn't a joke, Theo.
I guess.  Oh, your hair!  It looks good.
Two sets.  I don't know.  Maybe they're not even his.
Maybe you did it yourself.
-- What do you think?
Because I don't want to ruin things.  Because home is where the heart is.
I'm loyal to things that make me happy.
Well, you're certainly not a person.
No.  You're not specific enough to be a person.  You're more like a vibe.
What kind of food?
You demand to be served.  A fork fetishist.
Oh, god.
I'm sorry.
Sure.
Okay.
What shit is this.  I just do it.  I don't prepare it.
There's been some trouble downtown.
What the papers used to call a "gangland slaying."
Heavier than that now.  But are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story.
We'll find him.
You could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here.
There's already gonna be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons.
Let him break - he likes to break.
Yeah?
No reason.
It was better than a telegram.
I'm just sayin' -- it was a steep hillside.  There was no moon that night ...
I only asked.
Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they.
Sod that.  Gotta get back before my probation officer wonders where I've skived off to.
Fucking out of order, that.  Shouldn't be allowed.
It's only insurance.  Can't be too careful.  This Terry Valentine, he's probably a wonderful fella.  They were together how long?
<u>Valets</u>.  They park cars.  He's having a party.
Faith.
You steady on, man.  What the fuck else did you do back there.
Yeah, I suppose.  Call 'em that, yeah. Down the boozer Saturday night.  Meet some of the lads.
Hardly buried.  Earning interest, love. Earning interest in an offshore account. Tidy little premium per annum, that.
If it played in England somebody owes me money.  Who told you that -- Eddie?
Not ashamed.
Yeah, well, she started all that in London.
Footloose and fancy free.
Well, I reckoned, Saturday night, if you were goin' out, you'd probably have to come home first.
Well, don't suppose she did, really, most of her life.  On her own after her mum died.  Aunts and uncles for a time -- and then the bright lights beckoned.
Nah, accommodation address.
Well, I gathered something from the article what Eddie sent me.  Some sort of pop music producer, wasn't it.
Proprietor of a London firm.  Of longstanding.
Have you ever known me not to be.
Depends, don' it.
You don't know how I've compromised my standards.
Still, there have been rewards.  It's sunny.  And some of the producers who call even have credits.
A jeweller's up the West End.  We tunnelled our way under the shop floor from the public lavatory down the road. Filthy work.  Trouble was, the bloody thing collapsed -- <u>after</u> we'd made the grab, 'n all.  Would you Adam n' Eve it.
Honest.  Didn't know where to look till I was 21.
I don't know -- few hours, I guess.
How do you know?
Your guess is as good as mine, mate.  I'm here on another matter entirely.
Yeah.  Shouldn't wonder.  Must've done.
As you prefer, squire.  As you prefer.
No kidding.
Right.  Chain of respect.  That's good, that.
Yeah.  Cheers, mate.
Yeah.  Another little matter needs attending to soon as I return.
Where else?
Good luck.
I don't know.
There's more than a measly few grand in this.
Like he'd never hire me for real.  Not week-to-week.  I don't have the credentials.  He thinks I'm just a sociopath, someone he can turn to when he needs "plausible denial."
Drugs?  Cash?  Both if we're lucky.
Yeah.  I know her, all right.  She came down here once, stirred up a shitstorm. We lost a full day's work, took me weeks to get back on schedule.  If she hadn't a' been Terry's woman I would've broke her jaw.  'Course, she's nobody's problem now.
What do you think?
-- You know his name is Frank.
Are you finished?
<u>Why</u> then.  Why did you do it!
Ann. Will you come in?
Yes, Ann?
A spacecraft. I saw the creatures. They led Big Dave onto the craft. He never told anyone what they did, outside of his report. Of course he told *me*. No one else.
Sometimes knowledge is a curse, Ed. After this happened, things changed. Big Dave... he never touched me again.
Hello, Tony.
Hello, Birdy.
We've certainly missed you.
Well, sure, I guess. Pop says so too. I work pretty hard at school.
Huh.
Jesus! The barber! I'll be a sonofagun. Why didn't you say so? 'Course--the barber.
No. I--tell me--
Cash.
Sure.
Yeah.
It's OK.
Awkward?! Ann'd throw me out on my keister! Hell, it's her family's store--*her* store. I serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership, Ed.
$10,000! I don't know what to do, Ed. I don't know what I *can* do. Even though I know who the sonofabitch is.
Mm.
How's that?
So?
OK. Boy. Jesus!
Check out the rack on that broad in the angora.
Oh, no. That was written by Mr Ludwig van Beethoven.
Uh-huh.
Now, being a barber is a lot like being a barman or a soda-jerk; there's not much to it once you've learned the basic moves. For the kids there's the Butch, or the Heinie...
OK.
Yeah.
No thanks, I--
My name is Diedrickson. County medical examiner.
Hello.
We're just closing, friend.
Visiting ends at five. Too late today. You can see her tomorrow.
No.
I'm in.
If you like them, they're for sale. Another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block.
Do they have to wear uniforms?
Where's the walk-in safe?
That would leave one exit for hundreds of people.  You'd be violating every fire regulation on the books.  We'll guard the perimeter with my men and engage the motion detectors in the other cells.  One more question.  I see a big hole.  If this entire thing is run by computer, what happens if the power fails?
Like hell!
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI.
Not at all.  I think we may be working on the same case.  If so, I could use your help.
Whose footprints?
Call me Vince.
I believed them.
This door's locked.  Try shooting the hinges off.
The sub-basement?
May I see that?
Got my hands full here.
All right everybody, hold up!
Dr. John Whittlesley.
I don't know.  I thought Dr. Whittlesley died in South America.
How can you say that?  You know it's not true.
My work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you.
I'm not giving up.
A blow dart.  Seed pods.  A plant press.  Pretty unimpressive stuff.
Quadrupedal!  The other name for Mbwun.  "He Who Walks on All Fours."
Read it out loud.
He's right.
They were sent to the Center For Disease Control in Atlanta.
She's never going to take us to see the dinosaurs.  That lady said they were on the fourth floor.
Chicken.  This is a great short cut.
Big as a house.
Well almost.  Depends which house.  It smelled like old hamburger, and it made this weird noise.
You're color blind.
Holy mother, what is that?
Come on.  Let's get back to the others.  We can't leave them alone.
Another storage room.
It's not mammalian, that's for sure. I think it's reptilian.
Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same strand?  Impossible.  The sample must be contaminated.
Okay.
You loved him.
You were going to be married.
Something came up in autopsy tonight.  Imbedded in Beauregard's body we found a claw.
I don't think so.  I think we were meant to think it was Mbwun.  Did Whittlesley's monster have claws?
I'm not sure.  We should split up. You take that hall and I'll take this one.
All right.  If you're positive.
We have the fibers.  Don't you see? The creature is hungry.  It wants the hormones in these plants.  It would take hundreds of human brains to supply what's in these fibers.  We're just a poor substitute.  To make it stop hunting, we have to give it what it wants.
I think... it means it's full.
I think... for the pleasure of the kill.
It's coming.  Run.
Listen to me, Pendergast.  Mbwun's DNA is part homo sapien.  In primates, the eye is a direct path to the brain!  If you get a clean shot, there's only one place you can kill it.  Shoot it in the eye!
What?
I have to shoot.
I want to book a flight to Fiji.
<i>Fiji.</i>
I'm sorry, er...the biggest one.
One.
You are a travel agent, aren't you?  "Doris"?  Your job is to help people travel.
That's right.
A window onto the human condition?
But how do you account for the popularity of those eight hours a day when Truman sleeps?
All products carefully chosen and tested by you for quality and aesthetic value.
We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented.  As the show expanded, naturally we were forced to manufacture ways to keep Truman in Seahaven - demonstrating that every venture is accompanied by a risk.
I've been tempted.  But I think it's important to retain objectivity.  I wouldn't want to get emotionally caught up.
Let's take another call.  London, England, you're on "Tru Talk."
A show - that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions.
Oh, yes.
Saturday?
Sure.  It's halogen.  Shame it didn't hit you - you could've sued.  You coming for a drink?
Are you okay?  You look like shit.
How about them?
I told you I can't.
When you were hauling chickens for Kaiser Poultry, what was the furthest you ever went off the island?
Yeah...
Gee, that's great.
--I figure we could scrape together eight thousand.
Fixing the mower.  I saw my father today.
I still want to look over a couple of things.
Good night, Mother.
I won't be here Sunday.
So why do you want to go?
I've changed my mind again.  What's New Orleans like this time of year?  Mardi Gras.  Or let's just see where the road takes us.
There's been an accident, Truman.
Truman, stop it!
Well, I made it through another night.
I've got something to tell you.  You'd better sit down.
--How do you know about that?
Tyrone, what if I said I didn't want meatball today?
You're not supposed to talk about it? Who told you that?
That the bombing in Dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen, so their deaths and the reason for them wouldn't have to be explained --
Working with?
They seemed to buy our story about the Hanta virus. You'll make sure the families are taken care of financially, along with a sizeable donation to the community.  Maybe a small roadside memorial.
We have a situation. The members are assembling.
You got some kind of business with him?
What's that?
Yeah, I had an appointment for a pelvic examination.
No. Don't bother.
No. I've been watching your career for a good while. Back when you were just a promising young agent -- before that.
I'm a doctor, but I think I mentioned that. OB-GYN.
Do you?
They want to discredit you -- for what?
How?
When we were young men in the military, your father and I were recruited for a project. They told us it was biological warfare. A virus. There were rumors about its origins.
I think you know. The timetable has been set. It will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. When our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country. The President will declare a state of emergency, at which time all federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA, Agent Mulder. The secret government.
Something's gone wrong -- something unanticipated. Go back to Dallas and dig. Or you're only going to find out like the rest of the country, Agent Mulder. When it's too late.
I've been using you?!
I told you -- he and I were old friends --
Did you find something?
I think they have that covered.
What happened to playing a hunch?
It's locked?
-- Mulder! Get in the car!
I was until about an hour ago.
I don't know. But I have a hunch what you're going to find here isn't anything that can be categorized or easily referenced.
That I don't know. But if it's through simple contact of blood to blood, and if it doesn't respond to conventional treatments, it could be a serious health threat.
That's the first question to answer, if we're going to find them.
This is great. This is fitting.
I don't believe this. I don't fucking believe this.  Y'know, I've been here... I've been here one too many times with you, Mulder.
Pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night. Chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope, only to find myself standing right where I am right now: at another dead end --
Something's wrong...  I'm having -- lancinating pain -- my chest. My... motor functions are being affected. I'm...
And they want to blame us?
Where's Scully?!
I'm not taking any chances.
I have answers for you.
Yes.
A weak vaccine against the virus Agent Scully has been infected with. It must be administered with ninety six hours.
What do you mean, walked?
I thought it only fair you should know, given how hard you've worked.
Driver.
What about you?
I'm sorry. My grandson fell and broke his leg.
No one believes Kurtzweil or his books. He's a toiler. A crank.
A pocketful of rye...
Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened...
And he might blame you for terrifying him.  That one moment could erase all you've accomplished.  And if that happened, the trust he has in you is gone.
Okay.
He needs to be turned over.
Okay.  Let's assume he wanted you to find him, that some part of him hated what he was doing... Most likely, that part is dead.  Schizophrenics with Whalen's Infraction sever all ties with the real world.  I'm sorry, I really am.
What did you see?
What difference does it make...?
Yep.  Eloped.
I got it.
No problem.
Mocky-Lock.
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman.  Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
Just graduated law school.  Single mom. Had a two-year-old daughter.
Delano?
Stargher is in custody.  The functional equivalent of being under arrest. Normally, we'd Mirandize him, and if he didn't lawyer up, we'd interrogate him. But because of his condition, he doesn't have the capacity to waive those rights.
I'll get her...
No.
No.
Yes.  But you're going to sit down right now.  I have to...
Federal Bureau of Investigation, ma'am. We know all, see all...
Awaiting his arrival.
Now?
Pregnant.  Thanks for asking.
Next time, tell me, okay?
Das mussen sie doch wissen. Ich meine ohne grund wird die politzei doch nicht ins Hans komme Fraulein Schmidt, ein schande...
Give her some cigarettes.
Yes.
Well, if I do find out something, can I look you up again?
The police. They're searching my room. Sie mussen doch wissen.
The Russians would claim me. I come from Czechoslovakia.
Sssh. Don't. Don't, please.
Need we go through it all again?
Comedy. I don't play tragedy.
What's the matter?
What are you going to do?
Be sensible - tell Major Calloway.
Why?
A parrot...Let it go.
He told you, didn't he?
Hide? Can't a fellow have a drink?
I shall be all right.
Why should he help me like that? The Russians will only make trouble for him.
You won't learn anything from them. They are only love letters. There are not many of them.
We loved each other, do you mean that?
I don't know.
I don't...
Just around the corner.
I'll carry a copy of one of your books. Harry gave it to me.
This is forgery. It is very clever.
Yes.
No.
Could you buy me one. I haven't got any Austrian kroners. Thanks.
What?
Well, you could say that murder was part...
Calloway - I'm English, not Irish.
As soon as I get to the bottom of this, I'll get the next plane.
How about the doorway?
She's right. It's none of my business.
You all did.
Well, there's not much time.
I'll look it up for you.
I'll tell you what, Mr. Martins. On Wednesday night at our institute, we are having a little lecture on the contemporary novel...I thought perhaps you'd like to speak.
Nonsense. Your novels are very popular here. Aren't they, Sergeant?
Listen, Mr. Martins, if you'd agree to be our guest, we'd be delighted to have you.
Certainly.
It is, and I'm gunning just the same way for your Major Callaghan.
Talk to me?...Of course...Come on...
You can get somebody else...
At the end of every chapter --
A Roumanian.
What's the good of another post mortem? Suppose you dig up something - well - discreditable to Harry?
Yes.
In great pain?
Must be some mistake.
Why didn't they bring him in the house?
Now, hold on.
What else?
He didn't want to get involved.
That Harry was dead before you got him to that statue.
A novel, Mr. Martins?
A friend of mine offered me a job here.
Yes?
Richard. Hi.
I'm really sorry but I just arrived; I'm on a pretty tight budget myself. I just can't afford it.
Just take it, OK.
Traveler.
I don't think so.
We moved rooms because of him.
Yeah, OK. Forget it. We won't tell anyone.
We're ok.
I'm sorry.
What happened?
Was there a shark? Did you see a shark?
We swim.
Sshh. Etienne will be angry if I wake him. He thinks I waste film taking photographs of the sky.
If it's too far, then we'll drown. But if we don’t try then we'll never know.
Woman bites chicken leg, turns out to be a mouse. Or a rat. It's an urban myth.
The Zionists aren't Nazis.
They sound like you.
He's an asshole.
That's a movie, you moron.
Yes.
Fire...
You gave fifty thousand to that college magazine.
You're a Jew. Maybe you don't realize it, but you are.
Disease? What disease?
I guess. His parents are. He doesn't care about that.
That's stupid. Why would they?
Then how come you're talking to me?
Oh, yeah... 
You shouldn't.
Shit...  Did you talk to your mother today?
Nothing.  Why are you doing this?  I thought God didn't exist.
You gotta get out of here.
I'll go look....
Did you see how they reacted to him?
People hate Jews. Do you agree?
Isn't that what we want? Germany all over again? Only done right this time...
A week or so. There's something I want to do here first.
I've been waiting all my life for something like this.
No... Yeah, fine, go ahead... So what's this about? Is this about me?
German. Mine, too. So who do you think's given more to the world, the Germans -- Beethoven, Goethe, Nietzsche -- or the entire continent of Africa? Ibos, Bantus, Mandingos...
What??!?
I don't know. Is that right?
Why?
Female...
He has Israel.
Do you know who you're fucking with here?
Yeah, and what are you? A <i>Times</i> man? A Presbyterian? Impotent? A prick?
The arguments, anyway.
A forty-five.
You're lying.
I can't say that.
I want you to say kaddish for her. It's the only thing she asked from us....
I was going to ask you the same thing.
Lina... It's happening. Tonight.
I just came to get some stuff. I'll be out in five minutes.  He doesn't want me around.
Then he couldn't be bitter about living alone.
Oh, he decides? Hitler's the chief rabbi now?...
Who told you that?
No, it's weird, man. Nobody knows where he went.
You said they didn't have night guards.
Just do it.
No, no... Not that kind of... underground. More a private... business. Private.
I can tell....
The Nazi's killing his kid. He could've jumped the guy. He could've gouged his eyes out, grabbed the bayonet and gutted him.... What would you have done if they were killing your son?
And that's when the Mets started to stink.
Valentine...
They're not that Jewish.
EAT SHIT, ASSHOLES....
What kind?
Like a popsicle.  They're keeping him on a stick until spring.
Yes!  The notary is a phony.  He has the same signature as the contractor!
Remember when I went to Italy and canceled the policy on the new stadium.  Well, we weren't being cheated by the Mafia or anybody except maybe by me...  ... Do they come for lunch everyday? I really went on my own business, to see a man that I happen to be in love with... and I'm glad I did it, but I'm sorry about the policy and I'll be happy to make up the money the company didn't get... of course just now I don't have...  One million, four hundred and ten thousand dollars.  But if you were to dock my salary, say, twenty dollars a week, in a few hundred years we'd be even... and I think this is where you fire me?
No.  He's French, he was just in Italy for the competition.
It's the Free Diving World Championship.  I am by the way world champion!
In a lake.
Congratulations.
I get it, Enzo you were a superior child.
No.
Yes, the Mamma is is there.
Enzo!
Because he won't understand and it will just hurt you... Jacques has been put on earth by complete mistake.  And he's only waiting for one thing:  that some God up there will turn him into a fish! How long has that moron been down there?
The fool was asleep!  If I weren't around, he'd already be dead!!! Is that who you want to live with?
What does that mean?
You shouldn't even carry cigarettes on board!
No...
Yes, I know.
Because I'm sure you're dying to beat me.
No.  All you need is to want to be the best.
That's too easy!  Every time I beat a record there's always some dumbshit asking me:  "D'you know that French guy, Mayol?  He's supposed to be very good!  Too bad he doesn't compete." So, you're going to come with me to Taormina! First, because you're my friend and second, because you don't have one reason to keep on spoiling my pleasure.  ... I'll see you there...
You don't have a room?  Paolo?  What did I just hear?  I personally called you to reserve a room for my good friend Jacques Mayol and you treat him like a stranger?!
Not only is Jacques Mayol a very special friend, but he happens to be one of the best divers in the world!  And you're throwing him out!  Are you crazy, or what? Stupido!
How do you make a living?  Your experiments, does it pay well?
... You married?
... And his friend, Johana...
... For the mermaids.
Everything about what?
Because pasta should be eaten "Al Dente".  So the trinket will just have to wait a bit.
... Yes.
Enzo, don't be angry.  I was lucky... that's all.
Long enough to die.  Listen, if you really want to die, that's your problem, but don't do it under my nose, okay?
... both.  Did I just see a man in a red suit and goggles?
I guess... But you know... I'm American and I've mostly been taught to be competitive... There's always pleasure of being the best?
You... You wouldn't want to spend the day with me?
I did?
Uh... Ah!  A story?
No... tell me.
I didn't dive.
I'm putting you on the coin... Your essence... That way you'll always be with me when I dive.
I saw how it has to be.
Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127 years.
What?
I brought Johana to meet you.
Well... here.
It's my apartment.
The whale!  How could I forget? Always was something fishy about that woman!
Louis, we were French!
Nice... Very interesting... Great!  ... I guess.
Haven't you been listening?
Do you think I should have stayed? Don't you think maybe I should have stayed?  I've been a jerk, right?  I should have stayed!  I was supposed to be in love... I was in love!  I am in love, why did I act like a bitch?  He went swimming. All the man did was go swimming! I must be crazy.  It was too good to be true.
They're paramedics.  They wait at 180 feet.
His mother's an American.  He spent half of his life in the states. I'd try English if I were you.
I got the job done didn't I? I did what I had to do.
You mean you want us to make copies of Yentl, Fiddler On The Roof, and Chaim Potok's The Chosen?
I love her sir. If I don't help you, I won't be able to make her my wife. Mohammed Ali Paula Abdul Rahim has agreed to come with me to the North Pole on a rescue mission.
What do you want me to do?
Please, call me Mordechai.
Sorry I'm late. Traffic was a pisher, and I've been circling the block for the past half hour looking for parking. What are you listening to?
Actually, his days of marital infidelity have long since past. Now he just shtoops my mother exclusively.
He must be behind that curtain. Relax. We're undercover. We need to give off the appearance of calm. You see Esther, the trick to undercover work is to try and blend in. Act as a Gentile would.
Yeah, no kidding.
Now we wait for Santa to make his next move.
I said, do you come here often!?
Kiss me you Semitic stud!
Oh, she said that, did she? What else did Mommy Dearest have to say?
Relax Morty, I think your mom is wonderful. She cares so much about you. Get this, while you were gone she said she'd help me get you to work with the JDL if I'd come eat by you once in awhile. Like I needed any incentive to be with you. She's so...
Mordechai!
Mom, why don't you put that cat out of its misery?
Well I'm just glad you're safe Bubba Shaina, and eating by your mother for Shabos.
Mazel Tov!
...I'm not finished yet, mom.
Happy Hanukkah Morty.
I'm just calming the kiddies.  There's no need to worry about Santa. He's just having a peaceful, adult conversation with his nice Jewish friend, The Hebrew Hammer.
Hah! Jewish guilt. Well, it won't work on me Hammer. I'm too strong for it.
Oh, that's the beauty of it. These are free samples.
Worse.
Drink your beer and don't get so excited.
What about me?
They all say the cat killed this second girl.
I'd like one of them to say it to you, Charlie. I'd like to have you hear his side of it his reasons. Want to hear them?
Let's get in your truck.
Yes, I was drunk, Mr. Manning.
You found the leopard!
That's the place: I remember -— My feet were so darn sore, I couldn't make it -- and Galbraith went on up to the head of the canyon by himself --
What are you doing that for?
Go on -—
Maybe not - cards mean different things different times --
When you are going to see Pedro, does your heart beat until you tremble?
She's a local. When the dudes come out to New Mexico, they went to wallow in Latin glamour. This is a bad town for blondes.
I know. I know. You've got the talent. I got the breaks.
I want to ask you something.
More or less.
About Charlie's leopard?
I don't know.
To know where that leopard went - — I'm afraid you'd have to be a leopard and think like a leopard. I was a naturalist. That hardly qualifies me as an expert in hunting down lost leopards. I used to teach zoology in a little fresh—water college back East. I gave that up.
There's a little museum here in town. They've hired me to run it, We've some interesting exhibits of Indian arts and crafts. It's fun -- and I like living here in New Mexico.
That was a calamity!
I know all that, chief, and I don't like it any better than you do, but there's something else --
Let me get one thing clear. Did Galbraith make a direct accusation?
Why?
And I never will- you know what's between us — we're a thing But this is serious competition.
I thought -— is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance  this town will never forget.
And I never will -- you know what's between us -— we're a thing -- But this is serious -- big competition.
The red dress?  No. My black one. Then I'll be just like him.
And I suppose you don't feel bad!
I don't know —— a witness. He seemed to know something about animals -- you know -- expert testimony.
You remember the fellow this morning -- Galbraith. You've got time before the supper show.
I know. Funerals.
Maybe I want to feel badly.
That's funny -- I never knew you to lose that much before --
Dial O-O-O on the telephone if you change your mind about the drink, sir.
I don’t know. He seems to delight in so much sisterly love, he might become determined.
Disney! How inter...
You... You found that at Leon’s?
Excuse me?
Where is it?  He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he?
The question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything, Mrs De Moraes.
Perhaps I should come back when you’re...
I was hired by your parents, Mrs De Moraes.
Last night you upset my sleep. Tonight my social life. We have two minutes. My dinner guests are waiting.
You could say that. And Friedman left this morning for Los Angeles.
Well, I found a little more than that. Let me put it this way:...  Last night I thought your brother might be dead, tonight I’m convinced he is. That said, I have no evidence and I advise you to let the police deal with it.
Uh... Wait a moment, Mrs De Moraes...
Aren’t you curious to know about Friedman?
I guess the news you’d sent me after Friedman didn’t go down too well, eh?
You knew he had nothing to do with your brother’s disappearance, didn’t you?
I take it you learnt to live with yours then. Take it all the mind-dulling pills in your medicine cabinet are surplus to your well-being...
If-if my car is there, I could be the one who... Why don’t you accuse me of killing my brother?
You seem to know what you’re talking about.
He... He is dead!  MY HUSBAND IS DEAD!  Call my parents. They’ll tell you. Call them!
You wouldn’t understand.
A call box? That’s odd. Where exactly?
Not in America, sir. You must be from Europe.  So, black coffee and a couple of crescents.
I don’t smoke. If you could get to the point...
Yeah.
No. A poor little rich boy who thought he’d save a few kids from their retailer. He disappeared on his second shopping expedition.
I know where to look.
Hah... What about Nathalie?
Thank you. But I think I’ll go to bed. It’s been a long day.
Yeah. Goodnight, Emily.
Have you found your man? Is that where he is?
A seminar in a baby breeding farm! Bodies in acid! You think I’ll get anywhere with that? Jesus! With luck I might raise a laugh. They might even send a patrol car to check the place out. Whatever, it’ll be too late.
It’s up to you whether they walk or not.
What about your friendly cop?
And losing you, we’d lose him. And that would be a shame, don’t you agree?
You... Fuck you!
Who?  Martin... He’s Martin...
What kids?
The company. We all work for the company.
I don’t know. I don’t know, man. I don’t even know Friedman that well... I...  Man, you’ve got to get me out of here...
Another hotel. Down the road. Martin lives there. He took your money. He’s got a safe...  I need a doctor...
B-Black...
How are you, Jane?
Should I?
That are called Rommel or something, I guess not that many. 
Oh yeah! Better be good and hurry away then! Who knows? We might be being watched! Maybe one of your stupid French companies has got a detective prying into your life - after all, that’s what they do to their employees, isn’t it? Huh! Hope you enjoy ruining people’s lives. Thanks for the lift!
It’s not.
Your secretary, huh!
Really? And how are you, eh?  Someone called Pierre Dreyer said that a month ago he had dinner with a Brazilian friend of...
Spitz. We spoke on the telephone.  My husband...  My daughter, Deborah, whose house this is.  My son-in-law, Carlos...  The gentleman is a business partner of his. 
Look Mrs Spitz... I don’t know to whom I’m indebted for the recommendation but... I’m not in the business of making oaths of allegiance or giving myself character references. What I do is listen to what the people who care to call me have to say and judge whether or not I can be of help. I hope you can appreciate that, Mrs Spitz.
Do what, Mr Lombard?
He could indeed, Mr Lombard. But had he done so I think he would have let us know about it.
When... I’m told he came here...
We conclude our transaction.
Look, I don’t think you’re fully aware of what you’re playing with here, Mister. Whoever put you up to this either pays too well or misinformed you. Why don’t you just tell me what it is you want so we can do business in a civilized manner, eh?
Shut up and drive!
Huh. I’d have thought a tough guy like you would know better. The sick ones are out there, friend. They make up the clientèle. Get rid of them and we’re out of business.
We need a double-room and as I understand you’re here alone we’d be much obliged if you’d agree to move to a single room...
Have you?
I’ll be alone.
Did Leon tell you why he didn’t want the police involved, Rhian?
Good reasons?
Yes...You-you’re not going to take Shiva away?
He... Apparently the hostility was all hers. Leon didn’t... It hurt him. They used to be close...  Their parents were in their forties when they were born, you see. And mostly away. They grew up in a Scottish mansion with old nannies and servants. He... “Our world was so old and cold, we shone for one another,” Leon used to say. His sister cut him off after she got married. He never understood why but thought it was because she had no children. Was bitter...
How’s the boy doing?
Would you know where I might reach her?
Fucked-up fucking weird.
Alors quoi?
A l’achat, trois ou quatre mille. En location, cinq cent. Mais ça pourrait faire plus. Je ne sais pas. C’est pas vraiment mon truc.  I don’t know any Austrian, Xavier.
Let me give you a tip, asshole - no one pulls stunts like what you pulled in London and here tonight and hopes to get away with it. It upsets people. It’s wrong. Fucking wrong.
Huh! You turned him into a liability, didn’t you know?
If he had, you’d be dead.
Two stiffs and a missing kid followed your visit to one of the London hotels. He didn’t need your confession...
Their last suspected kill occurred two years back, though your Spitzes now probably do no more than bankroll the group. Still, I’d watch my step. These people are well-connected, Laurent; former Israeli prime minister, etc. The lady’s also president of an international Zionist organisation... Anyway, you get the picture.
Cost what?
I don’t know. Could be the sound of jewellery hitting a parquet floor, huh?
Tremoille... don't.  Please...
How dare you tell me what God tells me to do!
Uh... they said... they will think about it.
Jeanne, you've been badly wounded...
Well...
Jeanne, no...
So... what am I supposed to do now?
Me?!  It's not me, it's God who makes everything complicated!  If he's all-powerful, why not let the English stay on their island in the first place?  And why let this war go on for a hundred years?  And why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family?  Why, why?!
Jeanne... I believe in you... more than anyone...
You listen to your voices, I listen to my heart.
He said that... he's making a treaty with the Duke of Burgundy and...
Did your voices tell you that?  You told me you hadn't heard them for months...
It would not be the same without you.
Not yet!
I want to stay with you...
Yes yes... any moment... you're always so impatient...
Sound the retreat...
I don't remember.  Maybe.
To hell with procedure!  We paid a bloody fortune for this slut, and we can do whatever the hell we like with her, whether the church likes it or not -- is that clear?
... and your prerogative is to find her guilty...
Scared of a girl?
I'm on the side of our Mother Holy Church.  Besides, a confession under torture will never convince anyone of her guilt.
What about you?
Your trial, Jeanne.  On a charge of heresy.
Yes.  In the church at Domremy.
Yes...
It's not my body I want to save. It's my soul.
Buying her?
I understand.  How much?
You really think she's been sent... by God?
Tremoille, I'm not even king yet... who'd want to assassinate me?
... to ensure our privacy.  I need to talk to her.  Alone.
If there was, I didn't see it...
Go and ask him yourself.
I know... but the English want her very badly, and I have to tell you that they are proving much more generous.
I must offer to the Duke.  I will give you his answer tomorrow.
Everywhere.  Where is the food?
I know...
For what?
You may have been with your counsel, but I've been with mine, and I'm telling you, God's counsel is wiser than yours, and he's telling me to speak to the English -- now!
Jeanne, you have to understand -- it's not easy for us -- I mean for our pride -- to suddenly be usurped by a -- well, with all due respect, by a... girl.
The wind will be against us...
We need another ten minutes...
Not yet.
Yes, it's a miracle.
I don't think.  I leave that to God. I'm nothing in all this, I'm just the messenger.
I... submit to Our Lord.
That's now what I meant...
No!
Jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous...
A few teeth... that's the price of his life?
Yes... a half-steed... white.
No... no... I'm just a messenger... He needs me... a higher calling...
I don't know -- I don't care anymore -- I just want to be at peace!
I don't understand.  What do you want from me?
They're going to come and visit you in here?
Because!  Because I've always been faithful to God, and I've followed everything he said... and I've done everything he asked me...
Like... like the wind... and the clouds... and... the bells... and what about that sword lying in the field... that was a sign...!
But... it didn't just get there by itself.
Why are you doing this to me??  Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
I never took pleasure in hurting anyone?
Yes... of course... when you don't need me anymore.
... to love your enemy as much as you love yourself?
Oh yes, my sister's just... she's... wonderful.
I feel safe here.  And it's where I can talk to him.
Well, I try and talk to him, but mostly he's the one who does the talking.
Jeanne, be patient.
Yes.
A singer. Her husband's an actor. I knew them well. Good people. I'd like to talk to her.
Oh, yes. I remember.
Dorota.
I'm sorry - I was given this address. I'm looking for a Mr--  -- a Mr Dzikiewicz.
Just over a year.
Christmas.  This is not a good time to have children. But then...
What are you doing?
Let's find out.
How will we sleep?
I'll be fine.
What's happened?
Oh my God, it's terrible, you've got to do something, oh my God!
They're hunting people on the streets. They've picked up Henryk.
What?
I haven't seen him.
Tough luck.
Then there's nothing I can do. He should've joined us when I gave him the chance..
Your work, yes, playing the piano for all the parasites in the ghetto, they don't give a damn about people's sufferings, they don't even notice what's going on around them!
We use what?
No. Three hundred and sixty thousand, so it'll be easy.
Well, you know what's funny? You're funny with that ridiculous tie.
You're out, aren't you?
You're mad, that's your trouble, you're mad.
You have to have an employment certificate to work for one of the German firms in the ghetto, otherwise...
'If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?'
I don't know why I come here every evening, it's always such bad news.
Toilets?
Wladek! How are you?
Fine, we're fine in the circumstances. But I can guess what you've called about. There's nothing we can do; they won't reopen the station--
Pack, Wladek, there's no time.
Stop it, Wladek.
No, I don't think so?
I was... I was trying to open this tin.
In the attic.
Don't thank me. Thank God. It's His will that we should survive. Well. That's what we have to believe.
I've got another one.  Warmer.  What will you do when it's all over?
Yes, like a cave.
No sound at all?
There is something to be said for silence
Ohh the tag is broken.
On your property?
I'd like to make a swap.
The piano.
I don't want to learn.
I'd rather not play. I want to listen and learn that way.
I just want to listen.
She says, throw it overboard. She doesn't want it. She says it's spoiled
It's my mother's piano.
You've missed this bit.
Who told ya this guy was in here?
Right through there.  But I wouldn't go in there if I were you. 
What's the line on Visitation?
At the finish, it's Single Action by two, Fasanella second, Visitation third.  Line on Single Action... 3 to 2. Hell with it, that's no good.
I got a hundred bucks for you and your friend if you deliver the money for me.
Here.
What?
What are you talkin' about?  We just took off the biggest score we've ever had.  We can do anything we want now.
Hey look.  You think I'm gonna run out on ya or somethin'?  Just cause we hit it big.  Luther, I owe you everything.  If you hadn't taught me con, I wouldn't know nothin'.
You'll take a cut of what I make, won't ya?
If that's the way you want it.
He's not comin' in.  Not to get bounced off a job anyway.
We had a few problems with the Law this morning.  The Mayor promised the Jaycees to get tough on the rackets again, so he shut everybody down for a couple hours to make it look good.  Nothing serious, it just put us a little behind for the day.
Which way did he do, Eirie?
I did.  That stuff I gave him was counterfeit.  They'll pinch him the first place he tries to spend it.
I'm busy, Floyd.
Which one?
All right, mark Mottola up a little and put him on a bus.  Nothin' fancy, just enough to keep him from coming back.  Get some local people to take care of the other two.  We gotta discourage this kinda thing.
Who's got the contract?
Yes sir.
You've only been playin three hours, Doyle.
Does J.J. know how to use this thing?
I picked something up on the way.
You didn't act much like you wanted to learn it.
And a packing company, a chain of Savings and Loans and half the politicians in Chicago and New York. There ain't a fix in the world gonna cool him out if he blows on ya.
I never played for winos.
All we need is a couple days, Henry. A couple days and we'll get Lonnegan down and stomp on 'em.
Just a little nervous, that's all.
If we're lucky, this'll bring him back stronger than ever.
That's what I like about these guys, J.J... They always got protection against things we'd never do to 'em.
Nothin' yet.  I got a good one on the lead at Hialeah, but he's fadin'.
Then you'll have to come up with another grand somewhere.
What for?  I haven't done anything.
Yes, a ticket to Chicago.
But I got a train to make.
Where's June today?
Sixty-five.
2:00 A.M.
You know me.  I'm just like you... It's two in the morning and I don't know nobody.
What the hell's the matter with you. We coulda met at a club or somethin'.
I feel lucky tonight.
Three grand on the black, Jimmy.
He cheats.
Then why the rat?
That's worth fifteen grand to ya?
I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time.
I am after this race.
You got a system, Carver?
Not yet, but...  Hey, there's only a grand here.
You want your money back?  Try and get it in a court of law.  C'mon, don't be a sorehead.  I'll make it worth your while.  Migth even help ya finance the big play if this one works out.
He's right, Les.
How am I gonna do that?
No.
If it works again tomorrow, I'll have a half million in cash here by noon the next day.  We split 60-40.
Never heard of the place.
He was?
You know how they are... sex...
Just a minute...
He's just around the corner.
That is, if it's all right with you.
Don't cry.
Dorothy!
It's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.
Now do you believe me!
Yes.
was fascinated with you....  a real live detective....  You used to tell me the most wonderful stories.  Were they true?
No.  The lawyer -- I'm going to see him.
Hello, Nick!  And a party - celebrating father's third murder - 
Forgive me.  How are you?
You see how much we have to say.
Where are you going?
And he still wants to marry me!
Only in bad weather.
Goodbye, my boy.  Take care of Dorothy.  Show her that there is such a thing as a happy marriage.
He said that father's in town. He's been seeing Julia right along.
Gilbert!
Children, will you go into the next room? I want to talk to Chris alone.
We hear this is getting to be sort of a meeting place for the Wynant family, so we figure we'll stick around in case the old man himself shows up.  Then we seen him...  ...sneak in and we decide to come up.  And pretty lucky for you.
I'm asking you.
Man to man, I'm not.
Oh, that's a phoney.  The men didn't even have to go down.
She's ready to talk.  It won't do any harm, though - to find out where he is.
Fifty will still get you a hundred.
Oh, then you did hear from him?
He did!
Well, thanks.  We'll call you when we need you again.
Goodbye.
A brown suit, brown shoes and a white shirt and a grayish tie with red, or reddish brown figures on it.
Let him have his say out.
Good morning, Lieutenant -  Sorry.
Looks like he planned, something. He shut up his apartment and his shop.
Just what I said I'd do.
Never mind.
So I see.
I do wish you'd tell me where you're going.
Never mind.
I trust you.
You might do that.  Get me a ticket for...  No, you don't!
Mimi?  ...  Oh, Dorothy's mother.  Does she have to be up to something?
I haven't been a detective for four years.
My wife's father died and left her a lumber mill and a narrow guage railroad and a couple of other things.  And I'm looking after them.
What's all the fuss about? Is he in hiding?
How do you do?  What did you say?....  He is?.... Where is he?  Very well.  He's back in town....  Wynant.  Thank heaven.  He's waiting for me now.  Forgive me, Mrs. Charles...  but I've been so upset.  It's no joke working for a man like that.  I must be off.  Goodbye....  Goodbye,
I hate to bother you when you're laid up.
Slim.
Oh he as clever about that.  He called when you were out.  That same afternoon, Julia telephoned to him. She said that you were coming, Mimi, to ask about Wynant. He got terrified. He was afraid that Julia would break down and tell... so he went to Julia and killed her and left Wynant's watch chain in her hand.
Yes...
I've got some very important news - I've seen Wynant.
You're lying, Mimi.  But then, you'd do anything for money.  You're getting a good price for saying you saw Wynant and you figure you won't get anything if he's dead.
He's well-trained.  He'll behave himself.
Much better, thanks.
That last Martini.
Too bad you didn't bring your whip.
Yes.
That's jolly.
They were kidding you.
At breakfast.
Well, quick -- get into bed.  Are you all right?
I'll get some towels. 
Well, didn't you?
I'm going to take Asta for a walk.
We're going sightseeing -- aren't we, Asta?
Looks like a hold-up!
I've got hunch.  I'm going down to look at Wynant's shop, I want to find out why it's closed.
He went away lots of times when I knew him - but he never closed his shop. I've got a hunch something is up.
You wouldn't be a widow long.
Goodbye, darling.
I did find him!
That's what they think... Guild and all of them.  They take it for granted that it's just another of Wynant's victims.  Guild's hot-footing it around now, looking for Wynant. That's all that troubles him.
Several things.  Hello, Fred.  We're hungry again. Yeah, and lots of onions.  Oh, and coffee.
Couple of months anyway.
Hey... hey.  Don't do that.
Got a nice evening dress?
Oh, they'll come.  I'll have Guild issue the invitations. 
Mimi, Jorgensen, Morelli, Tanner..... 
Let's see... where was I?  Oh, yes.  He went to find the man. That man was desperate!  He knew that he was caught dead to rights -- and with prison staring him in the face, he took the only way out. He killed Wynant.  It's terrible to tell you this way but your father's dead, Dorothy.
After our hero had killed Wynant, he got a brilliant idea.  He realized that he and Julia could still collect money.  Wynant was supposed to be on a trip - no one knew where - so our dinner guest wrote letters to Macaulay, signing Wynant's name, so that Macaulay would continue to send the money to Julia.  He even telephoned Macaulay --  Do you remember?.... the first day that you came to see me... he telephoned that he was in town?
Police!
You shouldn't let that keep you from telling truth, Mimi.  Mrs. Jorgensen -  Were you ever divorced from Chris Jorgensen?
Yes.  Nick!
Maybe she has.
Two weeks work gone for nothing.
You did.
Y-yes.
It's a fortune box.
There you go, Jaeger.  Just find the buried treasure, and you're a millionaire.
Maybe that's all the Iraqis could afford, okay?  Maybe they got it on discount. Maybe the fuse is messed up.  Or maybe it's going to go off in two seconds, and we won't have to worry about getting Jaeger down off there, all we'll have to worry about is finding the pieces.
You just go when I say go.
We can't just go off and--
Probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here.  Worn down to nothing now.
Let me see the map.
What am I supposed to do?
What about the gold?
You said he was a deserter.
He's an enemy soldier.
I've got no stomach for murder.
What if I do?
Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.
And let me guess who is.
What about Jaeger?
It's like I said; you don't really know lieutenant John Epps very well, do you?
Blow me.  Have I said that to you guys recently?  Blow me.
I did it!  I got the box open.
We disappear for awhile.  We disappear, we came back; nobody knows nothing.
Yeah.  I meant... You know what I'm going to do with it?  I'm going to buy a Sixty- three 'Vette Stingray.  All tricked out and cherry.  I'm going to be so sweet.
Oh, that's fun.
We've got to do something.  We've got to turn around.
We run they'll shoot us anyway.  If we keep driving they might think we friendlies; Iraqis.  Or even if they know we're Americans they might get scared, think we're part of a detachment and keep on going.
It's the only way.  We drive!
Look at you, not even breaking a sweat. You're cool, boy.  You're cool.
...I know.
Faster we get there, faster we get back.
We're going to be right over here.
I said be cool, all right?  Now be cool!
Epps, my leg is falling asleep.
Me and Wes each going take an end of the rope, run our asses of, and yank you off the mine.
Wes is right.  If there were any more mines we would have found them.  Hell, that one you stepped on was probably old anyway; left over from the war with Iran.
Yeah, I understand.  Wes doesn't want to come along in the first place, but he gets a third of the find.  That's a sweet deal.
It's a fire fight.
So good bye, Shi'ites.  Thanks for playing.  We have some lovely parting gifts for you as you go.
We're not going to do anything.
Right now I wouldn't be surprised if Eartha Kitt showed up singing Send In The Clowns.
What does it look like I'm doing?
I feel air.  Probably opens up outside somewhere.  That's where the light comes from.  Couldn't see it with the lanternon.
It's giving.
What's to stop him if he wanted to?  All he has to do is cut the line...
Jesus, Jaeger.
Someone's got to send the gold up.  It can't get on the line by itself.
It should, or it will?  Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against.
We'll find our way.
Wes is dead!
What do you mean no?  They can fly us home.
Yeah.  Well, me too.
You sure you want me too?
It's a desert.  That's what deserts do at night; they get cold.
No!
The deal was no one touches it until we get out of here.
I don't have a weapon.
I just said I would.  I don't think I--
I don't know.  He didn't have a uniform on.  He...he had on white robes, like the guys who killed Wes.
We keep going, that's what we do.  We ignore them, maybe they ignore us.
With what?  Against how many?
We go this way.
But...
Thanks.
Threatened to blow my brains out?
Don't make so much out of it.  Only reason I haven't figured a way to get all that money for myself is because I've been too busy figuring ways to stay alive.  Believe me; if I had a minute to catch my breath I might have played things the way you and Wes had.  I'm no better than anybody else.  I've just been busier.
What?
Thought you were going to buy a car.
I don't know.
I could use some recon photos too.
Just...want to be ready when we do.
I'm making you uncomfortable.  Baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three-hundred-thousand screaming Iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles, that doesn't bother you.  But me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull.
I could.
I don't care if there's a lump of coal in here.  I just want to be able to rub Epps' face in it when I crack this thing.
What?
Like I said; so?
It doesn't mean anything.
What!?
This is so weird.  It's happening, but it's not.  It's like a TV show, and we're part of it.
You know what, Wes?  If you get a note from your mommy they might excuse you from the war.
It's a container.  Break the seal.
You know it's real.  You know it's real, and you know it's there.  You know it.
Yes!
If!  If there's a treasure.
A car is not just a car where I come from.  I had this friend, had this wicked candy apple red Sixty-four and a half Mustang--
Oh, God!
Oh, Jesus!
Then lets go back while we still can.
That don't mean nothing.  Iraqis could have just spread them out like that; make us think we're in the clear.
Those people down there are Shi'ites. You've got Shi'ites in the south of Iraq and Khurds in the North.  Neither of them've got much love for Saddam. Probably figured once the war started there might be an uprising, so he sent his soldiers out to slap them around some.
We make it, or we go back empty handed.
Just seems weird they didn't chase us.
He'd just slow us down, and drink our water.  And if we ran into any more Iraqis you know he'd sell us out.
You want to say some words?
Correct.  Now secure a sinex drop reading.
Permant cortex bond.
4732...?
What's the matter with you?
I have to see SEN.  I've just been given a shift change.
Now.
Don't be so sure.
It's 3+27 hundred
No....I though  I'm afraid.
But...you...
I don't know.
I've got a slip movement to install on my next shift.  I'll never make it the way I am now.
Oh, THX... hold me, hold me, THX holds her tightly, tears in his eyes.  They kiss, and LUH hides her head in THX's chest.
I'm not afraid...I'm not afraid.
THX and me.
Impossible!
Incredible!
It will be good for both of us. I've got it all arranged.
Listen to me....You have no need to distrust me.  We're going....
What?
When?.....How?
That way.
What?
What kind of answer is that?
....going well.  How could I be so wrong.  SCO 1202 cross wired a 904.  He's been receiving extra credit.  He offered me some.
Officer Reilly, vice.
Hang on.
Off a girl's wrist. A suspect...
What do you mean?
We can start in the area where the robbery occurred.
That cop who bought it... you didn't tell us he was your partner.
Mike Reilly.
Anything else I should know?
Hey, look--
Yep.
Look, it's a longshot...
Industrial wood oil. Separately, any one of these things could lead in several directions, but together ...
What not bad. You've got a series of bombs, devices, that may or may not be connected, set by one or many nutjobs, who may or may not be linked.
We've gotta be. In this business, you don't exactly make alot of outside commitments.
Your partner?
Be right back.
He has a timer going as back-up, in case we got a hold of the remote.  Okay... first, run your fingers along the edges, feel for a sensor.
Close your eyes, feel your fingertips. Tell me everything you feel.
Don't touch that.
Stay to your left.
I don't know.
It's from an IRA.
"Punks", huh?
Meg's lasagna. Good eats, Reilly. C'mon.
Thank you.
Alex-
We're moving' on. I have to pick up the supplies. Just two little boxes.
Shut up!  Who is this?
Take him!
You're vice, not homicide. Besides, you don't have the experience and you're too personally involved.
And what, you'll shoot me? Hey, don't mistake me for one of your partners, I'd like to make retirement in one piece.
Son-of-a-bitch... my nose... This fuck-up is interfering with-
Time for bed, kiddos. Say goodnight.
Fuck factor ten.
Look who's talking, old man.
Nah, let's just take a look-see.
Yeah, just a nick ...
What?
It won't work, he'll know it's a trap...
Fire me later. Close in and we got the bastard.
A man in love, completely shaken. He sits on bed, thinks, then takes telephone slowly, decisively.
No!
You see--  No, no! And <u>yet</u>--  <u>Did</u> I--did--now <u>where</u> could we have--
Goodbye, M'sieu Filiba. 
Amsterdam?
Let me tell you, Venice <u>can't</u> <u>compare</u> with Constantinople.
Good morning.  I'd-I'd-I'd like to look at some cuff links.
Now see here, my good man. I've had just about enough of your insulting remarks!
The type they marry.
Oh, yes ... Well, that's not so easy.  Beginnings are always difficult.
Um-hum. Very good. Excellent!
Yes, Baron?
I hope so, too.
No, to you--M'sieu <u>Monescu</u>.
M'sieu Monescu!
Just as you say, Doctor.
Now just a minute, Major--
No--no.
Please.  When I came here it was for a little adventure--a little game which you play tonight and forget tomorrow. But something has changed me--and it isn't the champagne.  The whole thing is new to me. Very new. I've got a confession to make to you.  Baron, you are a crook.  You robbed the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine.  May I have the salt?
Thank you.
I'm crazy about you.  By the way, your pin.
Gaston Monescu.
Last year? It can't be that long.
We'll take the Royal Suite!
Yes--Filiba! Venice--Grand Hotel-- room two fifty-three--
Spanish passports?
At twelve twenty. I know.  Lyons two, four, seven, one.  Two more days and we'd have seven hundred and fifty thousand francs more!
Well, see you at the Berlin Express.
<u>Grossartig</u>--<u>kolossal</u>!
<u>Am</u> <u>Berliner</u> <u>Zug</u>.
Yes, <u>M'sieu</u> <u>Colet</u>?
Lily-- 
Yes.
Yes.
I remember.
Not particularly.
Oh! You didn't read it!
Ye-es?
Correct!  Good night.
Good night.
M'sieu Laval, I've got a confession to make to you ...
I know all your tricks.
Because I want to make it tough for you.
Yes, Gaston?
And you expect me to believe that?
Divine ...
No, madame, it's the way you <u>follow</u>.
Yes, madame!
Yes, madame. You see, I have to get up very early.  My little brother goes to school--  You see, Mother is dead.
Very well, madame. Thank you. 
Ever had a romance with a crook?
Let me give you a little advice. When you embrace him, be sure to put on your gloves. It would be too bad if your fingerprints were found ...
The pumps --
Thank you, Rose.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
What? You have to get to a boat right away!
Take the elevator to the very bottom, go left, down the crewman's passage, then make a right.
Hurry, Rose.
You are, Lewis.  You rolling?
Rose might not want to see this, Lewis.
How it's going? It's going like a first date in prison, whattaya think?!
I put the diamond in my coat pocket. And I put my coat... on her.
You're wrong. They're fascinating. Like in a dream... there's truth without logic. What's his name again...?  Picasso.
Rose is displeased. Mmm... what to do?
Diamond. Yes it is. 56 carats.
I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me.
I'm not some foreman in your mills than you can command! I am your fiancee --
I'd rather be his whore than your wife.
What do I tell your mother?
Sure. Count me in.
Porca Madonna!! YEEAAAAA!!!
Ain't you boys ever rowed before? Here, gimme those oars. I'll show ya how it's done.
I prefer not to push the engines until they've been properly run in.
No.
You're crazy.
Well, here you are.
Uh huh. They'll be sorry. 'Course you'll be dead.
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
I see you.
Cal, surely you remember Mr. Dawson.
A mistake?
To the stars.
Could it have damaged the ship?
Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?
He couldn't have.
I didn't.  I just realized I already knew.
I'm so cold.
I promise.
I promise. I will never let go, Jack. I'll never let go.
Mmmmm. Well, I'm off. Maintain speed and heading, Mr. Lightoller.
Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day!
Don't talk such bunk! She's one of the acts on the ship. I just ran into her by accident.
You mind your own business! She's an old friend of mine and I like her--what're you going to do about it?
Yes, yes--the air--  --I'm getting plenty of air.  Miss Marsh--Mrs. Rosson.
Why worry? It was insured--how about that swimming lesson I promised you?
Sure!  Excuse me.
Oh, no--I played with <U>your</U> cards--in <U>your</U> cabin--at <U>your</U> suggestion--If you've got a kick coming, make it to the Purser.
Want to take it back?
I'd <U>like</U> to be.  Sailing on the <U>Progress?</U>
So you washed it off!
A little boy that has escaped from his nurse and--
You're forgiven if you don't make dates with anybody except me for the rest of the voyage.
Anything I can do?  I'd jump overboard if it'd help you.
Yes--is it all right if I come like this? 
I'll give you plenty of rings as soon as I get the stones set--what do you think?
Good night, idiot!
Just met her on the boat--supposed to play bridge with her yesterday--but she wouldn't--so we played poker instead.
Make it five.
Jimmy!
It'll never hurt you---Got any money?
Yes, sir!--I will, sir--Certainly, sir!
Looks like he's taking a trip--see the baggage? The only time they ever picked me up, McKinney walked through the room while they were grilling--let's see how good his memory is.
Come on--  I'll promote a card game, and we'll be sitting pretty.
Why <U>didn't</U> I think of that?--I am going to scout around and see if I can find her.
Pleasure first if it don't interfere with business.
Are you screwy?
You know where that sense of humor's goin' to get you one of these days--
See you later, Shortie--I'm off to the pool.
Hope I didn't keep you waiting.
That beats two Pairs. I'm glad <U>I</U> didn't win the first pot. Take the money, Mr. Brett.
Make it three, boys--I'll play this hand pat.
Sure, I'll go.
Hey!--you're tickling me.
It's a bet--come on, Sally!
Don't be too smart, Jimmy--you're out in the rough yourself. You had an argument with Lother a couple of hours before he was killed--but I'll deal with that later--
Now that that's settled, why not make the game a foursome?
Wait a minute--let's match for it.
I would--but our rehearsal starts right away.  Before I go I want to ask you a little favor. Sally is an important part of my show. Some day--not now--when you get a chance--let her come to just one rehearsal. I'll appreciate it.
Very clear. That's one favor I'll be glad to do you.
Back is in New York.
O.K.! Send that!
Well. I'd rather see <U>you</U> get it than the company.
Knots!
Not the <U>real</U> Chad Denby?--
<U>Nuts</U> to you too!
I thought I put you to bed.
Let me see now--Don't tell me--  You're dumber than me and I'm dumber than you. I don't get it.
Miss Marsh.
Looks to me like standard equipment for the Department of Street Cleaning--
Everything O.K.?
Like it?
Do what--
Oh, you dear Atlantic Ocean--how you spread across the sea--From New York to dear old Europe--just for boats to ride on thee--
Everyone but me--what do you want now, Mary?
So have I--I can get it right out of my trunk.
Don't blame it on the ocean!--All right, you'll get the raise!
Oh,--I was having so much fun I almost forgot--
Don't ask any questions--just give it to me.
Eh?... Oh.
Looks lonesome--Bring him over here.
It's a long trip and we'll get that sucker later.
You ran away because you were afraid. I don't want it to end like that.
Get wise to yourself, Sally--you're no sob story.
Let's see if I can bring it back to life.
Why?
Good night!
Well, of course, I wouldn't take it.
I sincerely hope so--
He's a swell person. He told me he'd rather turn one guy straight than jug a million.
What's the matter?
You saw him sitting out there in front, didn't you?
What!--are you crazy?
Telegrams.
Beauty, ain't he?
He was quoting the bible, Revelations: "Behold a pale horse And the one that sat on him was Death and Hell followed with him."
Good.  That's real good.
Crack me back of the head like Some stinkin' bull.  Hell, you Ain't no fightin' man, you're Just a cop.
Make you a deal.  My brother took Over the Marshal's office in Tombstone.  Got it in his head He's gonna make the place safe For widows and orphans.  You and Your boys stay out of his way, I'll make sure he stays out of yours.
Well... 'bye.
No...
I see, off to strike it rich, Huh.  All right, fine, wish you Luck.  Tell you this though, never Was a rich man yet didn't wind up With a guilty conscience.
Credat Judaeus Apella.

I stand corrected.  Wyatt.  You're An oak.

I laugh sometimes
Where do you get these questions?
I don't know, make some money, Have some kids, you know.
I don't know, doesn't make any Sense.  I almost can't look at You.  Like it hurts.
Josie... No, I'm gonna call you Sadie.
I didn't mean it that way.
I can't, I'm sorry.  Forgive me.
Wyatt...
Wait!
Let me have one of those cigars.  Kinda nice in here.  You run it?
Why don't you get rid of him and Get yourself straight dealer?
Sure I'm sure.  What is this?
I need it.
If I had to explain it you Wouldn't understand.  Just say We're brothers to the bone.
But this time they'll be ready.
They're wise by now.  Which is Next, Iron Springs?  Yeah, let's Try there, Iron Springs.
We'll go around that way, come up on foot.
Just his style, Morg.  Doesn't Mean anything.
I know.  And nobody can make him.
That didn't sound like thunder.
Morgan, are you crazy?  They're Out gunning for us!  What the Hell're you doin'?
Yeah.  It's a fact.
Listen Mister, I'm getting' tired-
Jack...
Sure...
Kinda, actually, yeah.  I gotta admit.
Nothing to do with me?  I'm your Brother for Christ's sake.  God, I Don't believe this.  Talk to him, will you?  Or hit him.  Oh no, don't tell me...
Wyatt, I know what I'm doin'.
Bundle up, Virge.  Cold out there.
Curly Bill, huh?  Who was that Other idiot?
Yeah, and dangerous.
- Thank you, M. But this is more than your man can handle.  Are we in agreement?
GET BOND OUT OF THERE.
I see.
Sidney, perhaps we should leave this to -
I know. Pirates from Sumatra want the cargo; smugglers from Thailand and Burma want the ships.
Where can I find him?
Ah, James. You always were a cunning linguist... Au revoir, mon cher.
Moneypenny! How indiscreet! Have you ever known me to kiss and tell?
No, 007. It's just that I've learned from personal experience - that when we get what we want -  Somehow the reality is never as... Satisfying as the fantasy.
I don't care who you dial, so long as it's not me. Next -
Don't even think about it. 007. They're my granddaughters.
Guard! Arrest these men! Escort them to the cutter!
It's on the boat. He's holding a press conference tomorrow.
Shhhhh...
Well... If you insist.
Something with an engine? Not oars?
Not if you kill us first - unless that's how you plan to leave Muffy.
Spends his nights at the Kuala Lumpur yacht club.
That's reassuring.
Jack Wade. Citibank. Commercial loan division. If you're ever lookin' for a sweet refinance on the boat -
This afternoon. Our boats practically kissed in the harbor.  James Bond.
Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.
And exactly what business are you in, Mr. Bond?
The Strait can be a very dangerous place, Mr. Bond. A few words scribbled on a piece of paper in London doesn't carry a lot of value out here. Including life insurance.
No. I want Sir Elliot to keep them.
What?
That's funny: you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection.
He was my father's best friend!
The only mistake is that they didn't kill us in the elevator.
Are you listening to me?
Don't say it.
...You know, that's another reason you're probably not in a successful relationship.
You insist on calling all the shots.  And by the way: I am not a helpless girl.
If not?
Of course.  Minister Johnstone.
'Able to topple governments with a single story' - as he says in his press.
... Didn't we once investigate Harmsway?
We serve the interests of the British people, 007. No matter who we may be foolish enough to elect.
Hopefully, it won't get that far.
Good luck on your mission, 007.
Actually, you're just in time.  Admiral Roebuck: You know Commander Bond, don't you?
It doesn't quite add up.
Is that Mandarin, or Cantonese?
I am. What do you want?
Thank you, Uncle Elliot.
Yes. Shall we kill them?
...Haven't we already paid him for his services?
No sir! I swear! This is not true!!
...But because I am a just man, I've decided to give Mr. Hussein what he deserves.
Who is it?
Meaning there may be nuclear material down there?
No, it's that when do you have time to be parents to him? You guys don't pick him up until nine, ten at night. You are into yourselves, as the saying goes. Spend some time trying to be parents. Take him to the mountains, fishing. You ought to let him get to know nature.
Why are you always afraid to get somewhere?
Maybe I can get down there next week.
Babe Brother.
This doesn't make any sense; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air.
Boy, that is the real South. That is real corn liquor.
It is just a regular card.
Anytime you need someone to do something for you, just let me know.
We grow most of our own food. The money I get from social security, my pension and my wife's work, keeps us living on the edge. What choice do people like us have.
You all act like two roosters.
You and Babe Brother are so much alike...
You're going to find yourself on the floor.
What happened to your hand?
I don't want to hear any joke about colored people being in hell. You're being irreverent.
I don't want to hear any tales about colored people...
I don't care to hear any jokes about people being in hell. This cut on my hand reminds me that it is nothing to laugh at.
Why didn't you catch a plane?
Stay until you feel better? I would like to hear all the news.
Where we come from, you had to know how to act right. You had to know how to say yes sir and no sir. You had to know your place.
I'll be right there.
Tolerable well.
You just run along. I'll fix him his soup. He will be all right.
Wasn't Hocker lynched?
You damn right they didn't, especially Emory, my cousin.
"Out of weariness, I spoke to my own heart; to leave it all and to die. And I gave my heart to know madness and folly."
He's just raffish. Harry put him up to it. Before evening sun sets, I would have his belongings back on Route 55, that old fox.
Why not? Harry says that's the only way to do good.
Don't shout!
Harry is the kind of guy you would love to take out in the woods and leave under a rock.
I want to hear what happened. My brother is a jackass and a damn fool. The both of you have been as scarce as hen's teeth.
You know the man next door is near death.
Tolerably well. I brought you some more rabbit manure for your roses.
I know you didn't but you have been so thoughtful.
Whadda ya think?
Okay...
Oh, I'm sure he's there.  You're just not looking hard enough.
Bye, house.
Well sure, look at him.  He's got more gadgets on him then a Swiss army knife.
I know Andy's excited about Buzz, but you know, he'll always have a special place for you.
Mm-hmmmmm.
Can't!  Can't!  Can't!
Oh, yeah, tough guy?!
Where?
You mean that happy child?
Then we've no time to lose!!
Sorry.
YOU are the one that decided to climb into this --
Oh, great, great.  Yeah, and if anyone attacks us we can blink 'em to death.
Shield your eyes!
Oh, you idiot!  You're a toy!  Use your karate chop action!
I can't help.  I can't help anyone.
But why would Andy want me?
Come on, Sheriff.  There's a kid over in that house who needs us. Now let's get you out of this thing.
Pardon me.  I hate to break up the staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE! Birthday guests at three o'clock!
Everyone, it's Woody!
I can't see a thing!
Heh-heh.
He's in the psycho's bedroom!
Did I get my package in the mail?
Oh no, Hannah!
Outta my way!  Here I come, here I come --
Have you been replaced?
How did I get stuck with YOU as a moving buddy?
A lunchbox...?!
Wait!  Wait!  I got a better idea! How about we DON'T?!
No, I'm not!  Buzz, come over here and you just tell the nice toys that you're not dead.
Toss 'im overboard!
Hey, these guys are professionals. They're the best.  C'mon, they're not lying down on the job.
Hey, Woody!?  Where'd ya go?
Last present!
Uh-oh.
Sid!!!
That's right.  Your toys.
Sh-h-h-h-h!!
Oh, shut up!  In a couple of days, everything will be just the way it was.  They'll see... they'll see. I'm still Andy's favorite toy.
Slink!  Hang on!
Do you know you've lovely hair, even if you torment it in those braids.
Get away from me...
He'll be looking for another apprentice.
Did you now.
What difference does <i>that</i> make?
Nothing is left but us.
We're too young.
Juliet who?
He never came home last night.  Was he with you?
Arnie, thank God.
Arnie, I need money.  Somebody threatened my children.  They want a first payment of three million dollars.
Please.  Tell me who Carl sells to.
I need an introduction to the Obregon Brothers.
Carl, I'm running late.  I'm coming right now --
What?
Honey, this is difficult, but we've all had our moments.  I tried --
Why?
She asked me not to.
The first thing we have to do is present a unified front.
I have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day.  That's different.
Will we get invited to the White House?
What is this, like freebase?
I think so.  If she didn't she should have.  I've only got maybe an hour.  Then volleyball practice is over and I have to be home.
Nope.
We got you on tape making the deal. We got you bragging about the quality. We got you bragging about your business.  We got you.
Depends who it's from.
Depends on the state.
You're kidding.  Can't you shoot him or something?
You can't visit me here.  I want my lawyer.
It's a death sentence.  I'll never make it to the trial.
So you pay off our customs officials?
No, this is not possible.  And I thank you for coming down here, though I suspect it's been a pointless journey.
You want to smuggle narcotics in Mr. Espastico Jacobo.  That's nothing new.
It should be... It's yours.  I want our debt forgiven.  I want to be the exclusive distributor of Obregon Brothers Cocaine for the United States.  And I want the principle witness against my husband, Eduardo Ruiz, killed.
That's crazy.  My husband is on trial for smuggling.
Your new friends.
We thought maybe you'd have that kind of information for us.
I feel like a traitor.
What is it you want me to do?
Only if he can be trusted.
If I ever return to the bench, Counselor Adler, I hope I have the pleasure of hearing your arguments.
Just tell me where she is.
The West End.  We buy it off the streets.  I can stop, you know, and she can't. Two people, really similar, we can talk about anything, but for me it's like a weekend thing, then I get my shit together, and for her it's different --
Addicts treat themselves... they overdose and then there's one less to worry about.
What kind of research?
Because I fucking told you to do that, you doss cunt.
Sorry, mate, I'll get you another.
Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
Too right it is. Now look, have you got anything to eat, 'cos I'm fucking Lee Marvin, by the way.
I've no fucking cigarettes.
Jesus.
I'd fucking kill you.
Not sorry enough for being a fat cunt.
It's where I live.
And don't make any noise.
And that's what's illegal. Do you know what they do to people like me inside? They'd cut my balls off and flush them down the fucking toilet.
Are you clean?
Calm down, I'm just asking. Is that hash I can smell?
Unless you get caught.
Now?
Oh, really?
Mr. Murphy, do you mean that you lied on your application?
Aye.
What do you mean?
So who else?
Give me the gun.
No, he didn't make me touch it.
And I got a stitch stuck between my teeth, jerked my head back and the whole fucking stump fell off.
I got a good price for it. Rents, I need the money.
It was just an idea.
About four kilos. So he tells me. Got drunk in a pub down by the docks last week, where he met two Russian sailors. They're fucking carrying the stuff. For sale there and then, like. So he wakes up the next morning, realizes what he's done and get very fucking nervous. Wants rid of this. {---------- He's looking for Swanney to punt it, but Swanney's nowhere to be seen since he lost his leg. ---------- }
Yeah, well, it surely worked for him.
He knows a lot about Sean Connery.
As you wish.
Such as?
No, not homeless people. Beggars, Francis Begbie -- one of my mates. I wouldn't say my best mate, I mean, sometimes the boy goes over the score, like one time when we -- me and him -- were having a laugh and all of a sudden he's fucking gubbed me in the face, right --
You doubt me?
All right, we're lost.  But we're making good time.
Position, Bird of Prey?
DO it. Go to Red Alert.
I apologize for canceling shore leave, but look, we have a dangerous situation out on Nimbus III.
The same. From what we can make out, a terrorist force has captured the only settlement. And they've taken hostages.
With all due respect, the Enterprise is a disaster. There must be other ships in the quadrant.
Oh, please.
The power was within you.
I hope it won't come to that, Mr. Scott.
Head down that tunnel to the hydro vent and turn right. Then left at the blowscreen. You can't miss it.
Put it on the veiwscreen, would You please?
Captain, we're receiving transmission from Paradise City. They're demanding to know our intentions.
Go, Sulu.
I'm flattered. Twelve hundred points of interest in Yosemite and you pick me.
Because it's there.
Perhaps "because it is there" is not sufficient reason for climbing a mountain.
I don't understand.
I was trying to comprehend the meaning of the words.
Yes, Spock?
Go to sleep, Spock.
Goodnight, Bones.
I cannot be certain.
Who is it he reminds you of?
Yes, Captain.
An eternity during which we'll be vulnerable to Klingon attack. Korrd-you tell him.
Worse. I have betrayed you. I do not expect you to forgive me.
If you think it would help.
I have a half brother.
Is what possible?
But the center of the galaxy can't be reached. No ship has ever gone into the Great Barrier. No probe has ever returned.
"c."... "k."
The only problem is, it's up there. We're down here.
Hmmm?
I believe we are witnessing my birth.
Sybok, listen to me. In order for this craft to enter the landing bay, Enterprise must lower the shields and activate the tractor beam. To get us inside and re-raise the shields will take-
Now learn something about yourself.
The ship needs its Captain.



Uhura, I had the strangest dream. I dreamt that a madman had taken over the Enterprise.
It was not my intention to amuse you. These are serious charges. However, if you surrender now-
I cannot go with you.
I don't understand..  Reveal yourself to me!
This is my doing. This is my arrogance... my vanity...
Tried to.  Can't quite make the connection with that sucker, though. If I had a direct terminal ...
Okay, okay...
You call that getting over it?
To warn him.
I'm certainly not.
Yesssss. Yes. Yes. Yes.
Right on the money!
Let's get outta here.
It's our friend the boy detective. He's nosing around again.
End of line.
The MCP is the most efficient way of handling what we do. I can't sit and worry about every little user request that --
Tanks...coming back. Let's go.
Wrote the...?
Probably decided not to pursue us, The Sea of Simulation is tricky.. lot of illusions...rough navigating. Programs have a way of just... disappearing here.
Why? What are you going to do?
Shhhhh.
How 'bout yourself?
We're inside a Recognizer...  You are crazy -- stealing a Recognizer --
Little more juice's all it needs...
You're getting out of the business?
Strategic Air Command.
That's right. He pushed me...in the other world. Somebody pushes me, I push back. So I brought him down here ... What's the matter, Sark? You look nervous.
Then pull yourself together. Get this clown trained. I want him in the Games until he dies playing.
We'll get them, sir... These things take time.
We have to.
That's all going to change, Yori...
Don't know yet... I have to get in touch with Alan. He was going to tell me how to
As long as it gets us out of here
It's something Users do.
I'm shocked.
Girlfriend, you got a man.  You				* just have to take control .  . .  set up the right mood.						*
Just an hour?  You should tell this stud to take more time.
Great!  You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.
Yeah, Dad.
I'm not a pumpkin!  Okay?!!  Do I look even remotely like a pumpkin?! I'm not a muffin, or a cupcake or a honeybear either! And you don't understand anything Dad...
Fine.
Sorry, sir.  Uh... here's what we got.
It's Talkradio.  You're on the air.
What?
Here, check these out.
What?
No way.  Not Dana.
Will you just open the door!					*
Nope.  The art buys are in a separate ledger.
Yeah, right.
See, that's the problem with terrorists.  They're really inconsiderate when it comes to people's schedules.
Gonna try to get a closer shot of				* Beavis & Butthead.							*
Goddammit!  That's outrageous.
Son of a bitch!
You want me to just hang-- ?
Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting.
It can't be.  Not Helen.
I'm giving her an assignment.  I am offerring you a choice.  If you work for us we will drop the charges and you can go back to your normal life.  If not, you will go to federal prison, and your husband and daughter will be left humiliated and alone.  Your like will be destroyed.
... the Coast Guard has to clear them back to a twenty mile radius.  Anybody that can't make the minimum safe distance we need an airlift on, immediately--
It's show time.  Don't look at					* the flash.  Do not look at the flash.
Ten, Mr. Gibson.
Yes sir.
That's right.  They want something...  dramatic.  I spoke to a number of people who said you're the one to see.
You're damaged goods, lady.
Yeah, it was wild.
I slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks.
I'll handle it.
Yeah.  It was great.
It sounds wild.  So now you're a big hero, right?  For fixing their system.
Well, maybe a little.
No.
Answer the question--
Yes or no.
The code name of your contact will be Boris.  Your code name will be--
You wouldn't believe me.
Ask me a question I would normally lie to.
Yup.										*
Yes.
Sure.  Set me up and then don't tell me.
Isn't that hard to keep up, in the long run?
Samir is just going to ask Harry a few questions.  See, we're not even sure which agency Harry works for.  Now, Samir is absolutely first class, but on the other hand we have Harry, here, who has managed to lie convincingly to the woman he loves for 15 years.  So it will be interesting to see how long he can resist.
I'm sorry, I can't.
Not here.  I'll call you and we'll rendezvous again.  We have to leave separately, so we aren't seen together.  For your safety.
I'm married!
I don't know.  I have to think...
Use the gifts that Allah has given you.
He can't. We gotta go, but he wants you to read the letter. The letter explains it all. He wants you to know he loves you. And he wants you to know that as of tomorrow, all of your money problems are over.
I thought Sonny was the good guy.
Well, it's just when I see a really good movie I really like to go out and get some pie, and talk about it. It's sort of tradition. Do you like to eat pie after you've seen a good movie?
Would you like to get some pie?
How 'bout me what?
What do you want to know?
And in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?
That's where trouble comes into paradise. But the boss let's you borrow some money if you need it. Wanna see what "Spiderman" number one looks like?
What would make you think that?
You're not stupid. Just wrong.
You know, a lot of people have misconceptions of how she died.
Clarence, I've got something to tell you. I didn't just happen to be at the theater. I was paid to be there.
How do you do, Mr. Worley?
Bottom of the ninth . Mr. Worley. Oh, by the by, Mr. Worley, have you seen your lovely wife today?
No joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious, I've never had a hamburger taste this good.
Babalouey, you were perfect, I could hardly keep from busting up.
How come?
I heard that.
Nigger, back off, you ain't beatin' shit. Now what would you do.
So you do eat pussy!
Can you live with it?
Then shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs.
He don't got no right to live.
You're tellin' him what he wants to hear, but that ain't the same thing as kissin' his ass.
She's with me.
I'm her husband.
You got it.
Get the fuck outta here!
Tell him we'll be hittin' his area some time tomorrow.
Every word of it.
For the very first time in my life.  Do you know what that's like?
Tell me.
Elliot.
Where?
Don't expect me to be all broken up over poor Drexl. I think he was a fuckin', freeloadin', parasitic scumbag, and he got exactly what he deserved. I got no pity for a mad dog like that. I think I should get a merit badge or somethin'.
Let me handle this.
Yeah, let's just get outta here.
How 'bout me what?
Want an animal cracker?
He trusts you?
Sure. I didn't hear anything.
Do I look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like French vanilla ice-cream?
Then why are you telling me all this bullshit just so you can fuck me?
Riddle me this, Batman. If you're all so much in love with each other, what the fuck are you doing here? I'm sure you got better things to do with your time than walk around in circles starin' up a panther's ass. Your guy's interested because with that much shit at his fingertips he can play Joe fuckin' Hollywood till the wheels come off. He can sell it, he can snort it, he can play Santa Claus with it. At the price he's payin', he'll be everybody's best friend. And, you know, that's what we're talkin' about here. I'm not puttin' him down. Hey, let him run wild. Have a ball, it's his money. But, don't expect me to hang around forever waitin' for you guys to grow some guts.
I guess so. Follow me.
No. No you're not.
Have you read the story on Elvis?
You know what would taste good? Chicken. I haven't had chicken in a while. Chicken would really hit the spot about now. Chicken and beer, definitly, absolutely, without a doubt.  Where's a good chicken place around here?
Clarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! I can't believe how much like your mother you are. You're your fuckin' mother through and through. I haven't heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a sudden at eight o'clock in the morning. You walk in like a goddamn bulldozer... don't get me wrong, I'm happy to see you... just slow it down. Now, when did you get married?
What?
Do you still have friends on the force?
Could you find out if they know anythin'? I don't know they know shit about us. But I don't wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for sure what's goin' on.  Daddy?
No shit?
Nope.
Who is he?
That's what I've been tellin' ya. The guy was like a mad dog. So the cops aren't looking for me?
I don't see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place?
Shit, are you behind. Me and Robin got a divorce six months ago. Got myself a new place - mirrors all over the bedroom, ceiling fans above the bed. Guy'd have to look as ugly as King Kong not to get laid in this place. I'm serious, a guy'd have to look like a gorilla.
I believe he believes him.
Nicholson and I go to work on him. Now er know somthing's rotten in Denmark, 'cause this dickhead had a big bag, and it's uncut, too, so we're sweatin' him, trying to find out where he got it. Scarin' the shit outta him.
To front for him. So Elliot is workin' out the deal between them and his boss, a big movie producer named Lee Donowitz.
No way, JosÈ.
Yeah, I live here.
No, I ain't been there. But I heard him say. Hollywood Holiday Inn. Kinda easy to remember.
Are you Dick Ritchie?
No.
For a man in your position...an opportunity.
You're still a little... disoriented.
What's she doing?
It was released in Philadelphia, probably on June 14, 1995.
"James"!  Nobody ever calls me that.
You wouldn't understand.
It's the next step.  I checked out the Baltimore information, it was nothing. It's Philadelphia, that's where they are, the ones who killed everyone.  Zs that a radio?  Does it play music?
Ohhhh, that one!  Can we hear that one?
I've got one now.
And he told you then his father was a famous virologist.
I thought you didn't know how to drive.
No.  I want you to turn yourself in, James -- It'll go much better for you if you do -- but I'm not going to trick you.
First, it's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running.  Okay?
No, I want to turn myself in.  Where is he?  Don't worry -- it's all okay now.  I'm not crazy any more!  I mean, I am crazy, mentally divergent, actually, but I know it now and I want you to help me.  I want to get well...
I thought I was in...prison again.
James...do you remember...six years ago...you had a phone number!  You tried to call and...
If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.
So we can stick our heads out the window and feel the wind and listen to the music.  So we can appreciate what we have while we have it.  Forgive me, psychiatrists don't cry.
Well, you look pretty different, too.
On the walls -- they meant the animals when they said, "We did it."
I was here...as a kid.  I think you were here, too.  But you...looked just like you look now.
Scientists.  I'm supposed to report in to them.  They'll want to know they sent me to the wrong time.
In the 18th century there was no such thing!  Nobody'd ever imagined such a thing -- no sane person anyway.  Along comes this doctor...Semmelweiss, I think.  He tries to convince people... other doctors mostly...that there are these teeny tiny invisible "bad things" called germs that get into your body and make you...sick!  He's trying to get doctors to wash their hands.  What is this guy...crazy?  Teeny tiny invisible whaddayou call 'em?..."germs"!
I'm not crazy.
It's private.
You do know me.  You helped me once.
Monkeys.  Twelve of them.
I just need to have access to the pure virus, that's all!  For the future!
They gave you a pardon, man.  Whatdaya want?
Yes, sir.
I didn't think I was being defensive. I was just...
I said it was bad judgment!  What else do you want me to say?
And what we believe is what's accepted as "truth" now, isn't it, Owen?  Psychiatry -- it's the latest religion.  And we're the priests -- we decide what's right and what's wrong --we decide who's crazy and who isn't. ... I'm in trouble, Owen.  I'm losing my faith.
You really want to know?
You want to go in?  Examine him?
You want something, old man?
You can't do that yourself?
Christ!
Or maybe you just think you do.  You can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, there you are.
Think you'll live that long?
More or less.
Will be.
You got two years on me.  What's that make me?
I got more brains than you've got teeth.
Out of here.
I'm sorry, sir.  It's thirty dollars for the ticket.
You Harlin?
Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
Another accident?  You got to be more careful.
That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.
I don't know, but it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through.  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
You son of a bitch!
There you go, sweet talking me again.
It is morning.
You got beer?
Let me have a Beck's.
Genuine Draft?
Yeah, give me the Miller.
Yeah, I'll try.
Wrong number.
Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
My cup runneth over, beauti--
You sure you can manage?
Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some work there.
Did you like it; me watching you?
I guess it must.
A little of this, a little of that. Mostly I tell fortunes.
I have ideas.
No.
You need a meal ticket is what you mean.  Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
I can't.
It's not like he's a young man. He's had time to live.
Never needed one.  I've never been anywhere.  I've got a backpack.
Wait.  What about . . . him?
Yeah.  Good thinking.
You liar!  You wanted him dead.  You seduced me into killing him!
You heard me.  Count it out.
Now what?
You closed it, didn't you, Grace?
Why don't you come down and get them so I can wring your pretty little neck?
Jake McKenna.  That's a solid name.
My car overheated.  I pulled in to have it fixed.
How do you know if you've never tried?
No.
I had a problem getting my car back.
I do all right.  Real estate isn't a bad game such as it is around here. The trick is to underestimate the price when you buy it, and overvalue when you sell.  You can turn a few dollars that way.
About things.  About your wife.
About what you said this morning.
I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
That was just loose talk.  I don't want anybody dead.
I guess I have what you'd call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
Came close this time and it scares you.
Darrell giving you problems?
You thought you'd come in here in the middle of the night and wham! Wail off and clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper.
That's a thick change of heart.
You're not talking sense.
What difference does it make if I slept with her.  You don't care about Grace.
It's not me you have to worry about. It's her.  She wants you dead, Jake. She wants you dead and she wants your money.
She's dead.
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
That's not the way it looked to me. Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
You expect me to believe that?
Not before I settle with you.
You stupid punk!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
Give it to me!
I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!
I'm gonna beat you so bad you gonna be eatin' nothing but soup the rest of your days.  Rain dogs is gonna be prettier than you when I'm done. I'm gonna mess you up so bad you gonna make your own momma sick.  I'm gonna . . .
With a shotgun.  It kills him, and it shreads the money.  I mean, what are the odds?
I had to beat it before the cops showed up.  I don't have a cent to my name.  I can't even get my car out of the garage.  I tell you, Mr. Vesci, if it weren't for bad luck I wouldn't have any at all.  So, I was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so I could get my car.  I'll pay it back with the rest of the money.
Yes, Mr. Vesci.
No, sir.  And I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
Sheriff, he didn't give me any choice.  If I hadn't defended myself- -
Is there a problem up the road, Sheriff?
There's nothing in the trunk, Sheriff.
You want something, old man?
You can't do that yourself?
I said I was sorry.
All right, old man.  Christ.
So, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
Things ain't always the way they seem. You got to ask yourself: is it worth it? Day comes Earthmaker is going to look in your fucking heart! Then you better know what it is you're doing. <u>Are you a human being</u> -- or just one of them hungry ghosts out there floatin' around?
'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off, somebody gets hurt.
Stand up.
Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this.
Give it to me!
Bobby Cooper.
Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.
I did?
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
You love her, but you hate her?
How do you want it?
Oh yeah sure. Why don't I buy you a plane ticket right out of here while I'm at it. I <u>know you</u>...  This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her.
I know you're not surprised I'm back here, cause you can read my mind and all.
It's not what you think, Jake.
It's the truth, Jake.
Maybe I don't like being played, like she played us today.  Maybe I don't like that at all, Jake. I'm just pissed enough, maybe I'll rip the neck off my own grandmother.
Two-hundred dollars...I'll do it!  I'll kill her!
You're too quick for me.
I hate to bust your bubble honey, but I wasn't defending you.
Nope.  Darrell.
He's up at the Look Out.
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
I don't have a goddamn credit card.
You've been there?
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
I don't give a fuck! I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
Well, that key's not gonna work. I had to pop the lock. You didn't leave me the trunk key.
When I work on a car, I work on a car.
Eh?
Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.
Maybe I don't want you to.
It's Grace.
You should be more careful.
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways. I should have parked closer.  I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package?
I just drove in this morning.
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
Thank you.
From my father.  He was the tribe's shaman.
Those are white words, not ours.
It tells me what every face tells me. Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
Nothing like a little liveliness.
You know what I want.
Try me.
Yeah.
...you could get me money. I'll get you out of here.
Oh yeah. There's nothing else with Jake. He don't trust banks. He keeps the money in the floor right under the bed. He loves it so much, he wouldn't think of spending any of it on me. I never seen it but I know he's got more than a hunnert thousand at least...
If the key's on him, how do we get the key?
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
Stop it.
I thought you couldn't get your car.
Then will you take me on your friends' boat with you?
Anywhere?
He was a <u>cop</u>, Grace, they never stop looking for you when you kill a cop...
I don't want to go to Mexico, Bobby! Please, I really want to be with you. Don't blow this. Don't you think I care about you?
My mother died in this canyon.
Can you make it back up?
And love's a funny thing.  Sometimes I don't know if I want to love you...
Right, Mr. Arkady. And that's not the half of it. I got your money, and I go into this little grocery store in this hicktown to get something to eat and then... well, it gets <u>robbed</u>!
Mexico is a large country. Where in Mexico would you like--
The ticket is 30.55.
I'm sorry.  It's just ... you know ...
More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
Virgil!  Now look at what you done!  Are you all right?
You sound just like Jake... I did see into the future, Virgil, but you weren't in it. Go back to your family. They love you.
Wrong number.
They look nice.
There's someone in the house.
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing.  We was just talking.
Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's business to take care of. I ain't never taken no drugs, mister, and ...
I want my lawyer!
Is Noel in?
Oh.
Wow.
Yes.
You've made a considerably wise decision.
I'll keep it in my office room.
What does that mean?
He's asleep.
No that's it.
Jeremy what the hell are you doing?
I had a nightmare one night and I didn't wake you up so you could tell me it was okay.  I think that was the first time.  Does that count?
I don't know Megan.
What was your idea Elijah?
I've come to understand that...  An ill advised purchase in the parking lot.
We've already begun.
Like what?
You're skill.
One last question.
The car accident you were in... Was there anyone else involved?
I never said you couldn't be killed. I never said that.
What's he look like?
Just now. They want you to come down to his school.
I won't make any noise.
No.
No.
I mean if you knew karate?
Two hundred and seventy.
Elijah was wrong.
Jeremy listen to what--
Jeremy if you pull that trigger I'm going to leave! I'm going to go to New York.
It's my field. I represent athletes. I'm an agent.
I'm meeting a player from Temple University. He's a cornerback. You like football?
Is David Dunne there?
No.
Football wasn't the kind of life I wanted... For ten years I'd be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game. And if it wasn't that call, it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion. I've seen way too much of it in my job... I can barely take it when my clients are in pain.  I don't hate the game. I admire the amount of skill it involved and, like everyone else, I was in awe of how he could play it, but I couldn't give him my heart and then have something happen to him. And it always does with that game.  It's not a thing many people would understand.
Where is it?
Ha. He was building his fucking porch.
'Course he's coming.
Little Bill? He didn't say nothing. Like I said, he was buildin' his porch. Have you seen that thing?
Don't matter, we don't need no whips.  Spring comes an' Skinny don't have them ponies, I'm gonna...
Nope.
They went out scouting when they saw your fever broke.
Three days. Are you hungry?
Your wife?
Shit and fried eggs.
I heard that one myself, Bob. Hell, I even thought I was dead til I found out it was just I was in Nebraska.  Who's your friend?
I guess not, Bob. I don't like guns around.
Enemies, Bob? You been talking about the Queen again? On Independence Day?
You figure nobody'll want to fuck her.
Huh? Hullo, Skinny. Snuck up on me.  How do you like her?
Roof? Jesus, Skinny, I done practically every damn thing myself. Roberts boy hauled wood, that's all.
Yup.
Oh, shit, Bill, I guess nobody's gonna come clear from Texas.
Uh... Duke.
Duck, I says.  "You have insulted the honor of this beautiful woman, Corcoran," said the duck. "You must apologize." But Two Gun Corcoran would have none of it and, cursing, he reached for his pistols and would have killed them but The Duck was faster and hot lead blazed from his smoking sixguns." 
Silky an' Faith, they rode off to the East an' two deputies was followin' them.
Yeah, he went South ahead of us. I guess we'll catch him before...
N-no. He... he beat him up. He was making him... answer questions... and beating him up... and then... Ned just died.  Little Bill didn't mean to kill him... he said he was sorry an' all... but he said it was a good example anyhow.
Not on purpose. But he started hurtin' him worse... makin' him tell stuff. First ned wouldn't say nothin'... but Little Bill hurt him so bad he said who you was...
Didn't scare Little Bill though, did it?
Like I was sayin' you don't look like no meaner than hell cold-blooded damn killer.
Well, Uncle Pete said you was the goddamndest meanest sonofabitch ever lived an' if I ever wanted a partner for a killin', you was the worst one. Meanin' the best. On account of you're cold as snow an' don't have no weak nerve nor fear.
Well, how about it?
For cuttin' up a lady. They cut up her face an' cut her eyes out, cut her ears off an' her tits too.
Thousand dollars of reward. Five hundred a piece.
Oh.
Wasn't nothin' said about no partner.
No.
Lookin' at?
Well... I don't recollect.
You boys are crotchety as a couple of hens.
If he gets behind them rocks we ain't gonna get him... not without we go down there.
You missed him? You didn't...?
Yeah.
You... you ain't gonna shoot him yourownself?
Yeah?
Well, I gu-guess they had it... comin'.
Lemmee see it.
I thought you wanted to buy spectacles an' fancy clothes an' all.
You sure you ain't armed?
A writer? What do you write... letters an' such?
Yeah?
Who was next? Clyde? Or was it...?
Should be easy killin' em... supposin' they don't run off to Texas first.
Two weeks, I guess.
Nor Quincy, I guess.
You ain't like that no more.
Sure, I got to. Got to get supplies.
Yeah.
Kid? The Kid's shootin at us?
How far kin you see?
What he was talkin' about... how them deputies had the drop on you an' Pete...
He's dead, Bill.
Listen, Bill, I'm gonna see what's takin' The Kid so long. Must be he's gettin' an advance offa them sportin' ladies.
Ned... Is that you, Ned?  Ned, I seen... death.
Two.
We got to kill this other one first.  Shit, Ned, if we're lucky, we could kill him by nightfall... or maybe tomorrow morning. Then we could head back, all three of us, with the money.
Before I met your maw, God rest her soul, it used to be I was kinda... wicked... drinkin' spirits an' gettin' into scrapes an' all. Only she made me see the error of my ways an'... I ain't like I was no more.
I don't like the question.
Shit, Kid, you pulled your pistol... right outta the lady an' out the back window.
I've been looking all over for you. You still after the coke that walked out of that blood bath in the harbor?
We know, but our man says no way on the dope. This Hungarian tells me the whole bunch was pulling stumps for Turkey the next' day. They had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it.
There's more.
He says the hair is longer and lighter.
Edie, please. I don't want to hear this right now. What did Renault and Fortier say?
No. It's never going to stop, period. It won't take more than a week before every investor in this city is walking away from us. It's finished. I'm finished.
A glass of water would be nice.
You are a criminal.
RIGHT THERE. FREEZE.
The word I got is you hung up your spurs, man. What's that all  about?
How do I know that? How about it, pretzel-man? What's your story?
Dig.
I can run. I got no problem with that.
Hurt you, you sonofabitch? I could kill you.
You okay?
McManus wants to go in shooting. I said no way.
Russian, I think. I don't know.
Who's your boss?
A strange threat. I can only assume you're here to kill me anyway. Pity about Mr. Redfoot.
You're lying.
Business or personal?
Who is he?
Tell him we'll meet.
If it was a dope deal, where's the dope, if it was a hit, who called it in?
Keaton was a piece of shit.
I just want to hear your story.
You know a religious guy named John Paul?
I'11 be sure to mention that to him.
Kobayashi.
Can we just get back to Kobayashi?
Kobayashi told us where we could find Fenster.
Why didn't you say anything?
I don't.
Then why didn't you help him?
I never heard of him.
But how - wait. You're saying SOZE sent                  t us to kill someone?
I'11 take my chances, thank you. It's tougher to buy the cheapest bag-man than it is to buy a cop.
Counselor, you're bluffing. Shall I push for misdemeanor two?
Abrams...
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
As far as we know, nothing.
This is a nuisance suit.  He's looking for small change.  He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
All right.  But let's keep the price down.  I've called Ed Concannon.  He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.
No.
Through, through his book.
I am seventy-four years old.
Sir.  Yes.  When a thing is wrong...as in this case, I am available.  I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.  I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
Nothing further, your Honor.
I'll rule on that presently.   Proceed.
Yes.
I...yes.
You've just said you signed it.
I thought I would need it.
After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in.  He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.    And he told me to change the form.  He told me to change the one to a nine.   Or else, or else, he said...  He said he'd fire me.  He said I'd never work again....Who were these men...? Who were these men...?  I wanted to be  a nurse...
Hold on a second.
I understand.    I went to the Bar Association.  They tell me you're going to be disbarred.
It was good of you to meet...
It's my opinion it took him much longer.  Nine...ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.
Yes.
You're going to settle out of court?
What are they going to do?  Not invite me to their Birthday party ...?   Look, I gotta go.  I have to be in Cambridge ...
Okay.  I'll meet you here.  Tuesday night ... I gotta go.  You going my way?
To do right.  Isn't that why you're doing it?
No.
And ask me what?
Why is that?
...things change.
I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
I'm sure you would.
I don't have a week.  This case never should have come to trial. You know better.  You're Mr. Independent.  You want to be independent?  Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
What?
And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.'  'Cause I know who you were.  You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are.  I know who you are.
Damn right I'm done.  I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass.
Noted.  Thank you.   Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness.  Her sole rebuttal was the document,  which has been disallowed...
I have to reach him.  This is an emergency.  Could you give me his home number?
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
Kathy Price.
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
Missus...
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
I've got to work.
I...
And what makes you so tough?
It's over!
No.
... You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them ...
What?
Frank, but not now.  Frank.  You're trying to wipe out some old business.  But not now.  I understand.  But you go call 'em back.  You call the Bishop back.
So what do you want me to do? Concannon's going to try the case his way, I'm going to try it mine. You want me to go wee wee wee all the time because he's got some flack, got stories in the newspaper. I'm going to win this case.
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
Yeah.
Read me what she said.
Hello.  This is Mr. Dorchester in Records.  We're looking for Kathy Costello...
... we, we love her, Dick and me ...
You know how beautiful she was?   Her husband left her, and he took her kids .... They, they, they'd let you die in there.  They don't care.  Nobody cares.  The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care ... in Arlington ...?  They'd take her in.  Perpetual care.  They'd take her.  Fifty thousand dollars they want.  An endowment.
... and I have inquiries out to doctors, experts in the field ... there is, of course, a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor's negligent ...
I'm going to see you get that chance.
She did?
Hi.  How are you doing?
You live in the neighborhood?
How old is he?
Yes.
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
Yes.
...everybody.  Mike says, `Pat, you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer, and then you go in the back and get laid?'  `That's correct.'  Mike says, `Pat.  Have you been in this bar ?'  Pat says, `No, but my sister has ...'   Everyone.  Buy yourself one too.
Yes.
Yes, the roving nurse...
We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.   We were trying to restore her...
San Francisco's changed. The things a that spell San Francisco to me are disappearing fast.
No, I'm all right.
Then?
Well?
Have you talked to the doctors at all?
We're going to an opening at the opera tonight. We'll dine at Ernie's first.  Which is easier?
There are things you didn't tell me.
Well, that explains it. Anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that.
I -- I --
What happened?
Did she hurt herself?
Do you live here in the hotel?
But before! Where did you live before!?!
I want to know who you are.
Why?
I'll get my car and be back in half an hour.
No.
Yes.
But Scottie, you don't have to!
They're none of them right.
No, I don't want any clothes! I don't want anything! I want to get out of here!
Yes.
It should be back from your face -- with a bun at the neck. I told them. I told you.
Too late. I've got my face on.
No, Ernie's is fine.
I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
Madeleine died here.
I need you.
No! Let me go!
You can't. You're afraid!
You...  ...fell into the Bay.
At...
Where had you been before?
You're not. Merely direct. What were you doing there? At Old Fort Point?
You like it, too.
Oh! Yes! Here!
Yes, I knew which one it was. It's out there, now. But I didn't think you'd want to be brought home that way.
Not at all, I enjoyed --
The first time I've been grateful for Coit Tower.
I don't like them.
I don't know. An open grave. I stand by the gravestone looking down into it. And it's my grave.
No. It's new and clean, and waiting.
I'm here, I've got you...
It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village...
Yes?! But --
No, never!
Too late... there's something I must do...
You can't.
Let me go.
Please let me go.
I won't lose you.
Why?
What is her name?
How long has she had the room?
I saw her come in five minutes. ago.
I thought you said no more aches and pains?
No three-way stretch? How very un- chic.
More than you think.
What are you going to do? Now that you've quit the police force?
No, it's your life. But you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day.
Johnny, the doctors explained --
To forget? Don't be so motherly, Midge. I'm not going to crack up.
Uh-huh!
You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
Three whole weeks.
That's Skid Row... isn't it?
Sorry, old man. Work.
What.
How?
Well, who? Come on, you know everybody.
Yeah.
And she died...
For what?
And the idea is that the Beautiful Mad Carlotta has come back from the dead, to take possession of Elster's wife?  Ah, Johnny! Come on!
Think?  Well, what do you think?
Oh?
I just thought if I gave you a drink and fed you some dinner, you'd be so grateful you'd take me to a movie.
If you want to. Naturally, we won't talk about anything you don't want to talk about.
Good. I've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department.
What is it, a still life?
How soon can it be altered?
Don't touch her. Call 911.
What?
Because my opinion threatens yours, it's poorly developed?
Boyd brought up divorce statistics.
Franco mother-fucking Harris!
Why?!
What are you talking about?
I'm calling the ambulance.
We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. What options? Call the police.
There's more.
What were we doing officer? Why didn't we help her? Well...we're all a bit high, you know, bachelor party, that kind of thing. Fisher here is getting married in three days...Beautiful wife ...he didn't have anything at all to do with it...It was all Micheal here... just Micheal...
Nobody knows she's here. I called her personally. Nobody knows.
It's a marble floor, we can clean it up.
According to Jewish law, the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being. They must be buried together or their souls won't rest in peace.
That is absolutely not true.
Open the suitcases, unpack the body parts and reunite the limbs.
Any time fat boy!
At the seven-eleven.
They're on me. They're smoking me out!
What?
I know you'll be.  Three hours.
Right! That's exactly what I'm saying. My father said, first of all, I'm your father not your friend. I'm your father.
No. I think it's fucked.
I know and I'm honored...
I know...
What.
There's more.
Yes money. Adam had a five hundred dollar Term Life Insurance Policy.
Ah, yeah, hi. Is Tina there?
I'm with Tina. Is she there?
Where is she?
She's still working?
Great. Fine. Perfect.
That's the whole point. They rarely work out. But on occasion they do. And when they do, they do big.
Fine. Don't come crying to Boyd. No sir.
He's fine. Okay Mikey, let's go.  You guys stay here.
Well, I didn't mean it.
Who's up for making some real money?
Shut up.
Nobody knows.
However it goes, the point is, nobody says anything to anyone ever. Right? ...Right?
You always were a jealous man.
No, the problem, as I recall, was the lack of blocking...
Shut up Boyd.
Exactly! Exactly my point.
You want to know what you are doing here?! You are love pumping. You are protecting all that is sacred and beautiful and in sync with poetry and sunsets and little newborn babies. You are walking the walk. This is it Fisher, the real stuff. You love this woman. Love is second to nothing. I love you. I love Moore. I love Micheal. This car is full of love, and nothing - absolutely nothing - supersedes love, man. Nothing. We will do what it takes. Whatever it takes.
Does she sound pissed, scared, hostile? Did she mention the police?
Hear what?
Fine? Fine what?
You're sick.
Not a prayer.
What? What's your point?
What?
You will not screw this up.
Micheal get a grip.  What did you tell her?
Goosed!
Goosed!
All right then. It's refreshing to see two young people not afraid of real commitment. Will you have friends or family saying words - singing or anything?
I do.
Government cutbacks.
I think so.
I sent a lot of checks, I'm not sure what all of them are.
Yup.
Yes.
I think so.
How could I know what else I forgot?
You know how important this is to my mother. You know that.
I'm just saying I bet those checks all found the mailboxes.
David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas.
Who else?
It's vile!
I've seen it on television.
With all my heart.
Okay.
We're leaving in three hours.
More than I ever imagined being able to love anyone ever.
We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off.
Nesting?
I'm mad at you.
Hey. It's me.
We're on our way home. I just...we're running a little late.
No. Just like an hour or so.
What!
No. No. I'll see you in about four hours.
Now?
Are they fighting?
Nobody's saying cancel. I'm talking about modifying.
We're not canceling.
I won't even discuss it.
Yeah. You.
Liz we've got to cancel, we have to put it off.
What money?
The only proof is those bodies.
Do you love me? DO YOU LOVE ME?!
You never walked away dad. You could have walked away.
I love you dad.
I don't know. She's really been stressing out.
About what?
I just want her to be happy.
You're not breathing right?
He's your brother.
The wahoo moment?
Did he try to kiss you?
I'm saying it's luck. All luck. You work your entire life, all the training, focus, all the dedication, all irrelevant. Where does the ball bounce? My father spent his whole life trying to start a company, practiced every day, worked like a dog, finally got enough money. He's paid the dues, he's ready, does all the market research, picks his shot - "Pup Corn."
That's our plan.
I don't think that's a good idea.
No, I don't want to because they yell. And I've got news for you too.
That one.
I'm well ... The bus was late, wasn't it? ... What was the journey like?
No. Mother Superior told me to come.
Who is she?
Thank you, Uncle.
Today I can refuse you nothing.
I don't like masquerading, but as you see I decided to give in to your whim.
No, Uncle, and now I'm pleased to have been able to do this favor, because, although I didn't think so at first, you are really a good man.
Go away! Leave me alone.
It's only that ... It's all very odd, sir.
Come on, miss. Just so the Virgin can be really pretty.
He was asking for it.
Quiet, my dove. Quiet, or I'll ...
It's Viridiana. She's getting on my nerves.
No, not mad at all: she's rotten with religion.
If you free me, you'll be a rich man ...
Where's the dough?
Why?
If I wait until tomorrow, it'll be the same as yesterday and the day before and all the other days. When you're not with your poor people, you're praying or you disappear, I never see you.
But you have a right to let us know what you think.
Do they worry you that much, then?
You can come and live again in the big house if you want. Now that I'm alone, I can settle down anywhere.
Things seem to be getting better.
Why not?
I'm afraid.
Very, very?
Don Jaime loved to watch me skip.
The retreat will start soon. You can leave tomorrow morning.
I had so many things to think about!
You are forgiven. Goodbye.
I have a headache.
Oh, you slept well; don't worry.
Yes, yes, I saw you!
If you try to run, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself.
He would slaughter eight people sitting in a room, but not two prison guards?
I'm getting by.
If you can catch him.
Their weapons missing?
Where's my gun?
Any sign of Lindenmeyer?
We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary re—assignment.
You're the highest law enforcement official in the country. Use the fucking army if you need to.
Barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field, remember?
Lindenmeyer developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system. If the simulator isn't calibrated properly, experiencing death in this level of VR is like experiencing death within a dream. The experience becomes real.
I'M WHAT?!
This is supposed to be years away.
How do you kill it?
I think I understand what you have in mind...
Of course you are.
No, I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you.  How you feeling today?
What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?
I don't have to do anything except survive. And it's taking everything I've got just to do that.
Manson didn't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene.
I know who would know.
Do me one favor —— if you shoot at anything, make sure I'm nowhere near it.
Dahmer carried the head of one of his victims in a bowling bag for over a week. Kept it in his locker while he was at work in a candy factory.  We need to get a look at Sid 6.7's final profile.
I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.
Dammit, I hate sounding so clinical all the time. All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well, but then I...
Stop me.
I'm doing the best I can!
Both.
They're going to fry me for it, anyway.
I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious.
Part of him is.
Thanks.
A bomb's going off tomorrow night, but I have no idea where.
I've got some final preparations to take care of—— Checking his watch, he stops suddenly.
As long as you keep overpaying me, I'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well.
Mr. Wallace, I could have 10 of them ready by tomorrow.
When you...  What?  I'm busy.
You wouldn't be here if it wasn't true.  It's true, right?
I could tell you stories:  Cecil B. Demille:  Alright? The Greatest Show on Earth:  He needs an elephant,

All right, I owe you one Marv.
Get the hell out!
I want to make it up to you. Bluestar, put all your clients in it.
Start unloading.
It's called pasta now Dad, spaghetti's out of date.
D.K. -- didn't know -- who I was when the options he bought took a bath. He reneged on me.
Coulda been a contender.
Look Dad, I'm not a salesman. How many times I gotta tell you I'm an account executive, and pretty soon I'm going to the investment banking side of the firm.
It's Queens, Dad and a 5% mortgage and you rent the top room--I gotta live in Manhattan to be a player, Dad. There's no nobility in poverty anymore, y'know. One day you're going to be proud of me, you'll see... 
How's Mom?
...Work okay?
Client. Got a private jet over at Butler Aviation... Dad, you always gotta light up when you see me, it's the...
You speak for me, son.
Yeah, don't want to be late for my own funeral.
We are?
Yeah, check out Teldar Paper, it's still not over.
He never told me...
I just want to let you know Mr. Gekko I read all about you at NYU Business, and I think you're an incredible genius and I've always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you...
Jackson, Steinem...
A comer. 80 medium-body jets. 300 pilots, flies northeast, Canada, some Florida and Caribbean routes... great slots in major cities...
Nice to see you again Mr. Gekko.
...I can't even see it...
Mr. Gekko, I don't think I can...go on.
Yes...
...we have 37.2 million invested. At this point, we're up 3.1 million and some change. If it goes to 75 bucks we can clean close to 12 mill.
My firm needs your signature on these option agreements tonight, sir, otherwise we could take a real bath tomorrow.
"All warfare is based on deception..." Sun Tzu says, If your enemy is superior, evade him, if angry, irritate him, if equally matched, fight... if not, split and reevaluate.
...Gordon.
I think I got some friends that won't mind making some easy money...
What makes you think you can?
I'm sorry, this can't wait.
Maybe you ought to read him Pinocchio. You told me you were going to turn Bluestar around. Not upside down. You used me.
Tell me, Gordon--when does it all end? How many yachts can you waterski behind? How much is enough?
Obviously...
Gordon.
I gather you're a decorator.
Break it.
You may call me a yuppie... It's Mister Yuppie to you.
And what do you want?
I'm kidding, I'm kidding, we're still young, Darien. So what's money anyway when everybody's making it, it's all relative. After all, this is not the house in Connecticut, this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years...before we slip our two lovely kids, Yuppie and Fruppie into the Lycee Francaise.
Talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped. I handed it to him on a silver platter. I told my father and those people...
I'm not gonna let it happen Darien.
At least I wouldn't be pulling the trigger.
What the hell's that supposed to mean?
You're not exactly pure Bud, you went after Gekko with the same vengeance you went after me. Look in the mirror before...
Jesus, can't make a buck in this market, country's going to hell faster than when that sonofabitch Roosevelt was around... too much cheap money sloshing around the world. The biggest mistake we ever made was letting Nixon get off the gold standard. Putney Drug--you boys might want to have a look at it.
Can't get a little bit pregnant, Bud.
No, are you crazy? And I don't want him ever to know. Do you understand?...
Now tell me, why would I want to do that?
He's flowing, Gordo. Piece of cake.
Congratulations but rarer still is your interest in Anacott Steel.
You guys must know something nobody else knows. If those are my plans, it's the first I've heard of it.
With Mark?
Yeah, yeah, OK
But he still has something Mark hasn't.
About what?  About us.
I'm sorry I'm not that good at languages ok?
Hi
Thank you
Thank you
You don't happen to have the address do ya?
Vell.  Goodnight.
Safety in numbers man.
Must be what we came for. The four stand slowly and enter through the doors, which close behind them.  They begin walking around  the WAXWORKS, which appear gruesome. The first they spy is of a high school student with a letter  jacket on the verge of being hacked with an axe by and angry woodsman.  They give each other looks of  disgust and continue on.  The next is of a Frankenstein-esque creature carrying a woman in its arms.  The  four are now roaming around the WAXWORKS individually, with TONY encountering what appears to be  a tribal INDIAN pointing a knife towards a victim.  MARK walks past a circus cart with some sort of werebeast inside, and then continues on to a staircase exhibit with a dead woman at the base of it.  On the  staircase is a zombie-fied creature.  We see CHINA walking on the other side of a bandage wrapped man  pumping gasoline into a woman's mouth.  Finally, we see TONY walking up to a cottage room display.
So Mark, what's so urgent?
Sell my soul?
You get yourself a regular job, as Satan's disciple.
Maybe before the event, never after.
Mom.
They're all human beings
But mom, I NEED THE CAFFINE - BADLY
Come on Mark MARK Ah hell, why not.  I'll get the maid to write the essays
It's only two hours away.
No, he wouldn't.
That's not true.
Mine.  His.  We both...thought...
Your husband?
Because, I don't know, because sometimes...sometimes I forget things...and ever since Caitlin left, ever since my daughter left for school, there've been...I fainted and...  Why is this so hard?
Mm-hmm.
What does she look like?
Do you have any idea who she is?
Well, that's what we're here for.
Maybe.  I don't know.  I just know that when all this was happening, I felt, some part of me felt...alive.  Like somebody needed me.  And the more I reached out to, it, the fuller it became.
You were in an accident?
Who's that?
She isn't here.
It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer.  From next door.  Is everything--
I've never even met you.
You do?
Thank you.
Claire.
I don't know.
Of course.
I came in from my room...
And so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club.
She's not a psychic.  Just a very enlightened spirit.
Listen, I've gotta run.  I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning?
I don't...
It's initials.  F is Feur.  It's her.
Jody, wait.
Did I?
Hartford?
Artsy little village down seven.  There's a guy there who sells my work.  I had just dropped off some paintings and as I got in my car...I saw Norman sitting at this little cafe.
Feur, I think.  Psych department.  Figures. They're all psychotic.
No, no.  I'm just about...  There.
I am, really.
We did.
Yup.
After that.
More or less.
That's not what I'm sug--
I know.
In the house.  I was scared.
Really?
That's...
I'm so sorry.
That's just mean.  Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get her some.
What do you mean?  Claire, we talked about it.  You didn't want Japanese, I said, Our first date since...
...since Caitlin.  You don't remember this?
Okay, okay, I'm sure that I just...
I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.
Harvey says he's amazing.
No!  And I don't need a psychiatrist!
I will NOT.
Then where is she?
Good.  You sat in front...I saw you there...
In the living room...
Yes.  The ghost.
Stop...
Wouldn't go that far.
What's the matter?
What?
Who?
It's alright.
Huh.
Fine.  I'll do the shopping.
Okay.  Don't...you don't understand what this is.
IT'S TRUE.  That's...you have to believe me!  Oh God, I'm telling you the truth!  I did what I had to, Claire.  She was gone.  There was nothing I could do for her.  I did...I put her in the lake.  I rolled the car in...and I watched it sink.  And I've lived with that image ever since.  I couldn't just stand there while everything-- my career, us, everything, just washed away.  Don't you see, Claire?  She's doing this!  This is exactly what she wants you to think!
But you've not told Michael.
I wish everyone would stop commenting on my health.  I'm the doctor.
But why would they do that...?
Come.  There is a lot to read
A spirit.  Perhaps evil...   ...and he has come to you- with Diedre gone - you've... inherited him.
Mm-hmm.    Seems & lot longer.
Out of the question      Rowan, coming here will not change the -
A Mayfair it ever I saw one.
Other properties as well - here and in Europe.  And vest holdings - in sugar, oil, gold, electronics.  Liquid funds over eighty million.  tmpcssible to put a figure on it all. All yours now.
'He'...?
I'll tell OR we're bringing -
Nooo...  NO!  Stop!
I LOVE him!
I only wanted to see as others do... feel as others do...  ...but Marguerite could not help me.  Nor Julien...
But have I...?  Ever...?!
I love Michael...
Change me, Rowan, and we can change everything...
Tell me what I am, Rowan.
No!   Don't!  Lasher!!!
I know.    you are my son -
I'm glad you're around to say it.
Then call it in. Mr. Curry. Whatever's happeninq to you - death is not the preferable alternative.  I'm in the life business - remember..?
Nothing.  Absolutely nothing-
The one time I want it to work...
Mm-hmm.     Scared-  I feel a little like the moth and the flame.
He fools around with his patients too.
Captain's orders.
Let's see...  Next you tell me all the terrible things about you - and prove that we're doomed to fail - right...?   you hate kittens and puppies, you've drivin all your lovers to suicide --and those mysterious deaths at the hospital were really -
Michael - this place is increadible.  You - you're brilliant...  The things you created...

Mad. for each other.
Listen.  Last night - oh Christ, this'1l take forever to explain. God, Michael...
Is it more or less crazy than dying and coming back to life with hands that can see...?  God, Michael --- what am I...?
But it scares the hell out of you, doesn't it. Michael...?
Rowan...   Think of what's in that book.  Think of last night!
Hello..
Hey - I'm getting married in the morning - I already gave up drinking. one crutch at a time, Doctor.
That's GREAT!
A little wine...?
Where are you gitting these...?  Aaron --- if it's a boy.
What were you talking about...?
Nothing is wrong with me.  I know something's in there - and so do you.
Hi.    You - you wanna get some breakfast...?  Maybe see a movie...?
It's not true.  You have to believe me.
Michael - please -  just. a little longer.  Don't leave.
Michael - I'm sorry...  Just give me -
It's alright...it's airight.  He's gone, Michael...  Gone.
Bullshit!  Let me in!   Mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont.
That's a wasp.  Fuckers'll sting a tree if they're bored-  so - where is she...?
If you like that type.
Just nervous.  Getting married, you know.     Got the rings...?
Hey - I love gloves-  I look really great in gloves.
Well I'm glad I'm not them - what are you doing here so late? Come to that, what the hell have you got that for?
Yes it is...
Then we would have to call in our locksmith to break the lock
That's right...
I didn't say that - I'm sure it could be, but our clients must sign in first, checking signatures, and a photo ident - we had a nasty theft two years ago and we've been very strict since then.
I'm sorry?
And how many people have you killed?
my car  I stopped working from my car.  She could have stopped me you know - If she really wanted too. That is the difference between the confusion of humanity and the purity of the beast - If a dog attacked you - you could easily kill it without any damage to yourself - Why then do people get bitten by dogs - savaged? Why?
I don't know...
I have something I have to show you...
STEPHANIE?
I know this sounds insane ELLEN, but... Telling you all of this, writing the book... It feels good. Don't get me wrong - I feel like a weight is being lifted from my shoulders... When I tell you what I have done - I can't believe it is me...Yet I know it was. This is like a purging for me...
I am ashamed of what I have done ELLEN. When I read what you had written it made me think - look into myself - I haven't dared look into myself for a long time - I have stopped ELLEN, I can't carry on - I won't carry on. All I want is to start a new life - I want a second chance...You are good to me - you don't condescend, you're intelligent, and very beautiful...
Open it...
What was I supposed to do?
There isn't that much - you didn't even taste it - What's wrong - don't you like my tea?
Why whats wrong with the sugar -
CRAP! - I wish I had taken a photo of your face when I gave some to that DETECTIVE - What's wrong ELLEN - you look pale - maybe you have been eating the wrong kind of foods lately - it could be food poisoning?
At 2.00...
I don't know - it's your house ELLEN
What's this all about?
I'm here about the so called disappearance of your husband - It's best if we let old bones lie. Know what I mean?  I'm working on the WHITE ANGEL case now - and I've got to check all known murderers or suspected murderers for the last five years... And that means you...So where were you last THURSDAY afternoon around five...
Oh...
I'll be sure to...
That's crazy talk.
Poor Freud, turning in his grave.
Dead?
Chicks are like buses. If you miss one, don't sweat it. There's another coming 'round the corner.
Except the girl. The only one that really mattered.
Yeah?
SHUT UP!  Are you serious? Of course I will...of course.
You like me. I like you. I guess it's pretty obvious to everyone.
So that's a maybe?
You have changed since second grade.
Of course, dumpling. Its very nice of Ted but...
But that doesn't make you the boss of everything, son.
It's my private business! Mine!
Dad, please.
Of course we are.
I guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face.
...not the pit.
You ordered a Winnebago?
I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick.
Shopping, really? I should tell my friend.
Whatever you want.
Of course we were.
Everything.
We'll send you the release forms, Ted. Our staffers will help in any way they can.
Well, Jay. They've been exceptionally supportive.
I see, so you'd be open to little ladies from Pasadena, who want to show you their knickers?
She knew exactly where you were staying, which you neglected to tell me, your own brother.
Most places are, Jimmy.
So, what brings you here at his hour?
You can have it, then. I'm not going back there.
You can't come back. That is, you can, but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine.
Funny you should say that. My Grandfather was a peach farmer.
That's just one example. My reporting has made a difference.
Me-ow.
I'm trying to help.
Interesting.
You never know around here.
I did my homework. Your grandfather was a peach farmer.
Put your eyeballs back in your head, William Randolph. I'm on assignment. A girl has to fit in.
I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati.
You expected whips, chains, Merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood?
Maybe someday.
You're quick. I like that.
No cursing in this house, young man. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
Oh, Teddy. We missed you so much.
Yes, sir. I'll brace myself.
A new pediatric wing at the hospital? A presidential campaign? Name it. Anything.
Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.
Of course I like girls.
Indeed it is. During the day, visitors prefer to be outside, au naturel. As it were.
I...uh...I think she's doing fine on her own.
Tipping?
You are a multi-media magnate. The Tycoon of Tits. The Baron of Bottoms.
I was like a different person tonight.
In other words, our scope is too narrow.
I'm Ted Nelson. I guess you already know that part.  For two years I've been the editor of the high school paper in Xenia, Ohio. I've won some awards, made a difference. I've always had journalism in my soul. Now I know why.
Really? So I'm doing OK?
I wish I knew you years ago, when my brother was alive. I wish he never gave you up.
You're right. I should work, too. Our first issue together is almost ready to print.
You're a great kid. Don't you forget it.
I was in the middle of a melodramatic exit. It wouldn't really make a statement if I tiptoed out the door...What are you selling?
People pay good money for that?
Well kid, I'm speaking of...your biological parents.
Kelly Van Ryan...
Sam... I...  Sandra Van Ryan's been on the horn with every member of the school board all day long.  She's pushing for suspension...
That's great.  I'll just tell my creditors I'm not a rapist.  No problem... Shit.  I can't believe the board's going to act without even hearing my side of it.
I... You know... I...
What about the blood?
What if something distracts it and it snaps anyway?
And the child...
And the other girl, Kelly.  Suzie's niece.
I know one thing he said.  It was when... when he took himself out and was standing up.  He said, "Don't worry, I didn't come." I can't forget that.  He said, "No little girl can ever make me come."
Ray thinks she was murdered.
Yeah, well, Van Ryan got his.  I don't imagine he gives a shit now.
The skinny brunette.
You mean Camp Sixty-Nine.
Unless what?
Her father didn't leave her squat.  The kid's got money in trust from her grandfather, but she can't touch that till her mother dies and Sandra seems to have the idea that Kelly ought to learn the value of a buck.
I flat don't like the guy, Glory.  He's dirty.  And I'll tell you something else.  You want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money?  He was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land Deal.  It was after the war.  Van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land, got investors like Lombardo to put up money, then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve, on the sly, of course, but everyone knew it was him.  The freeway went to the coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it.
What?  You wouldn't go after some guy you thought raped your daughter?  Cone on.  She bought the same story we did...
Just check out the car.
You don't think Sam could've put it there?
Ray, you heard him...
The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's.
You think this is just about money, about us looking foolish?  Question him. You're gonna find a stone cold manipulative psychopath.  And those girls are going to wind up dead...
Get off this Ray, now.  If there is any evidence here, it's for Homicide.  You get an ID, you call me.
Just tell us what happened.
I wanna go home now.
Okay!  He did.  He pushed me to the floor and he did it to me.  Now, can I go home?
I said he did.
No.  But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would...
Man, I wanna smoke a joint.
I was raped.  By Sam Lombardo.
I won't.
Drop dead... You know where my mom is trying to get the money to pay you off? She's trying to break my trust.  How do you like that?  I can't touch it until she's dead and she won't give me a dime and now she's trying to break it to pay you...
Stick?
Why can't you come...
That's not your line.
Lady has some deep pockets.  That's all I'm saying.
What's that supposed to mean?
Good.  So what we're going to do is march right to Hunter's doorstep.  We're going to insist they take a statement. We're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back.  They're walking a fine line here. Defamation of character, malicious prosecution...
Fair enough.  Let's go make a statement.
That's right.
I don't mean who you're thinking.  I have other friends...
Kelly was supposed to be framed, not killed.  What I'm telling you is, I don't like surprises.
Good.  Just keep telling yourselves that, the only people who can fuck this up is us.
The guy was history when he killed Kelly.  You knew that.
But then it is better this way, don't you think?  No loose ends.
Yeah, real funny.  You're wrong about this, I could get busted on the spot.
I'll bet.  Look, Sam.  Why don't you come by this weekend.  We'll take the boat out...
Listen, Kelly skipped school.  Have you talked to her?
Shit. Here we go again.
Funny, I was just thinking you should do the same.  Since I am already in residence, and am obviously the man for the job, it's been grand making your acquaintance, sir.  And best of luck in all your future endeavors.
Wouldn't dream of it.
Put them all together and what do we have?
Then why kidnap them?  Why not just kill them?
Well... it's the only one I have. It's gotten me out of quite a few tight spots...
Sure.  We have no idea what's going on.
Come on, let's at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton.
You'd think if Loveless is going to kill him he could at least be a prominent citizen.
It's not a guy...
That rules out Willard, Vermont; Willard, Minnesota...  Willard, New Mexico?
Not likely.  There must be tracks of twenty different wagons.  Freight wagons, carriages, buckboards...
I don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers!
Oh, I see, an easy plan!
In the next two minutes?
I'm sure we will.
My Lord, he was telling the truth!
Well, see, he had this little wagon when he was a kid...
Here.  Mr. Tyler.  He claims a certain skill at handling firearms.
Really?
My... the wild west.
Would that include me?
That'll be all, boys.
And?
He had a pressing engagement.
Has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers?  You are in my domain!
It is?
Just get me some horses.
Thought you might get lonely, Mad- martigan!
What is Tir Asleen?
You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody.
No I'm not.  Have you really looked at me?  I'm short!  Even for a Nelwyn!
No.  I mean yes.
You're not a woman.
Say what?
As above, so below.
You be careful.  I'm a powerful sorcerer.  I could turn you into a toad just like that.
You don't know anything about ba- bies.
Absolutely!
Where the hell did you come from?
Time to leave.
You?
Willow!
That's my fault, not hers.  I've got to keep practicing.  I'm still in the learning stage but magic, Madmartigan, requires concentration and--
Ahhh!
No, it's too big to be a Nelwyn baby.  It looks like a daikini...
No!
Burn it to a fine ash.
I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!
Shhhhh!
His will.
Surrender!!
Somebody has to do it.
He never misses.
Yes!  Raziel!  She lives out on that island!
Who is that horrible friend of yours?
No!  You let us handle this.  Come along, Rool!
Guess I'm not used to so much.
Okay, Mr. Book.
Zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight – street chemists... the guys processing this P2P into speed.
Maybe.
I hope you don't have any doubts about that.
Who else knows?
A hot shower... I haven't changed clothes in two days.
We're looking for a suspect. We've reason to believe he's still in the area.
He wants to know who you are. Your name. I told him we don't need to know anything about you.
Yes. And I also want to leave this city.
No you're not –  You're glad, because now you've got a witness.  I heard the other police talking last night.  They don't seem to like you very much.
Because – somehow – they knew I was getting close.  Look, it's narcotics... They make dope out of chemicals... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars. They'll do anything.  And they can get away with it because they're cops.
The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life.
Something wrong with buttons?
Anything against zippers?
Quaint? Can't imagine why.
Telephone? The Gunthers across the valley. They're Mennonite. They have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even.
I'm going this morning.
I know what he said.
I'm leaving tonight.  I'm going to need my clothes. And my gun.
Well in the City of Philadelphia, God needs a little help!
I hear you.
What I know, Paul, is...  He's going to take you out...
You didn't have to...
Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him.
At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way.
I know God help me, I know that, Eli.  But I tell you that if he's found here, the people who did this to him will come for Samuel.
I have done nothing against the ordnung.
I have committed no sin.
You are acting like one!
Tight. But I'm working on him.
All right, where is he?
No... No. It is just the English way.
Fifty-seven, fifty-eight --
Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing.
Dorothy.  Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.
There, there, lie quiet now.  You just had a bad dream.
Here, here, what's all this jabber-wapping when there's work to be done?  I know three shiftless farm hands that'll be out of a job before they know it!
I saw you tinkering with that contraption, Hickory. Now, you and Hunk get back to that wagon!
If she...
Ohhh!
No -- No!  It was an accident! I didn't mean to kill anybody!....
I'm sorry.  I didn't do it!  Can I still have my dog?
Oh.  But, if you please -- what are Munchkins?
Then close your eyes, and tap your heels together three times.
There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.
Why --
Please, Professor, why can't we go along with you?
Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.
Has it poppies on the wall....
I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.
Oh, but he will!  He must!  We've come such a long way already. 
Oh --
I knew you would!
Lions and tigers and bears!
The nerve.
Yes.
Oh, come on.
Huh?  What'd he say?
Are you gonna stand around And let 'em fill us full of horror?
Ohhh!
Ohhh --
But I'd face a whole box full of them for the chance of getting some brains.  Look -- I won't be any trouble, because I don't eat a thing -- and I won't try to manage things, because I can't think.  Won't you take me with you?
Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
To Oz?
Oh --
And I'll keep the oil-can handy.
Oh, no -- please.  I have to rest for just a minute.  Toto!
Oh, he's been crying! Why have you been --
Well, we'd better hurry if we're going to see the Wizard!
Ah --
It did?
Who at?
Somebody pulled my tail.
Fine.  He's got a plan
All right, I'll go in there for Dorothy -- Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch -- guards or no guards -- I'll tear 'em apart.  I may not come out alive, but I'm going in there.  There's only one thing I want you fellows to do.
Yeah!
Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.
Don't push!
Ohhhhhh!
B-B-B-B-B-But if we do that, we'll have to kill her to get it!
I'll see you reach the Wizard, whether I get a heart of not.  Bee-hive -- bah!  Let her try and make a bee-hive out of me! You know -- Hmm? What's that?
We do.
I'd be clever as a gizzard --
A heart --
Don't cry -- you'll rust yourself again!
Ho -- ho --ho
Oh, no!
Well, you can't.  As for you, my fine friend -- you're a victim of disorganized thinking.  You are under the unfortunate delusion that simply because you run away from danger, you have no courage.  You're confusing courage with wisdom.  Back where I come from, we have men who are called heroes.  Once a year, they take their fortitude out of mothballs and parade it down the main street of the city.  And they have no more courage than you have.  But! They have one thing that you haven't got! A medal!  Therefore -- for meritorious....
Don’t know any doctor jokes.
When this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens.
Then it’s no longer a bomb?
Makes her look even more innocent.
Because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines. There would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world...
Elektra would control it all.
We go down to the torpedo bay.
Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. He’s a man of great integrity.
It’s barely a scratch. The Dome broke my fall.
I was the one who brought that money in...
Who?
Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist?
The inside man?
Indeed.
Is that why you want to finish the pipeline?
It’s my father’s pin. He wore it everyday of his life.
That’s every man within a five mile radius.  Including you.  That’s why you’re here, isn’t it? You think I can’t do it. You think I’m going to screw up. Or get myself killed.
No.
I know.
I think you’re one of the bravest people I’ve ever met.
Someone wants to kill me, I’d rather die looking him straight in the eye.  What are you doing here?  Looking for a woman a little more your type? How about that one?
You had your chance, James. Now I’m looking for a bigger thrill.
A little. Does it matter? After all, what’s the point of living if you can’t feel alive?  Isn’t that right, Elektra? Isn’t that your motto?
You can drop the act, it’s over.
I think you do.
Bond, I’m a civilian. This is my place. Used to be the royal family’s, now it’s mine. I run my little business, I stay out of trouble...
Have some of the rat’s nest caviar.  From my own fishery.  They buy my caviar, drink my champagne, lose to my House.
How high up does this...arms dealing go?
No!  Get me out!
The right kind of explosion in the right spot -- it would block the Bosphorus, cut off the Black Sea.
How appropriate.
What class sub does your nephew run?
Could...could you come?
Please.
Is it?
Of course...
The weather.  I see.  Keep me posted.  I want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum strike conditions.
Washington?
Wrong answers?
Hnnrr.  -- Like to masturbate.  Shit once a day.
Who is she?  Do you know her?
Saw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  God didn't make it that way.  We did.  We make the world -- in our own image.  What else can I illuminate?
Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.
Jon, no -- I can't --
Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg.
Then you're sleeping with Dreiberg?
Always.  Ever since the day I died.
I don't know yet.  I should be able to tell you in -- roughly six hundred years.
I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.
I see what the watchmaker made.  I see the universe!
Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.  Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.
What is it?  How does it work?
What if you¹re wrong??
He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.
Maybe not, but why take chances?
Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old!
Not at all.  You look very -- dashing.  Here, you pick one.
Are you kidding?  If they put him in jail he's dead.  He'll never get to trial.
What are you up to?
I think he's going to the john.
Rorschach, that was a long time ago.  I mean, that -- that's just paranoia.
Toilet clogged.  Short fat turd.  Let's get out of here.
-- What?
Isn't it true that you --
I don't know their real names.
I don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit --
Jon??  You mean he's --
No, no.  You got it all wrong.  I been on the case, Rorschach, I got something for you.
Dr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save the world.
Before you do that, you might want to look at what I've been looking at.
..If you're trolling around for narcs, man, have you got the wrong guy.
Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble.
Are we done now? You've got nothing on me. So if you ain't booking me, I'm walking.
You know what I hate? Any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they're God.
You want the cheap backstory? The runaway mom, the suicide dad and the foster homes? Gimme a break. You're not interested in my past, you're interested in my future as some kind of spy.
Just remember, I'll be watching.
I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?
Oh yeah? Why don't we start by taking this thing off my ankle? The poison needles?
I've seen enough. Turn it off.
You saving me? You talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling.
Naturally.
Kirill, the sniper. Looks like a bookworm, but he had 72 confirmed kills in Chechnya, they called him the "Finger of God". Assassination and weapons.
We hung out last night, remember?
Hey, take it easy. I'm just a dude trying to make a buck.
The eyes don't lie. All this has gotten to you, hasn't it, Petra? You came in as Yorgi's girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun. Now you don't like it so much, but you're in so deep you can't get out anymore. Tell me if I'm wrong, Petra.
Don't judge a comic book by it's cover.
I know where he's coming from. The only thing I really don't get is why he dumped you. Up until I found that out, I thought his judgment was pretty sound.
We could work together. Then maybe we could both get the hell out of here. There's a beach in Bora Bora with my name on it.
There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.
What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.
You don't have to do that.
Aren't they gonna wonder were you've been?
He owns a big industrial complex on the river. He'll launch it from there.
Go to the water, it's that way!
Let me.
I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.
That's would be me.
You have all this talent, and you waste it. You won't take a single endorsement deal. Meanwhile those other guys have their own video games! But no, you've got too much "integrity" for that.
Alright, so I'll get more.
I don't know. I thought this is what you wanted. You want stability, here it is.
You killed me, remember? Now I have to hide out here with you. Where have you been?
What's the deal?
He's a pretty good actor, though.
He flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink.
You tell me! You got a sniper up there or what?
What's "Anarchy 99"?
I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.
Sure, if that's what you want. Why not? It's all human nature. So we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it.
The neuro-filter acts like a surge protector, regulating the infinite flow of information from Cerebro to the Professor's mind.  It's what keeps him from being crushed by the consciousness of millions.
... until he found tungsten.
I'm afraid without Cerebro's help, he won't have the strength to heal himself -- And without the neuro- filter... there's no Cerebro.
His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.
What's that?
Yeah?  Well I don't like to talk about my past.
He's busy right now.
Were you now?
I've seen a lot of rings.
Math.  History.  Science.  English. Athletics --
Treat you like a mutant?  We are not what you think.  Not all of us.
Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.
You're backstage at the encore of creation.
I brought you here so that you would be safe from Magneto.
A very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you. I'm not sure why, but until we find out, I must ask you to stay.
Not at the cost of lives, Max.
What do you want with him?
Let's just say that I am out to make some radical changes.  Now come on Charles.  For old times sake, for your sake...  Leave him to me.
No!
Victor Frankenstein.
Yes, sir.
He has a big mouth.  Yes!  It seems to me I did read something about that incident as a student.  But you have to remember that a worm -- with very few exceptions -- is not a human being.
What lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?
Yes, sir.
MMMmmmm.
MMmmm.
MMmmm.
MMmmm.
Hello...?
Well... yes.
Very....very!
Oh, nice.
You're incorrigible!
Love you! ...Well, why don't we turn in?
No, of course not.  I just meant...
Of course I am.  Now come along like a good boy.
Of course I am.  Now give me a kiss and say good night like my good boy.
It seems fine.
Does that include the key to the laboratory?
I think you must be mistaken, sir.
I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.
Break that old man's violin.
Yes, sir.
One week -- I'll see to it, sir.
I beg your pardon?
Hearts and kidneys are Tinker Toys! I'm talking about the Central Nervous System.
But your grandfather's work, sir...
Fron kon steen!
No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.
Yes, just the two.
I beg your pardon?
What wockers?
What?
Two switches over there, but I wasn't going to be the first.
Yes, I think we could all use a good laugh.
Was he any good?
This guy means business.
What?
Well, I don't like to see you mope.
I'm sorry.  I don't mean to take out my frustration on you.  You've been a great help to me, and I've let you down.
Who are you talking to?
I didn't make a 'yummy' sound -- I just asked what it was.
careful, master -- you never can tell with these chaps.
You can say that again.
Act casual!
I like your style, master.  How do we get him here?
MMMmmmm!  MMMmmmm!
MMmmm!  MMmmm!
Ja, ja.
No, thanks!  I want to get right to sleep.
What is it?  Is something wrong, Doctor?
All right then, quietly!  Close your robe and stay right behind me. Don't make a sound!
What a filthy mess.
I think so.
Good night!
Wonderful?  It's terrible! Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible!
I see what you mean.
Of course not.
His schwanzstucker.
Why certainly.  Don't you, Frau Blucher?
The doctor said to allow seven minutes:  no more and no less -- or else they could both become hopelessly paralyzed.
Yes.
Oh, no sir-ee.  If yo don't have a reservation you can skip to ma-loo.
Now just one moment.  There's no need for roughhousing.  Have you ever tried a tip?
So, you got it in the line of dooty.. ... point taken.
Zulu may not wear shoes or trousers and the like but it don 't mean to say they got no brains. They'll watch us  and wait  and find our weaknesses.
Excuse me, My Lord.  Norris-Newman, of "The Standard", My Lord.
If I've got it right, My Lord, you lead an invasion into Zululand, for I see it all around me, but "why?" is the question my readers will ask. "why?"
Eleven o'clock, My LorJ 42
Thank you.
Certainly, Sin
Yes.
Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while.
I'm to take the Sikali with the main column to the river
