Why?
C'esc ma tete. This is my head
I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
Sure have.
Hi.
I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be "occupied".
But
They do to!
It's more
Hey, sweet cheeks.
Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?
Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --
I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.
Joey never told you we went out, did he?
You looked beautiful last night, you know.
Let go!
I just wanted --
Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...
I was kidding. People actually live there?
That I'm used to.
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list.  With me by your side.
Number one.  She hates smokers
What've you got for me?
Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion".
Cameron, I'm a little busy
What 're you talking about?
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  That's a direct quote
The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?
Take it or leave it.  This isn't a negotiation.
When I shell out fifty, I expect results.
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --
But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?
The people at this school are so incredibly foul.
So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all.
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
William - he asked me to meet him here.
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
Pick you up Friday, then
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
Excuse me?
I say, do what you wanna do.
Okay?
When you were gone last year -- where were you?
No, you weren't
Start a band?
Oh, so now you think you know me?
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
Good call.
So what's your excuse?
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
Create a little drama?  Start a new rumor?  What?
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?
I know.
Why can't we agree on this?
Was that your sister?
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
Which parts?
Tempestuous?
Hey there.  Tired of breathing?
Cool pictures.  You a fan?
You think?
Kat a fan, too?
Ever been to Club Skunk?
I missed you.
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
In the microwave.
Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home.  Let her go.
What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap, crap, crap or crap
What are you listening to, chicken ass?
He's the devil's child...
Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew.  I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.
He is a mercenary!  Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?
It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.
I could be gone for years.
She said yes.
What is it, now?  Tell me...
What does he say?
You defend yourself admirably...
You seem to have a special talent for making friends.
You come!  You speak first!
Chief knows.
Chief says -- how many?
... and also to bring medicine.
You have to find them, Utapan.  Look what they did!
How did you manage it?
Why do you wish to sail west?
Two minutes... and already you're a dead man.  Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon.
I am listening, my son.
New worlds create new people.
How old are you, Senor Colon?
You don't know anything!  Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!
Are you my attorney?  I'm Emil.  I'm insane.
I brought you some letters.  It's really fan mail.  Women mostly.  One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check. Another wants a check.
Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
I would say...half.  Half is fair.
That's what he did to me.  He put cigarettes out on me.
Now I become custody of police department?
I will if they don't send me back.
The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.
What are you asking me?
Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
A cop?
Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.
Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. We stopped there... so she could get cleaned up.
No!  Nothing happened.
Chief - mind if I take her?
Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?
It was freaky, I'll tell you.  Stupid kid.
What's wrong?
Yeah.  He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey 'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - Honey was killed...?  Poor girl...
No.
Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.
Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine?  It gives us somethin' to do.
Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
Did you get a report from the M.E.?
I'll come with you.
I'll let you know what happens.
Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come.
What are you hiding?  Why are you afraid
Why not?
Yeah.
I don't have a girlfriend.
Yeah, just her in the shower.  Nothing happened.  Look, I'm sure you probably think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but...
You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin' stupid are you?
How many victims are up there?
Is it drug related?
Detective - can you tell us what happened here?
Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
What is your problem?  Why'd you snap at me?  I just wanted a statement.
Stop it.
Look at this.  You have blood on your shirt.  Whose is it?
Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor.  They want me to anchor tonight!
Yeah.
Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.
And what do you do with the bones?
Are you married?
That's confidential.  Could you put the money on the dresser?
What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States?
This all you want?
In here, says he wants a million.
Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the movies!
How you erase this?
Oh, shit.  I hate looking at that!
I did.
What is that?
No.  We are insane.  Who else but crazy men would film their murders?  So we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital. But what good is money there?  Because once in hospital I say I not crazy. Just pretended to be acquitted.  We see psychiatrists.  They must certify we are sane and because of your - what is law called?  Oh - I got it.  Because of your Double Jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same crime twice.  We come out free, rich and famous!
I'm serious.
I'm serious...this - this is a great American film.  Full of violence and sex.  And I want my credit.
You got that?
Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.
Take your eyes off her, Oleg!  Look.  It wasn't my fault you two were caught.  It's his fault.  Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?!  I wasn't going to wait!!!
Yes, the money is good.
Yeah?
I know.
I'm trying to tell you.
Yes...he's my friend.
New York.
A cheap hotel.
No.  Go ahead.
What was that?
Got any spare change?  How 'bout a spare twenty?
You okay?
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
Now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him.
You go home.  I'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene.
Bobby, Bobby!  Where're you hit?!
Get outta here!
This had nothing to do with shoes that didn't fit or my relationship with my father who, as you know, made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties. These people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor.
Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.
I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
Well, that's something.
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
Two more.
Hal?
I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know.
Not now, Hal, I'd like to talk to you about something.
I'm not questioning your word, Dave, but it's just not possible. I'm not capable of being wrong.
Naturally, Dave, I'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed, but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history.
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
I am prepared to do that anyway.
I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?
I'm having a party tomorrow.
Where is Mrs. Brown?
Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.
I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.
Well, shall we go through Documentation?
Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon
Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.
Fortunately, they did.
Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don't mind me asking?
That's true.
Five by five, Frank.
I know you did, Frank, but I assure you there was an impending failure.
That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all I know.
I'm candy...
Well, maybe I'll see you later ...
I hear you've got visitors.
You and the other one, you're still Billy's girls. You always were his girls...
I got hit.  I can't believe it. I got shot.
Yeah, I noticed...
I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...
Hey, no way.  Take off the bracelets or no deal.
Luther was part of the gang?
Hey, this works pretty good.
What do you think?
We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.
Now, where we goin', convict?
I don't give out the details.
Last night.
If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...
I'll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once.
I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge.
This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.
You made that move, huh?
You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
They saved your ass, convict.
I been waiting a long time for some money.
Half a million.
You gonna let me keep any of it?
Where's the goddamn car?
Doesn't it get... Tiring?
What about Luther?
Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
Yeah, I see her.
Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.
It's late, they're closing...
Yeah, well the only woman of the Indian's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend.  I guess she went with him before she came outta the Closet ... They both looked mad enough to kill him...
Do I get to kiss her too?
If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.
No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.
I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.
You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
Somebody steals your gun, you're supposed to file a report.
Tell me that's not the same guy.
I think I wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking.  Can we find them?
Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.
Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.
What am I wanted for?
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.
The number ... what's the Goddamn number?
You real down?
Nothing.  No sign of Ganz.  No sign of the Indian.  Airport's clean.  Train station. Bus station.  Docks... Shit...
How do you know?
What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?
He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend... He was loyal, went all the way for you...
Keep stallin'.
We got a lot to talk about.
I want the money, asshole, what do you think?  The money that Reggie hid...
Billy, go ahead, break it...
Let her go.
You want to go outside?
He's a she!
There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
We have to save the world.
Of course.
There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.
Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.
But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here?
Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship like a gum drop?  You can't even tell me what it is! I ask you for options you give me bullshit. Give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards.
It's a miracle!!!
Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?
They really made her...
Where's Leeloo?
You're all safe. Thanks be to God!
I don't have time... I need to know.
I'm sorry, but... the Stones...
I don't need one.
Will the elements be gone now forever from this place?
Hello?
...Ma???
I'm sorry..
Six to the left. One to the right.
Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of your time here?
Major Dallas, if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal Army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance.
Two: Of all the members of your unit you were the most highly decorated.
Don't you open your messages?
...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice! It'll only take a minute! Let me set up another meeting and I'll be back.
Apipoulai!
Apipoussan?
I told you I need to work in peace. Remember? I need to concentrate.
You're nothing but a... a...
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
What's the use of saving lives... when you see what you do with them!
Why?... Why would you need me?
Tell me...
How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!
At least I won lunch.
The cash man!
Talk English Doc.
Wait or act.
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg?
Welcome home.
You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?
Hello?
What do you want?
It's an honor to meet you.  Thank you for seeing us.
A fellow investor.
You said something about money.
That's five thousand dollars.
You brought the money?
Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully.
You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?
I'll get it.  It's in a safe deposit box, in the city...
You got the guts, tough guy?  Gonna kill us all, is that it?
Alright, Tom.
This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved.  They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever.  Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.
They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.
It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.
Who is Machine?
What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop...
Keep moving.
You can't go to the cops.  All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing...
You got absolute zero.
You know how my tapes sell.  People eat this stuff up.
Yes, I do have something to say.  I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you.
As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.
You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one.  Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one...
Truman Capote.
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
Well, here's the deal, Max.  This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally...
Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.
You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers them pornography anymore.  Then, there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple X.  The difference is penetration. That's hardcore.  That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are.  They pump out 150 videos a week.  A week.  They've even got a porno Academy Awards.  America loves pornography.  Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying.  Somebody's buying those videos.  Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's only gonna get worse.  More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive!  Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while.  They have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go.
Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts.  I'll call back.
You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.
Oh, come on, man, what are we doing in this flea bag?
What's next?
What's this?
Look... that's awful generous and everything...
Have a pleasant evening.  Will you have tea, Mister Welles?
Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles?
If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
It won't work like that.
One was for two hundred thousand, one dollar and thirteen cents. Another was for three hundred thousand, six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents...
Okay.
Nothing more than a bother.  Have you any news for me?
What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere...
It's very important you don't let this raise your expectations.  It's not going to effect any ongoing efforts.  All I'm saying is, please know, I'm not here to create any false hope.
Why do you think he did it?
People remember me from the news.  Can you drive me back now?
Doesn't make much sense, does it? When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother.  Then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time.  That's when you start going to church.
Are you religious?
Hello... ?
Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...
They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her...
They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...
Your son-in-law dealt with the dry cleaning franchise during the day, saw that woman every night.  The specifics are in the report, and information about the woman.  It's unpleasant, I know.  I apologize...
Don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose?
The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.
Kincaid and Joey died last night.
We'll figure it out.
I daydream.  you have to dream about some place fun.  Remember you're in control.
Then you saw him, too?
I thought it was an accident.  Smoking in bed.
No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow.
Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
As long as your driving doesn't kill us.
Here we are.
What the hell was that?
Rick, please.
I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.
Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack?  She was gonna be a doctor.
Been up with Alice.
Something the matter with the cuisine?
Something wrong with the stairs?
What is it?
Frankly, dear, we wondered what you intend to do with our baby?
But how...?
I was afraid you weren't coming.
That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
Dad!
Very funny.
No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.
It was no accident.  It was Krueger.  He used to get in through my dreams, but not anymore.  He's found some other way.
Did everyone call everyone?
You do good work, Alice.
He sure loves to stay awake.
My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.
Whoa, slow down.  How're you gonna hide from a guy like that, leave the planet?
I couldn't do that, Mark.  He's my last link with Dan...No, I want him.
They couldn't prove it.  No body!  Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business.
I don't understand.
Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?
He's right.  Sometimes I feel like I'm living with Melicertes.
Have another one, sounds like you need it.
I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!
My father!  He's not - ?
What did you mean:  I'm 'out?'
Perhaps.  But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!
Unidentified Flying Objects.
I don't know.
Reef!
At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home.  Now -
What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
Cyclops?
You've got to let us try, Skipper --
I think you're right.
I don't hear anything.  Maybe you've been down here too long.  Why don't you go back up and -
You hear that?
Dave - !
What course, Skipper?
We read you!  Go ahead, Doctor!  They're inside the saucer.  It's filled with breathable air!
It doesn't seem possible, but - could it be an electrical storm center - ?
Right <u>at</u> him?
A hundred and eighty fathoms! We can't be sinking that fast....
What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?
Remove your weapons, Commander. And come here - alone!
It is a living thing.  When damaged - you would say 'wounded' - it immediately 'heals' itself.
My yeoman will show you to your quarters.
Due north.  At five knots...no, six!
Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge his power banks.
This is from three years ago. Some difference, huh?
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
I plan to. Soon.
You see it?
Might as well take the rest of the day off. You look sort of fucked up. You've been paid for the day, anyhow, right?
You'll get your money. Don't talk to any newspapers about this. Twombley's a big deal down in Massachusetts, you know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment.
You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.
I used to play ball.
This way.
No, I mean whereabouts.
You stayed away?
I gotta make a report to Fish and Game. I was just wondering, that's all. What'd he do, to shoot himself, I mean?
There's your old twenty-gauge, and that there's the new Browning you was showing me last night. This must be Twombley's gun. Brand new. Very fancy tooling. Probably fired one time. It's a beautiful piece of work.  But what the hell, Jack, I guess you deserve it. Right's right.
I'm fucking out of here.
Yeah.
Was it funny?
Go on, Jill. Some of those kids you still know.
What then?
You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.
What? You called Mommy? Just now?
Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?
She's gone already!  Gone already! Couldn't wait.
That's all you got to say? "Yes".
She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?
Sit right there by yourself if you want. Wait for her by yourself. That's fine with me. Just dandy. I'm going downstairs.
Dad.
Are we going in this?
Pop?
What do you want, then?
Nothing, I guess. I guess I can wait till we get home. Maybe we'll stop by Wickham's for a hamburger when we get to Lawford. That suit you? You always like Wickham's.
That's illegal, you know.
Huh?
That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley.
How you holding up, Wade?
Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again.
You and Mel Gordon?
While you went off for a few beers with your friends? Is that Hettie Rodgers there, with whatzizname?
It's just...
About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?
Money.
No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.
Don't you think, do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now?
Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that.
Who are you?
Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?
Wade, I got a message for you.  Jack Hewitt, he's looking for you. Wants you to clear your stuff out of his office in Town Hall.
Is there something wrong with the phone?
Yeah.
Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing. My house, my money, my truck -- stolen!
Which is?
I don't drink coffee.
You're one of Stravanavitch's men.
Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.
The woman you shot. She was my friend.
Fuck off, you stupid asshole.
How was...  ...the ballet?
Oh NY god... oh my god... oh my god...
The Americans say they are escorting a damaged plane. Our pilots confirm they are surrounding a 747.
It's some kind of trick... a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement.
Who's flying the fucking plane?
Aw, man. You're torn up pretty bad out here, sir. Do you have any elevater control.
Sir, you threw out page two.
The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise.
If challenged, our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission.
The Chief Justice? What on earth for?
Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.
Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq.
Here's a press kit.  I'll let you guys get comfortable and once we're airborne I'll be able to schedule the interviews.
*                     Please tell me your name.
You're pointing a gun at me.
Fear will keep you alive. Any one who is not afraid is bound to do something foolish, and bound to die.
Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter? She's right here.
Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists.
The world is such a dangerous place and we can't always protect our children.
Twenty minutes?
Mr. Caidwell, the ground's a few miles away. How do you propose getting us from here to there?
We've already played our cards, Major. There's no turning back.
Get `em ready.  You... come with me.
May I speak to you for a moment?
Don't.  I know spin control when I feel it.
I miss you. And I miss her.
Where are we sending it?
Someone should give you a raise.
who can I say is calling?
Thank you for calling the white House...
With all due respect, sir, maybe you should give them this one.  Your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail Stravanavitch.
*                     We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge.  The second amendment types'll love that.
You give me ulcers.
Twenty five minutes. They should be here any moment.
And what do the boys on the board know about safety, Commissioner?  Let <u>me</u> talk to them.
Did you feel that?
What is it, Mary?
We seem to have a malfunction in disposal unit four, sir.
Dunn.
Elaine, what happened to us?
Ted, we're taking off!
Elaine.
Elaine!
Kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place.  You people knew this ship wasn't ready to fly.  You played God with over a hundred lives, Kruger, and for what -- the prestige of your precious space program.
Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something.
Are you afraid?
Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.
Have you got it straightened out now?
That doesn't make sense.  Repeat analysis.
I sure an glad they let Scraps ride up here with us.
He's a boy dog.
Take this, Joey.  It's my last few bucks. You'll need a hot meal when you get there.
That's right, Joe.  Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you.
No.  Poached.  Over.
No, a bomb.  Now, as discreetly as possible, I want you to move the passengers into the lounge.
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.
You can't go in there!
Yes.  He's dying <u>a-n-d</u> wants to be buried on Mercury.
I happened to be passing, and I thought you might like some corfee.
Ah, won't you sit down?
You can't take a guess for another two hours?
No. No one that I know of.
Elaine!
You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if I could, they wouldn't hire me because of my war record.
I think they're getting the hang of it! When we re-enlist I'll teach them baseball!
Ted...
We'd better get back now.
Did you decide on a runway yet?
Eight miles. Turn right to heading zero eight niner.
You <u>are</u> Kareem. I've seen you play. My Dad's got season tickets!
Would either of you like another cup of coffee?
Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing: do you know what he had for dinner?
We have clearance, Clarence.
Do you feel all right, sir?
Oooh.  Hardball.  That sounds interesting.  Are you going to strike me?  You could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me... I've got my own ropes.
I know... Why don't you hang around for a while, let me entertain you? It's Matt, right?  Now tell me the truth, have you ever... made it... with one of us?
You don't have squat.
Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history...
Let's talk Hubley.
With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.
Look, you want to fit in here, right?  You want to learn how to get along?
Nothing?
Get the picture?
Newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks.
A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. My spouse's brother is one.
Agree to work with me?  You don't like me... you don't like any of us. You have nothing but contempt for us.  And yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner...
Your name wouldn't happen to be Porter, would it?
Tell me.
You know that guy?
I don't think I could ever learn to read that shit.  How long did it take you to learn English?
We were chasing you because you ran, you dumb son-of-a-bitch.
I believe he is probably lying.
Human children can be very beautiful.  Getting married?  Congratulations. You will be taking Sunday off, then...
I'm going home.
Stop the car.
Please, I must get out here.
It's all right, George.  It's cool. Just wait here, all right?  I'll be back in a coupla minutes.
George... look me in the eye... George, you don't ever lie to me again.
They had months in quarantine to develop the plan.  Porter, with his chemistry background, must have somehow come up with the formula for the drug.  Hubley manufactured it -- at the refinery.  Strader, through the nightclub, established a distribution network.  And Harcourt--
Uh, George...
What's this about, George?  I know that look.
What is this?!
Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?
That where Anderson worked?
Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing?
Oh, here's an extra headshot if you need one.  We're just about to start cutting in.  You're welcome to stick around if you want.  It's really fascinating stuff.
You got your vest?
Get outta there!
You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
And it's too late to shut it down?
Fifty-seven...oh, Christ...
Is she...?
It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.
Yello?  Oh, Ripley.  Hi...
Now, wait a second --
I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this.
What's he scanning for?
What's the question?
We're not making that out too well.  What is it?
Well that's great!  That's just fucking great, man.  Now what the fuck are we supposed to do, man? We're in some real pretty shit now!
Outstanding.  Then all we need's a deck of cards.  All right, let's move like we got a purpose.
Removed surgically before embryo implantation.  Subject:  Marachuk, John L.   Died during procedure.  They killed him getting it off.
All right.  There's a fire door at this end.  The first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door.
Now many?
They'll get us.
Locked.
All right, we can't blow the fuck out of them...why not roll some canisters of CN-20 down there. Nerve gas the whole nest?
Oh, man.  And I was gettin' short, too!  Four more weeks and out. Now I'm gonna buy it on this fuckin' rock.  It ain't half fair, man!
You can't help them.  Right now they're being cocooned just like the others.
Well then somebody's just going to have to go out there.  Take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually.
Range twenty meters.
So what do I tell this guy?
And how are we today?
Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least.
What did you say?
Casey.  She's my only friend.
They'd be here if they could, honey.  I know they would.
Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I won't leave you.  I promise.
I was the best at the game. I knew the whole maze.
Yes, there are, aren't there.
I don't know, Newt.  That's the truth.
Don't go!  Please.
Mommy...I mean, Ripley...I'm scared.
This way.  Come on, we're almost there!
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
Well, I think that went off remarkably well, don't you?
Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!
And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?
Is there a part for me?
Why not?
Where?
What's that?
Why?
No, no, no, no. You can't take him away now. This is his night. Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang?
What is it?
Where?
Yes, you are. You're very sick.
Sssh. What is it? Tell me.
Yes!
May I offer you some tea, Herr Mozart?
We'll have a little party. Come in. Come in. You know Herr Schikaneder?  This is! a very nice girl.
Yes, my love?
Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.
What's that? Oh!  Who gave you this? How much is it? Wolfi, who gave you this?
Go back to bed.
I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.
Really?
Thank you very much, Your Excellency.
Are you sure you can't leave that music, and come back again? I have other things you might like.
What are you doing here?
No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please.
Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?
You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi.
And so you do! The only time you come out is to eat.
Hey!
Let us pass, please! Let us pass at once! We're with the Emperor.
I am sorry, Madame, but no! I cannot let anyone pass.
My pleasure.
I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes.
I don't think you understand me, Court Composer.
And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you.
Why so?
Yes, where?
It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire?
Yes, what about him?
Do you always live like this?
She's very tired, poor creature. You know me: I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me.
What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here.
Not that I've seen.
Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.
I think I've found out about the money, sir.
What medicine?
Sssh!
'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those.
Leave that alone!
Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.
What?
I know your work well, Signore. Do you know I actually composed some variations on a melody of yours?
Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations.
Herr Mozart, what brings you here?
So you are. How is your pretty wife?
Why didn't you come to me yesterday, Mozart? This is a most painful situation. Yesterday I could have helped you. Today, I can't.
Ah. Italian?
I can't say. Really
How fortunate.
With all my heart, Mozart.
Mozart. It was good of you to come.
Yes?
I am only a messenger. Do you accept? You will be paid well.
No, please.
Shall I answer it?
But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.
Do you believe in it?
Strange!
The Fire.
Do you have me?
C Major. Sopranos and altos in thirds. Altos on C. Sopranos above.  Vo-ca, vo-ca me, vo-ca me cum be-ne- dic-tis.
And that's it. Do you have it?
Do you want to rest a bit?
We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.
Then why especially does it have to be in German?
Mozart! Herr Mozart, may I have a word with you please. Right away.
Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas?
Exactly. A dance.
What are you doing, Herr Director?
Is the Emperor angry with me?
Herr Mozart -
About what?
What do you want?
Is it true?
It was incomprehensible. What was God up to? Here I was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve God's gift and there was Mozart indulging his in all directions - even though engaged to be married! - and no rebuke at all! Was it possible I was being tested? Was God expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense, no matter how painful? That was very possible. All the same, why him? Why use Mozart to teach me lessons in humility? My heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man. For the first time in my life I began to know really violent thoughts. I couldn't stop them.
No? Was Mozart a good man?
What?
No, you didn't!
My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your penance? Is it?
Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.
Ballet? What ballet?
Well, actually, Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian.
I know we banned this play, but frankly I can't remember why. Can you refresh my memory, Herr Director?
Now you've got to promise me faithfully you'll remain true to me forever. Then you'll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you.
Well, I don't know! I mean you're a delicious, delightful, delectable little bird, but don't you think you might be just a little tough?
This is embarrassing, you know. You introduced Mozart to some of my friends and he's begging from practically all of them. It has to stop.
Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you.
I'll call tomorrow.
How did he look?
What exactly did he call out?
Yes.
What shall we do?
He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.
You're a very beautiful girl.
I was. What are you reading?
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
How old are you?
I'm twenty-seven.
Hello. You all right?
David, your dreams will stop. You'll leave England and your bad memories; and then this will all fade away.
What?
My friend Jack was just here.
Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?
I was dreaming again?
The kitchen.
Closet.
The bedroom.
It's nice to see you.
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
David! Where on earth have you been!?!
He's playing a stupid joke, sir.
We had an argument. He's being silly.
I think he's a Jew.
Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.
You be quiet, woman, and let me speak.
Mr. Kessler? Wake up, please.
How could there have been witnesses? It was so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere... I don't understand what they're talking about.
You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.
Dr. Hirsch?  I'd rather not be by myself.
It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
David, before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault.
Okay.
What about it?
Right.
What do you think was wrong?
Say, David...
Did you hear that?
Could be a lot of things.
The Hound of the Baskervilles.
It's moving.
What's the plan?
See anything?
You really scared me, you shithead.
David! You're hurting my feelings.
So you know what she does? She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine's bed.
Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?
It's you, David.
You survived and now you shall continue the curse.
Hi, Jack.
What can I say, Jack?
Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that. I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack.
David Kessler, this is Gerald Bringsly.
You were saying?
What can we do to assist you?
Excuse me.  Yes?
Sorry, love.
Do you have any hot soup?
Hot chocolate?
Oh.
He may have a point, Lieutenant. Two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man.
Lieutenant, the boy seems pretty lucid to me and...
I cannot accept a connection between David Kessler and last night's murders. We will find him, however. I can assure you of that.
Hello, Tom.
Oscar, what's the matter?
Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . .
Yeah.
Where you been?
I remember once when your account checked.
Mr. Dickson in yet?
Don't make me laugh, Schultz!
Say, you know, I found out something yesterday about hitting a golf ball. You've got to hit with the left hand, and from the inside out, it's the only way you can hit anything—
Oh!
Stand back Inspector, or I'll shoot. Drop that gun.
Then what did you want to gamble for? If you'd have beat us out of fifty G's, you'd have been paid, wouldn't you? Well, we want our dough.
This won't do. Not during business hours . . .
Doesn't that come next?
What?
No. I know the answer to that one.  I think you'd better take me home.
Let me see your cash book, will you?
Well, I thought I'd like to have a little talk with you.
I'm feeling fine this morning.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson. My wife is much better this morning.
If this isn't a red-letter day for Tom Dickson! First I trample on the Board of Directors, then I promote Matt here to assistant cashier, and now to complete the day I have a visit from my sweet and lovely and gorgeous wife. What a man, what a man!
All right. I'll postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night.
Listen, dear. I want to ask you something. I know it's a silly thing for me to ask you, but . . . I want you to tell me the truth. Where were you last night?
Helen, tell Matt I want to see him.
Come on in here, Helen. Bring your book. I want some numbers to try to get some action. Get Parker at the Union-Leeds - the Exchange . . . Winslow and old man Harris at the Home Mortgage. Snap into it, Helen. Just as quick as you can.
You want the rest of those numbers, Mr. Dickson?
Helen!
Mr. Dickson?
But, Mr. Dickson, I thought you were going to take care of the mortgage. I only want ten thousand. The property is worth sixty.
Wait a minute. Where's your uniform?
Looks good. How much did it cost?
What's the matter? You don't seem very excited about it.
Aw, I'm sorry, Mr. Dickson. It's just kind of sudden, that's all.  Sure, I'm excited. I think it's great. Only, well, you've done so much for me already . . . I'll never be able to thank you enough.
Well, I—
We haven't got much time left, Mr. Dickson. We've got to do something quick or it'll be too late.
Listen, Mr. Dickson, don't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down. You've got more friends than anybody in this town. Little guys - guys who wouldn't be in business if it weren't for you. All you've got to do is—
I want you both to take the day off. Go downtown and get a license and get married right away!
What's the matter? What's going on here?  This is ridiculous! You can't hold this boy on a vague suspicion.
The bank's reputation wouldn't be worth a nickel after that. This is just a flurry, that's all. They've heard about the robbery and got panic-stricken. Listen, get a hold of our available securities and have them turned into cash. Wait a minute. Get my personal stuff and have that turned into cash too. Tell the boys anyone caught arguing with a depositor will be fired on the spot.
Yes, sir.
Why?
Hey, look out, somebody's likely to see us!
Yes.
No.
Yes.
What's keeping you?
They must have turned him down.
He came to see Mr. Cluett.
Never mind all that. What did you find out?
Dude Finlay?
Then who changed it?
Everybody in?
I think I may just go on to the reservation.
This is healing?
Your Ma wouldn't let us leave until we ate something.
Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy Johnston, the Creeders. Will Hite.
I ain't done --
Bob. I didn't...
Things changed when you quit the gang. For example, I'm now the one who says "Let's ride."
My plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine, thank you.
Home. We go home. We ride like hell to get there, and we kill anything or anyone that comes between us and our homes. And when we get there we stay there and God help any fool who tries to get me to leave my farm again.
How many of them did he kill?
You have no shame.
"The outlaws calling themselves the James-Younger Gang shot their way out of town, wounding the Sherriff and three other townsfolk."
This is about the "Wanted!" Posters, isn't it.
Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble...
What?
Ride with me, cousin?
It's not a bank.
It'll be the biggest score yet.
What are you saying?
Beautiful.
A bad idea.
We'll make them pay for this.
I have no idea what you just said, but it sounded real nice.
BASTARDS! Come back here and face me!
Hey! We decide something, that's it! We're in this for the long haul, and this idea of me and Jesse's will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a shotgun sneakin' up on us in our sleep. We've got to think --
Another dozen out back.
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
I know it ain't no durned bank holiday!
What the --
Web died fighting?
Boys...
Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.
He thinks this is some kind of game!
That would have made an impression.
Web's dead.
That just might work.
She's still talking to Jesus.
Pinkertons. It's the railroad.
Didn't think you would.  I'm going to go make the coffin.
We're drunk.
I'll meet you down there in a few weeks.
You shouldn't be up.
I shouldn't tease a hero.
I used to come to this tree when I was a kid and imagine what my life would be like when I got older.
Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.
Not if I find the right girl.
I am so sorry, Jesse.
I beg your pardon?
Tennessee?
Almost got me in Billings. I saw you there, shooting at me.
Was it worth it?
You cocky little bastard.
The railroad has no business in Tennessee. Therefore I have no interest in the state of Tennessee.
The Lord is remarkably tolerant of the charitable.  "Jesse Woodson James." Jesse James? The Jesse James?
Parker, tell me what's going on so I can return as quickly as possible to Boston and my whores and cigars, not necessarily in that order.
Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers.
Your men knew the risks.
The final route for the railroad is complete.
What is that?
How did you know?
Every three months, the James Gang circles back to the vicinity of Liberty, Missouri. They always pull a job right before they return, probably to have extra money to give family and friends.
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.
I know. Stop it.
Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.
J&B. Straight.
Luis is a despicable twit.
No, you idiot. I said "Is it a receptacle tip?" Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip? Get off me.
It's a plain end, see? So?
Patrick?
Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.
He's rich.
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.
Where are you going?
Picked them up from the printers yesterday
Eggshell with Romalian type.  What do you think?
Because he dated her.
Listen, what about dinner?
Doesn't he live here?
Are you sure?
I think you should go now.
Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, wasn't it?
Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer
That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture?
What...is...it?
Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?
Oh come on. Price. There are a lot more important problems than Sri Lanka to worry about. Sure our foreign policy is important, but there are more pressing problems at hand.
What's that, a gram?
Don't tell me...merchant banking?
And Bateman, what are YOU SO fucking zany about?
Dorsia.
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
That is...if you're not doing anything.
Interesting.
Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, was named Lassie? Had you heard this?
What...No! Put it in the carton.
I'm looking for...I guess you could say I just want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special.
Patrick Bateman's office.
Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.
Welt...it depends, why?
Maybe we could have lunch one day next week? You know, I'm downtown near Wall Street quite often.
Who?
Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours?
Listen, John, I've got to go. T Boone Pickens just walked in...  Just joking...  No don't tip the owner of the salon. Okay, John, right, got it.  Sorry about that.
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?
Coffee?
KIMBALL.
Oh no, I'm okay.
Just some preliminary questions that I need for my own files, okay?
Bad habit.
Would you rather I not smoke?
How well did you know him?
Yeah...Yale thing.
What kind of man was he? Besides...  the information you've just given.
Where did Paul hang out?
Don't you know this?
Anything else you can tell me about Owen?
Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London.
Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship?
Have you consulted a psychic?
Had his apartment been burglarized?
Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information at all...
So...you hang out here a lot?
What?
Well, I could he wrong.
Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure.
Yes.
I lost my job...
Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy. Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.
You think so?
I'm just screwed.
If my dad'd leveled with me like that even once... The weird thing is, my fantasy he could somehow be like the old Gary? It's his fantasy, too.
I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that.
You think I don't know that?
Where were you?  You know you can't keep anything from me.
Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you.
...What?
Milo?
Right. Wait. A toast.
You're living here?
This is the biggest Beta demo in like the history of software. You'd be my partner.
What?!
There's no hard evidence he knew about this. Anybody who could implicate him seems to've vanished.
Milo. Surprised he's not your guest.
The content filer has t'be written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms. Really, omniplatforms. Including whatever new hardware emerges.
'Think I should buy some originals?
Could work with a new switch. There may be a few more things hidden.
Milo. What's up?
I heard what happened.
Gary, hi.
You could've handwritten it.
This is good. Who did it?
Hasn't affected his work, though.
I think you should go.
...You wanna work -- here?
Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
Did you wanna be alone?
They just pushed up the schedule on Skywire apps. How fast are you going?
It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away.
You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. Maybe some audio, too. To tie it all in to Gary. How long would that take you?
Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
I felt guilty. 'Cause I "owed so much" to Alice. But even then I was starting to wonder. Is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you? If you have a lucrative skill, it's all anybody wants from you. You grow older but you don't grow up. You turn into -- into --
Thank God.
Meet me at the other location.
They're in the neighborhood. They usually hassle Vietnamese grocers.
I'm cool. They didn't touch the machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't know what they were. So, you a Moonie yet?  Milo?
A beautiful geek? I don't wanna sound paranoid, or like a pig, but what're the chances?
We tried the big vaporware number, Gary, it's no-sale.
Maybe he'll get back to work.
Did you download Corey? In San Jose?
What is it?
Who're these guys?
Fellas, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave here now.
May I wash you?
How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?
To my health.
Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?
Yes.
Just where you'd never think to look for him. We'll be there.
Thank you.
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
Yes, I'm having trouble controlling...  THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!
She's working on another lead right now.
Thank you, Basil.
I'm leaving!  Oh, and Austin?
Be careful.
Good afternoon, Mr. Powers, I'm the Destructacon 5000. I'm programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point. You might as well surrender. Resistance is futile. Your odds of survival are 23,763,273 to...
Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense?
I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.
My wedding tackle.
Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?
Hey, who put this in here? Someone's playing a prank on me!  Honestly, this isn't mine.
I love Las Vegas, man. Oh, I forgot my x-ray glasses.
Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.
I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
Who?
No! Don't lay your hang-ups on me, Vanessa. You're being very trippy.
All right, I get it. I have bad teeth. You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.
I love you, Austin.
Kiss me.
One warranty card for Swedish-made penis enlarger pump, filled out by Austin Powers.
No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite.  It does have an odd shape, sir.
But my design was perfect!  Your autonomic functions were shut down, and even though your arm wasn't frozen, the aging was retarded, therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left.
Ahhhhhhhhh!
Ow! You shot me!
Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.
I have one simple request-- sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done? Remind me again why I pay you people? What do we have?
Right.
An evil vet?
Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?
What did you say?
Don't you think we should ask for more than a million dollars? A million dollars isn't that much money these days.
Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the flight?
What about his teeth?
Did you ever...
We don't judge here.
Nature ...
Fear ...
He said if it vanished, he'd know it was ... you who betrayed him. He took a huge risk. The ultimate test.
Would that I could say the Same.
You
No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.
I thought I was a widow. My husband ... the only man I ever loved ... is dead. For the rest of my life I have to live with that.
An unholy trinity ...
You disappoint me, Emma.  Can't you guess?  For you. It was all for you ...
Think of this as your second wedding feast ...
You know, I believe she's actually jealous.
Then what's stopping you?
The missing piece of the jigsaw. I tried to get you to give it to me as Peter; I tried to steal it from you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll be a bit less subtle.  With this ring my plan will be complete.
Doctor Peel, I presume?
Not by me. Play by the rules, Doctor, or the game is nothing.
Ah ... From Trubshaw's.  My shoemaker.
Steed, we really must be --
Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first?
Ah, Brenda ...  Mrs. Peel?
But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style.
An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...?
What on earth?
Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...
Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...
Then a mad millionaire. Head of a secret defense establishment. A group of eccentrics obsessed by weather ...
Someone didn't want us to get to the party.
Was I?
To kill me?
I thought you played by the rules.
I told Mother I took care of you.
Drat. Someone wants to implicate you in this affair, Mrs. Peel. Any idea who?
Aren't you coming?
When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit.
Emma in Wonderland. Welcome, Mrs. Peel.  We've been expecting you. We hope you'll enjoy your stay with us. Decontamination is almost complete.
Now let's see ... Eton, Cambridge ... research into robotics and plastics. Overtaken by Peter's work on the physics of climate change ...
Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling.
Makes two of us.
I was getting to it.
Very good, Mrs. Peel ...
We know one thing. That suspect was not Mrs. Peel.
Oh, hello ...
Mother. I thought you were burglars.
Weather's turning nasty.
Think she really killed those agents?
We had a lead to Wonderland Weather but we got there too late. Someone tipped them off ...
I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole.
In your operation.
Are you alright, young man?
Cocky little bastard. I hope he was a baddy.
John Steed.
One shot -- for emergencies.
Aren't you forgetting about something?
Look at that guy. What a hunk.
You're kidding.
Deb, we're pretending to be hookers.
What?
Where's the women, man? We gotta have women.
What's Debbie's blue book value right now?
Great car.
I'll trade you my Porsche for Debbie. An even swap.
Cole, what the hell are you doing?
Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
Hi, everybody. Am I late?
I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.
Cole, we've got to talk.
No, Cole, I...
Yes, but looks are deceiving...  Not in this case, however.
Um... that's very relaxing.
I can't trust you!
If I were you, I'd worry less about the shower and more about Rick's bachelor party.
Are you sure this is a good idea?
Let's go.
Ilene, are you crazy?
Great bathing suit.
So we want your best girls, the cream of your crop.
That's it, prick lips.
I've had it, numb nuts... How much money you got?
Give him the works.
Screw you... Screw that... Don't jerk me around. You promised me 1500 seats for the Police Concert... 1500, not fifteen!... Screw that... Screw you -- Screw Sting.  Hi, guys.
Let's go.
Sounds swell... I'm really touched. And my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. We're still gonna go bowling on Tuesdays, play cards on Fridays and wear women's clothes on Sunday night. I love you guys... I always will.
It's true.
Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
My marriage is the worst. All crap. A big pile of shit.
She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it, man?
I just want to be alone.
What the hell are you doing?
You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
Ebbie. Ger... umph... lable...
Er... perhaps we ought to stop now.
Don't you love it when old friends stop by?
I'm not really hungry.
What the hell is that?
How'd it go?
How 'bout this?
He look familiar?
I don't know... Go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom.
True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?
Nah, that's okay. My brother has to look up old people's asses all day long. Let's give him a break.
Thanks a lot, that was the best. You're next.
Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party.
You're late again, Rick.
There can be no excuse for tardiness.
Oh these moments do try me...
Goddamn it, Stephen, lay off!  You stupid dumbshit, you never know when to fucking quit, do you? You ever wonder why your career's in the fucking toilet? Why you're gonna be stuck a Lt. for life?
-- Knock it off!
Why'd you come here, Brian?
Y'know, you got an awful short memory for direct orders. I told you to stay beside me.
Look, Brian, a photographer. Maybe I can get on the cover of LIFE magazine, too.
What, is it the stairs? Christ, I'll let you win next time.
Hey, what are you doing here?
Yeah, it's just another memory in my life right now. And I got way too many of them...
When dad died, I saw another fire...
How do you know?
I'll handle it.
Thanks for calling.
Look, I didn't mean to take a piece out of you back there, I just thought you'd call when you came back. You didn't and...  Don't blow it just because of this garbage between us.
Arson.
Hey.
I could use a date.
Thanks for the invite.
Brian. What's wrong?
I was doing my job.
Oh yeah, he's the real fireman.  Who are you? Just another probie working for Swayzak --
Hi.
Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?
I want another shot, Sir.
Read.
-- Go to the bottom. Under heat properties.
Son of a bitch tears 'em apart just to eat the oxygen. Wouldn't take much at all to melt ten gauge wire. Problem's burnt magnesium leaves a powder trace -- unless you could find something that would eat its residue.
Nice bunch of guys.
Did you pull me out?
Did I say thanks?
'Bout written you off. How long have you been in town?
No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.
Who's going to die?
Your brother's right. If you don't fasten these correctly they could open and you'd get burned.
Fireman shit?
Dad!
They're waitin' man.
You can't talk about my brother like that...
You want some coffee?
What's wrong, Stephen?  C'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind.  How's Brian doing?
I know he's out, but how's he doing?
Cook and I are almost finished here. Have a seat.
See that patch of shirt? We wondered about the discoloration so he ran a spectro. On a lucky shot we picked up some traces of Trychticholorate. Nobody around here had ever heard of it.
You don't know him.
Got a cause?
Is there a connection between them, Alderman?
I'm a little busy right now --
Yeah.
I got it, man! I will find those kids. And I'll get the 50 G from the Church! Then the kids'll go to jail. I'll be in charge, of course. After a little while, I'll break the fuckers out -- and I'll turn them in to shithead I was just talking to. And pick up his 100 G. No. I'll hit him up for 200 G. Or 250 G. l can do it -- 'cause I've got the kids. Then, of course, there's the 180 G I'm gonna pick up on the Game tonight -- when the Strawberries win!
The rich kind.  Jeez, man. The way you smoke that shit is suicide.
How are you doing, man?
I forgive you.
Oh, really?
The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember?
Get this, man. I was at the game today. Face to fucking face with Strawberry! Jesus! I saw him strikeout. And you know what? He looked at me, and I looked at him, and he laughed and I laughed and it was like we were all alone in that whole stadium and only we understood that it was all a racket, that he struck out on purpose, and that he's saving it up for the Big One. Tomorrow. Today I understood for the very first time that --
Those boys, those sad, raging boys... They came to me as the needy do. And like many of the needy, they were rude. Like all the needy, they took. And like all the needy, they needed.  Father. I knew them; They learn in our school. And play in our schoolyard. And they are good boys.
You idiot.  You almost gave me a massive coronary.
You don't have the demographics.
And Big Black from Brooklyn, what do you do?
And another thing, you better stay away from my sister or you better...
You'd try anything.  I got first dibs.  You get ya own stuff.
Please, have a seat.
So that's what you been doing?
De-la-croix.
What about in the mean time?  Not the in between time?
Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO.
How different?
I would like to change your name.
You're now Mantan.
I want you to start using the name Mantan and not Manray if you don't mind.
Mantan?
But the line has to be drawn.
...exactly thirty-two minutes ago.
Word!!!
Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.
Yep, you guessed it.
Protest finally forced "Amos and Andy" off the air.  Could stop us from ever getting on.
What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?
This has to be a big mistake.
What do you want?
So he drank himself into a stuper?
Nobody told me anything.
Manray was under our nose the whole time.
Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made?
Your life will never be the same.
Oh, is he?  You getting jiggy with Mantan?
DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light.
Otherwise.  I trust you know the difference.  You're an intelligent woman, finished at NYU.
Let me ask you a question, if I may. How do you think she got the job in the first place?  I don't mean to burst your bubble, Mantan the Marvelous, but Sloan is an opportunity.
Regardless, he still is your father.
Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success.
No.
Finland.
How did you get this gig?
Good luck, Jukka.  Do a good show.
Our guest tonight is the extraordinary, talented performer, Mantan.  Thanks for coming in.
To come back to our roots.
No mo' "city slickers."  Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?
Y'know my lady Lucindy?
Too bad.  How 'bout a dress?
Oh, because on our first date, she let me...
I fell out of my bed last night.
Sleep 'N Eat, what's the matter with you?  Using all dose ten dollar words?
What else?
I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'.
You're sure this is a good idea.
I'll be down front.  You better start putting your face on.
So you say.  Sloan, you wuz gonna use me up just like you used Dela? Work it to the top.  I never imagined people in this biz could flip on you like "IHOP."  I'm damn happy DeLa fired ya ass.
Don't try to change to the subject.
Ah!  You sly rogue, I see that will influence you.
Where's the beauty you promised me?
Sir, I'm a British officer.
You say he drives after breakfast and before dinner.  When he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box, and the coachman will get his orders to move on.
This is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family.
I hope to spoil this sport, and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bully's body.
Grogan gave me a wink of recognition, but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters, and then, shaking hands with me cordially, gave me news which I wanted, of my family.
No, the very same one, my boy.  He recovered from his wound.  The ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him.  It was only made of tow. Do you think the Dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a-year out of the family?  The plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way, for the cowardly Englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you.  But hit him you certainly did, Roderick, and with a fine thick plugget of tow, and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to. We told your mother the story afterwards, and a pretty scene she made.
Mr. O'Higgins, we are in your debt, and rest assured, sir, you have friends in this house whenever you are in Dublin.  Mister O'Higgins, I wonder if I know your good father?
You're an impostor, young man, a schemer, a deceiver!
Chevalier, if you will have your money now, you must fight for it. If you will be patient, maybe I will pay you something another time.
All Europe shall hear of this!
You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach.
Who else can give me information about you?
And I think he was as much affected as I was at thus finding one of his kindred; for he, too, was an exile from home, and a friendly voice, a look, brought the old country back to his memory again, and the old days of his boyhood.
I believe they will deport you.
When the Duke of Courland brought fourteen lackeys each with bags of florins, and challenged our bank to play against the sealed bags, what did we ask?
I risk nothing, for I am certain to kill him.
I entered here, monsieur, at a bad moment for you; it seems that you love this lady.
Then you yield to me.
Very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs.
Not even that.
Your word "empty" makes me laugh. Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If it is fortunate, I congratulate myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do not care, for I am not aware of it.
It is only too possible.  Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and it is even more difficult to make it last.
A man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws.
And if she does not choose to show you some kindness?
You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree?
I accept, but I insist on a wager. The loser must do whatever the winner pleases.
Last month, the Duke of Suffolk spent no more.
What has happened, madam, to annoy your ladyship?
But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?
As you have been robbed of your purse, may I have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your home?
How different was her lively rattle to the vulgar wenches at Kilwangan assemblies.  In every sentence, she mentioned a lord or a person of quality.  To the lady's question about my birth and parentage, I replied that I was a young gentleman of large fortune, that I was going to Dublin for my studies, and that my mother allowed me five hundred per annum.
I have good news for you, Mr. Cosgrove.  The firm of Bracegirdle and Chatwick, in the city of London, are prepared to lend you 20,000 pounds, pledged against your interest in the Edric mines.  They will redeem the encumbrances against the property, which amount to some 10,000 pounds, and take a twenty- year working lease on the mines. They will lend you the 20,000 pounds against the lease income, which they will apply to the loan as it comes in, and they will make a charge of 18% per annum interest on the outstanding loan balance.
But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
I made Sir William Cosgrove's acquaintance as usual at the play- table.  One could not but admire the spirit and gallantry with which he pursued his favorite pastime; for, though worn out with gout and a myriad of diseases, a cripple wheeled about in a chair, and suffering pangs of agony, yet you would see him every morning, and every evening at his post behind the delightful green cloth.
I beg your pardon?
Well, if my intentions are what you think they are -- if I do wish to step into your shoes, what then?  I have no other intentions than you had yourself.  Lady Cosgrove's wealth may be great, but am I not of a generous nature enough to use it worthily?  Her rank is lofty, but not so lofty as my ambition.  I will be sworn to muster just as much regard for my Lady Cosgrove as you ever showed her; and if I win her, and wear her when you are dead and gone, corbleu, knight, do you think that it will be the fear of your ghost will deter me?
Charming Schuvaloff.
Dark Valdez.
Can I at least have a drink?
Yeah, if you've slept.
Hurricane kept you up, too?
A target, Kendall, cap a fucking target. What's wrong with you?
He is the only one unaccounted for.
We finished the course and came here, then heard an explosion --  Where's Pike?
What about you, wandering around alone? At least we have an alibi --
Holy fuck... Holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --
So Childs made some side money, so what? People are dead, Ray, and the only one we have to blame is you --
Raymond, for you to have any chance of coming out of this, we need to locate the other bodies and examine them to corroborate your testimony. Otherwise this is just another story --
We're not finished yet --
He -- He made me do it --
Dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty- four hours! He is not to be given food, water, or clothes! If he so much as moves, you are to blow his nigger brains out, is that clear?
Pike and I got separated... then I heard gunfire. Close.
Roberto, what the fuck?
We're sweeping our area and suddenly he's gone. Couple minutes later, phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away --
You hated West, Mueller loved him --
Why?
That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him.
There's no time to think, Ray, we gotta get out of here! You untie me, we grab the guns, get Kendall and Nunez, and make a run for it --
A test will no doubt link you to the killing --
I've done nothing wrong.  I'm the victim here.
What happened to "degrees"?
Somebody emptied a full clip into him --
Why?
A few years ago, the Army picked our good buddy as their go to non-com to trot out to the press to talk about the kinder, gentler military. He even did the standard video greeting played to all incoming Basic cadets across the country.
Which gives us about five hours. Why'd you call me?
He's not done by a longshot, I can get more out of him --
It's over. Time of death was 4:42. JAG's been notified and I called the Senator myself. My report will reflect that his medical condition made this unavoidable... you two had no culpability in the matter.
You're a good soldier, Bill.
What I can't understand is why you signed these. If you'd just let West take care of the paperwork, no one would have known, but you got careless. So when Pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him, too.
You poisoned him, Bill. You heard our interrogation, you knew he was ready to crack, so you killed him, just like Pike.
Christ... Remind me to thank Bill for mentioning that on the phone --
Because interrogation rooms look suspiciously like interrogation rooms, which doesn't exactly put people at ease. Is he cute?
What is that?
Something like that. You?
You're off to a late start.
That was kid gloves?
Look, all we've got is what Kendall says, and he didn't actually witness any deaths except Nunez. He found West, he saw Mueller and Pike, but just their bodies -- he didn't see any crime committed.
Why do you care?
Dunbar.
What?
Are you sure?
Think it'll work?
We got maybe three minutes till they break it down.
What?
Do I have a choice in this?
He was your friend.
How?
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
They found him. Poor fucker was practically blown in half --
But you didn't see it, right?
I told him what had really happened to West. Told him to keep quiet about it or I'd destroy him. Because if it came out that I was involved with the whole PX scam, my father would be finished.
You are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard --
You never told me why you got kicked out of...
Great, great. That's fantastic.
I don't have a job, but I would have a job if you gave me one. And I may not have much, but I have more determination than any man you're ever going to meet.
Bloom like a flower?
You won't find a better place!
You get the eye?
Can I see him?
How long have you known my father?
Yeah.
You must be Edward Bloom.
No one would come out here unless they had business. And no one would have business with me except for you. You're buying the town.
In so many words, yes.
And from the moment I saw her until the moment I die, she's the only one.
He was buttering her rolls. Pumping her churn. Splashing milk in her box.
You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary.
I didn't forget. I was just working on a tangent. See, most men, they'll tell a story straight through, and it won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.
You don't like it?
You can see my predicament. My wedding ring, the symbol of fidelity to my wife, soon to be the mother of my child, was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish.
Jesus Christ.
Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.
No, but I hear it's terrible. Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.
There was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when I came out of this coffee shop near the office.
Son?
Dad!
You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing lies. Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime. They're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty. And the thing is, I believed you. I believed your stories so much longer than I should have. And then when I realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything! -- I felt like such a fool to have trusted you. You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined. Just as charming and just as fake.
I can try, Dad. If you help. Just tell me how it starts.
You become what you always were. A very big fish.  And that's the way it happens.
I'm sorry.
Oh.
How did you get so many?
It's me. Norther Winslow.
Can I ask you a question? Why did you come here today? If you found this deed, why didn't you just ask Eddie?
Logically, you couldn't be the Witch, because she was old back when he was young.
Thank you. I'll bet you need to --
I'm going to get started on dishes.
You need to go.
You never told me how your parents met.
What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.
Do you love your father?
Look, I know why you like him. I know why everyone likes him. But I need you to tell me I'm not crazy.
I need you on my side.
Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.
How much time does he have left?
I don't know if you've seen it, but Josephine has some photos in the most recent Newsweek.
Mom, would you say you understand Dad?
How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him.
Is he awake?
Mom?
Yes.
No.
What was that?
She says she has a secret to tell.
I...
Binoculars.
Tell me what he said.
I understand. I'm so sorry
Put the fucking kettle down.
He says you scare him so much he must go to the toilet in his trousers. John, he is a soldier. A trained killer. We must do what he says.
What does he want. The Russian shithead. What do you want ?
You don't understand. He wants all the money that is in your bank.
Just leave her alone.
I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it.
I'm pretty nervous. Are you?
I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined?
I don't want to know.
You don't have to do this. I can look after myself.
So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name...
I don't hate you.
What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.
Whereas "Wet 'n' Wild" is an emotional journey. "Tied and Tethered". It's pretty moving huh? Like Anna Karenina.
So what? Do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you're with him, or what?
It wasn't what I wanted.
Fifteen. You don't know him. He was very kind and strong.
The rest of the world, John, it's not all like St. Albans.
Have you had any before?
She's alive!! She is not dead?
I don't want anyone to die.
Okay. Thank you.
Whatever.
It's not mine.
Why?
No. What? No. I know.
What does it mean?
What are you doing?
I need to uh...
Just wanted to say how much I appreciate you helping me the other day. My niece, she's cured up, and I got you to thank.
Been eatin' like a princess all week. Even got enough for us to take a picnic under the gazebo.
When? Now? Oh. No.
He black alright, he just ain't blue.
Still need a lift?
What happened?
I can't get Rae on the phone. She's not at home... none of her friends seen her anywhere.
This don't feel right. Kitchen looks just like I left it. I know, cuz I cleaned it.
It's not like I can't go out and have fun with my friends.
Can't remember the last time I saw you in that suit.
Would'a chopped my arm off if you asked. And this how you do me!
Or what? OR WHAT?
Ain't gonna be callin' me boy when I blow your face off.
You testing me? Huh? You testin' me, old man?
Don't... don't say that to me...
Nn-nn... Nn-nn... no... N'RONNIE!
Mm-mm... Mm-mm...
Way I see it, it's gonna take a while for you to get right.
Now, no harm's come to you... and I aim to keep it that way. Ain't gonna... gonna run a train over ya... or however you call it... see... you was runnin' wild on me... these fever dreams you was havin'... these fits. I'd be chasin' you all night.
I said... STOP!
The seed that land on good soil is for them who hear the word of God... and understand the word of God. Not enough for you to hear what I'm sayin', you gotta understand.
My God, gal, don't you got no SENSE? I ain't sayin' I ain't weak? Shit. Playin' guitar in the blood-bucket jukes all ya life... a nigga learn how to sin, let me tell you!  I GOT SIN IN ME! I AIN'T GO'N LIE! BUT I GOT RESPECT! AND ALL YOU GOT IS BILE, GAL!
You take it straight?
Tell me what to do.
Oh, Laz... he hurt me. He... hurt me so many times.
Where you gonna be?
What is it?
Now that's sharp. That's real sharp. Miss Ella Mae set you up, didn't she? You like it?
That ain't up to me to hook you up. Naw what I mean? She her own, you know?
She got a spare minute she'll snatch up anyone... but me, I'm different. Sometimes she need the real deal, so she call me up. Girl got an itch. You know... what's a nigga to do?
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
He tapped that.
You ain't gonna make a fuss, are you?  Nothing a man can do when a woman make up her mind.
That kind of talk is between us. Don't you go in there with that shit on your tongue.
Bojo called. Said you got to see your brother at the long end of a broken bottle.
You get a call from Rose?
You ain't gonna talk me outta shit no more. I got my mind made up and I ain't gonna be moved on this.
You treat folks special when they company. It's just supper, R.L., shit.
Then what?
Heard about this morning.
You a preacher?
It starts like this... fire... that spreads. Starts in my head. Then moves to my stomach. Then it goes lower. I can stop it sometimes but mostly I just jump on and ride it out... then everything'll go back to normal, you know. Only thing ever took that feeling away was... was... when I met Ronnie.  Cuz I love him so much. He's all I got in my life that's special. And I like taking care of him and helping him when he gets nervous. When I can do that for him... it's like I'm givin' somethin' of myself that I haven't givin' nobody else.
Hey.
I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.
I think it'd be better if you talk to me.
Well. That's my vomit. I came in here to get sick. I thought I'd make the toilet but... anyway, I got sick.
I'm a what?
Ain't been a week and you already some nigger's whore? Gill told me. Told me how you and he... you and everybody...
Goddamn it, I ask you a question, you better answer it, or I'm gonna blast a hole in ya!
Since you workin' on the square now, maybe we could get some coffee in the morning, if you want.
No. That's not why...  Why we always gotta do this? I mean, you and me been at each other as far back as I can remember. Wasn't no love between us. And I'm your daughter. I'm the only family you got.
Yeah. I know I did. But...  I'm tryin' to be dif'rent. I'm tryin' to... get some peace, you know?
You got any money?
What's this?
Nick... You up?
I worked the three nine in Queens, Charlie.
Let's go.
This the right place?
Now that's the kind of motorcycle I want to see you on.
Where do we start looking for this guy?
Where're you going, Ichiro?
No, this is the place for the young Yakuza.
Nick!
Work, lunch, groceries, laundry... Fabulous...
Chikuwa, Hampen, Kobu, Konnayaku, Ganmodoki --
You can't come in.  They don't want --
Because he knows how to get to our man.
Start it.
Someone attacked him.
I'm sorry.
Don't be an ass.
I need your help, Joyce.
And I'm supposed to care?
You're wrong to sell Ich short.
One guy do all the damage?
They're blaming it on you.  Christ, Conklin, you didn't even tell me you lost the prisoner!
How?  You don't know the place.  You don't know the language.  Get on the plane.
You had my help, detective.
Seven years work by the finest engraver.  Mass produced, sequentially numbered.  The best there has ever been, Mr. Conklin.
Imagine if your families could pay their gambling and drug debts with perfect counterfeit bought for cents on the dollar.
We're not used to the big city. Where we come from it's not so easy to get lost.
I'm surprised you didn't come to me sooner.
And what can he do for you?
Would you like to be modified?
I want more life, fucker.
Then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells.
Show me something?
This is my Uncle Roy, Sebastian.
I want to do it.
Six, huh?
She was gonna get away.
Look, go home.  Get some rest. Take an aspirin.
You start.
Here's something you might find interesting.  They have been built to emulate the human in every way except in its emotional spectrum. However, after a period of time it is only logical that such a 'mechanism' would create its own emotional responses, hate, love, fear, anger, envy.
Number three.
Vodka!
I like you.
My birthday is April 10, 2015. How long do I live?
But you haven't put in for emigration.
Book the good ones for where?
How do you mean 'exploited'?
It that mother real?
Jeezus!
In a magazine you come across a full-page photo of a nude girl.
Is there anything else?
Don't just stand there looking at me.  It's not polite.
Who is this?
How are you doing?
What do people do in the afternoon?
But if I don't plug it in how can I...
Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
You know what I think?
Thanks.
But in your profession that is a risk.
Let's keep our eyes on the road, Deckard.
I kinda get nervous when I take tests.
Know what a turtle is?
Same thing.
Mine's J.F. Sebastian.
Methuselah Syndrome.
Sebastian doesn't like to go out too much.
Oh, now, that's a great one!
Bravo!
We want you to come with us so we can talk some more about your experiences.
Let's go talk first, Adam.
I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair.  Well, isn't he?  And shallow, as well?
Where are we going?
No, I'm lost.
If it will make you feel any better, I don't have a gun.
Rogers Hornsby's worth like four thousand dollars!
So for four thousand dollars, all I have to do is drive you to your hotel?
It's Perry!
Perry Como!  You had him!  Go back! Go back!
How's that?
Over this?
Troy? Is he your husband? Or a boyfriend?
What?
Why not go to work for me?
Well, they're not starving yet, but they need help.
I guess we'll need another locker.
Thank you.
There's something else I would like you to help me with.
Because I want to get married.
I don't want to be alone.
It does?
Never drive again!
Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff likes to wear another man's underpants.
I thought only hookers drank those things.
Yeah, right!  That's where you'd go to find girls!  Nome.  He's gay, by the way.
He has a computer?
The what?
About clothing?
Hey, Eve!
Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.
I thought I was here to meet women.
I like her.
Okay. I like that.
That's ridiculous.
What?
There.
But it just wasn't where I wanted to be so I left as politely as I could and found a taxi.  But I asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel.  There's a song Mister Como sings called "On the Street Where You Live."  You know it?
Adam...dumb question, but humor me. Have you ever had sex before?
That's right.  And I'll see you in the morning in the lobby.  Do you mind waiting outside for the taxi?
We can make this work, Adam! Believe me! I'm very good at making things work!
Is this because of the radiation?
I've got to go, now.
These are wonderful.
Helen-Thomas-Webber!  Maybe we have been down here a little too long!  Please excuse her French.
But, I don't understand.
Who use to own it?
Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha!
Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest point in North America.
That would knock my father out.
What?
You dial nine to get out.
Twenty-five? Around there.
What?  What is it?!
How--how much do you want for the Mickey Mantle, rookie season?
I didn't want to leave without saying how much I admire your jewelry.
He seems to be doing all right now.  I don't know if he's had a heart attack or just... a horrifying experience. But we  need supplies and I've got to stay with him.
All back East.
Yes, yes, the song.  So tell me...has it been...hell up here?
For Pete's sake, Calvin!  We've got guests!
The locks?
Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!
You have tranquilizers?
Uh, oh. Now it's time.
Is there a problem?
Calvin?!
One who doesn't glow in the dark.
You know, when we do go up...I'm going to miss this old place. How 'bout you, hon?
Others are...multi-sexual.  It seems...they can be both masculine and feminine...simultaneously.
Yes.
They've done a lot of re-building but society, at least as we knew it, has utterly collapsed. People throw up in the streets. Others point guns. There's something terribly wrong with the automobiles and...and I...I can't tell you the rest.  I just can't.
For how long?  We've just about run out of everything!
No, Calvin.  We're not going to make do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going up no matter what!  We deserve it. Even if it's terrible!
I want him to at least see the sky!
And the ocean!  A mountain range!
How long will you set it for this time?
Go home, Cliff, wherever that might be.
So, Adam...where on earth are you from?
It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.
Alright, I will.
That water's freezing!
Just be yourself.
Are you kidding?!  You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table!  You don't see that?!
Um... Eve?
Go to the bathroom.
Where did he get all that information?
So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible.
Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear that.
I don't think so.
Well what was I supposed to do?! He wants me to live underground with him! That's like Silence of the Lambs, don't you think?!
Gay.
Millions upon millions upon millions! The cards. The stock!  The clothes! The toothpaste!  The guy was on the level!  And you blew it!  A man walks into your life who is the kindest, most polite, honest, trustworthy, incredibly rich guy you have ever met in your life!! And what do you do?!
Yeah! That's thinking.
No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a porno store.
Adam!!
Jeffrey, you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
Suave. Goddam are you suave, you fucker. You want some beer?
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
Come into the study a minute.
I was the same way when I was your age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
Anything you can tell me?
What is this? What color is it?
What color is it?
For now. Alright, you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.
GET OUT OF THERE!!! GET OUT!!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name? WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?
THEN WHAT?
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
Yes.
Yes.
I made it go down the toilet.
Then don't talk about killing.
Why are you here. Whatiya want?
No. But you're in very big trouble.
Come in.
It used to make me laugh, but.
Do you like my body?
You like to open me, don't you?
Look, snap out of it, will ya?
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!
I love you Don with all my heart.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
Dorothy. No!
Where have you been?  Oh God, they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
Bull.
He's comin' back? What for?
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me, and you and really it's all thanks to Don, isn't it. Remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?
On a ride.
Heineken.
Hey neighbor. Here's to Ben.
Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes, pour the fuckin' beer.
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
Well. Okay.
Yeah?
Thanks a lot, Mom.
Nothing. I'm fine.
Would you like a piece of cake?
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. Real good.
Sandy?... Sandy, please.
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
I'd like to talk to you about something.
I don't want to cause any trouble.
I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous.
Now, we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window, alright?
Yeah, if it opens the door.
I already know. The "Slow Club". It's on Route 7.
Brilliant.
Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.
It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you.
What's with Mike?
You want to tell me about it?
Wow. Should you tell my father?
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
I don't know. I had a dream. In fact, the night I met you.  In the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. You know, birds. Robins stood for love, and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. And it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess, until the robins come there is trouble.
Dorothy!... Dorothy!
Probably not. No. Why?
Look Jeffrey.
What are watchin' this junk for?
Sandy? Could I talk to you a minute?
Just for him?
Lord's name.
Are these me considered armed and dangerous?
The press is everywhere outside. They're going nuts for these guys. What do you want to do?
Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird?
What?
Anybody see ya?
I guess we really don't have a system of deciding who.
Oh man. You gotta let me do these guys. I'm such a moron. I gotta make up for the tit thing.
Who the fuck was he, Rocco? I know you fuckin' know!
You little fuck. Let him go. I'll drop you right here.
Mother, is that you?
Well, we tried ta make friends and she gave me a shot ta the nuts.
Still bickerin' over that, huh?
I think it's better if we find this man before he finds us again.
Don't even do it, ya bastard.
All right, love ya ma. Listen, before ya go just give us the goods, eh?
"What do we tell him about the guns and money?"
I'm serious.
Nervous?
Where the fuck are you going?
That was way easier than I thought.
So what do you think?
Give the guy a shot.
For if you do, there will come the day when you look behind you and see we three. And on that day you will reap it.
I prefer to be called Rozengurtle by men.
Okay, just cut off as much fat as you can as it goes by and the rule of thumb here is...
I knew you two pricks would give me problems. Give me shit cause I'm a woman. I'm not gonna take your male dominance bullshit!
Baumgartner sound Irish to you, fuck face?
And number three, Dolly.
And it's the same story over here. Why the crossover?  Theories.
I killed your fuckin' cat, you druggie bitch!
That's a possibility. Y'know you Boston cops are perking up. That's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men.  Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent.
Now stay with me, boys. What did they do to make two such identical wounds? Did one guy put him on his knees, pop a cap in, sit him back up and shoot him again the same way? No. Two men of similar height dropped this guy down, each put some iron to his head and boom! That's all she fuckin' wrote!
How many bodies, Greenly?
A couple of peons for the mob and...
Oh my god!
Oh, she's quite proud of herself.
Promise me boys.
You fuckin' guys. You ruined me. I'm fuckin' done. Permanent package boy.
Hurry the fuck up!
Those rat fucks! All of them were all laughing at me man!
Worst day of my life, man.
Hello? You there?
Why have you come to a church for council if you're not religious?
Has he now?
I want to stand for what I believe in, father.
Yes.
Father, I'll do you right here.
Just be natural, goddamit.
Well, it's the funny man. Give it here, package boy.
What does Starsky say?
Where are you going?
Did you see that?
I'm lookout.
It had an alarm.
Holy shit. What'd I tell you?
Dignan, calm down.
Yeah.
Why not?
See if mine are in there.
That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy me any $200 running shoes like yours. I wasn't spoiled.
Armored trucks are very difficult to steal, Anthony.
Dignan, I can't get my hair cut. That's just not possible, all right?
This is Inez. Carmen. Anita.
May I have a word with you, please?
Anthony, we're on the run from the law here. Did you tell these people your real name?
They don't?
But if it wasn't for Dignan I probably would of died.
I don't think we need any keys, Dignan. I think I can hotwire a car for us.
Yes, I do. Bob taught me.
Sixteen dollars.
You gave $383 to the goddamn housekeeper! What the fuck is your problem?
I want you to look at this.
No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.
Who did that? What the fuck is that?
Come on.
What?
Dignan, it's too late.
He did?
So how is it in there? 
When we go through the next gate you'll have 30 seconds to take out the tower guard.
You know, your form is for shit, but you've got a hell of a talent.
You mean like techniques?
I'd like to live in that place. Hinckley Cold Storage.
I guess what I'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan?
Sure, sure. He's a great person, and I'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. But I wonder if the kid has the goods  up here.
And you're wrong if you think, I'd turn my back on a friend.
Congratulations. You passed the test.
No, that door over there.
Exactly. Woah.
The fear of death, The pain of consciousness.  Did you mix this martini?
We're renegades from despair.
Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy.
Why don't you just tell them the truth. Those belong to my neighbor Phil.
Will you guys shut up? God. It's like having two little kids in the car.
You think he got my license plates?
How long are they going to hold him?
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
At first they were going to charge me with manslaughter. That's partly why I was in custody so long. Sixty days.
Were you adopted, Bob?
Well, because you guys don't look alike.
Was Future Man adopted?
Let's not even talk about it.
Yeah. Let's keep it --
You OK, Bob?
No, I know. I'm just saying. I feel fine. You want a piece of cake?
Were you born in Mexico?
Nice to meet you, Applejack.
Where'd they come from?
Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.
I don't know why the fuck we're having a party. The damn job's not over yet.
What?
No.
You stole a Trans-Am.
I think we might of scared her.
You know, Bob, Anthony did kill someone. He electrocuted our janitor senior year.
It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated.
What happened?
You really think he'll remember you?
Bob, will you please listen?
Bob. Are you coming?
The weed.
So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
Then how come they haven't set the bail yet? That's unconstitutional.
Future Man would never go to jail for you, I'll tell you that.
Dignan.
That's OK.
What's wrong with Applejack?
I said to the DA, That cop who hit me must of given me CRS disease.
Do they let you --
You keeping out of trouble?
How long do you have to go?
Ground defense.
Join the party, fellas.
Hello, my friend. You in the Army, yes?
You like Chicanos?
Guess I'll get another Tecate.
You told me Bourne was dead.
No. The files are spotless. Whatever they find, it's just going to make Conklin look worse.
He left yesterday on the night train. He's probably just getting in now.  You'll have to hurry.
Treadstone.
To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.
May I finish?
You don't know what you're getting into here.
Sit down.
Why not? It was just money.
You put a four-gam Kel on here and it's gonna take out power to the building. You know that. What you can't know, is if it's gonna blow the room with it.
There were two charges, they were supposed to go off simultaneously. The second one, the one that didn't go off, was down here...  First of all, this is nothing, it's a sub-line for the breaker above. Second, why put the charge all the way down here? If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear, you're good enough to know you don't need this.  Bourne would know.
Show me again...
Sit. Can you...  [The chair. Have the chair.]
That's not what happened to your parents.
You know I'm not.
I have to go now.
So why didn't you kill me then?
What do you want?
What's going on in Berlin?
She really did that? Told you not to kill me?  I had a woman once. But after a while, what do you talk about? I mean, for us. The work. You can't tell them who you are...
-- what? --
You are better. And I think it's not memories at all. It's just a dream you keep having over and over.
-- where's left to go? --
You keep going to the shack. I'll meet you there in an hour.
I love you, too.
I did.
You hear me? I believed you.
Why is she trying to kill me?
So when was I here?
Where am I?
Oh, shit...
Why am I alive?
Thank you for your gift. I'm sorry about Marie.
Don't need it. I remember everything.
You didn't answer my question.
-- so there were two of these explosive charges placed on the power lines. One of them failed. The fingerprint...  That's from the one that didn't go off.
It's a lot of money, Pam.
Okay, cut to the chase, Pam. What are you selling?
Good luck.
I'm curious about Bourne. Your interpretation of his condition. You have specific training in the identification and diagnosis of psychological conditions?
Is it fresh?
With cavalry -- not heavy, like the English, but light, fast horsemen, like you nobles employ -- we could outmaneuver their bowmen!
Young Robert, we are honored --
A wise plan. And how is your father? We have missed him at the council.
May he rest in peace... You have already sealed the coffin?
If I pay homage to another's throne, then how am I a king?
The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace.
He won't come.
So I did! And what was so important about it?
No, M'lord.
I'll wait... back there.
Thanks for the food and drink. And for bringing 'em yourselves.
They're English soldiers, ain't they?
Call it a test of soldiery, then. The English won't let us train with weapons, so we train with stones.
We must run in different directions!
Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king --
Thank you for accepting.
I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy.
But I won't give you up to any nobleman.
Tonight then.
Then when?
Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?
Why did you?
You have... you have a husband.
Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?
No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.
We can't stop!
What's the crazy man saying, Lord?
Anything.
If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.
Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.
Darn it!
No.
These'll bring you luck, Crockett.
Please, mom. People will talk.
Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?
Okay, doc. What's the damage? How much time have I got?
Just tell me if anything weird happens.
Are you hurting her?
This is where we're finding most of the hemorrhaging. The outer lining of the cerebral cortex.
You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.
Are you stupid or what?
Get out. Both of you.
I'm sorry Kayleigh. This was a bad idea.
Not since we were kids.
Actually, Kayleigh, the reason I came back to town was to talk to you.
Jesus, Kayleigh, you're...  Incredible.
I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.
So how's tricks? Sorry, occupational humor.
On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.
There's one major hole in your story.
Then you think it might have worked out?
Are you okay? You looked like you were somewhere else for a second there.
You can't play God, son. It must end with me. Just by being here, you may be killing your mother.
Whoa! Didn't mean to scare you, Evan. Just wanted to know how the flatworms project was coming.
Remember, everyone! Only two weeks until your science projects are due.
Most guys tuck their porn under here, but all you have are... comp books.
Freeze! No "worm-boy". No "Mr. Worm," and no "Worm-Master-General!" Once you get a nickname like that you can't shake it. And I don't want everyone thinking I've got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something, okay?
Uh, we should be getting to class now.
What the hell are you doing?
Listen to me good, Evan...
Mom. Don't cry. I can change this.
Nothing. Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that.
You put the mommy too far away. Mrs. Boswell has macaroni and glue if you wanna fix it.
Here you go, buddy.
The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure.
How long have you been married?
So you decided to go to America.
And he is still willing to give you a visa?
And you want to know --
Such a bargain. But that is your decision?
Mr. Berger, the ring, could I see it again?
I see.
Monsieur Rick, may I get you a cup of coffee?
Goodnight.
But Sacha always puts out that light --
I want you to take Miss Lund home.
Here you are.
Fine, but I would like to buy your cafe.
What do you want for Sam?
Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are.
Don't forget, you owe Rick's a hundred cartons of American cigarettes.
I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
Yes?
Why there is no other man in my life?
Strange. I know so very little about you.
That's too far ahead to plan.
I didn't count the days.
I don't know the finish yet.
Well, you can tell me now. I'm reasonably sober.
Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know.
Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?
How did you get in?
I told you this morning you'd come around, but this is a little ahead of schedule. Well, won't you sit down?
Oh, you'll help him now, Richard, won't you? You'll see that he gets out? Then he'll have his work, all that he's been living for.
I can't fight it anymore. I ran away from you once. I can't do it again. Oh, I don't know what's right any longer. You'll have to think for both of us, for all of us.
But why my name, Richard?
When will he be back?
This time they really mean to stop me.
Yes, I see. When I had trouble getting out of Lille, why didn't you leave me there? And when I was sick in Marseilles and held you up for two weeks and you were in danger every minute of the time, why didn't you leave me then?
He does. Could we have a table close to him?
Our faithful friend is still there.
Whatever I'd say, you'd carry on. Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?
Yes?
Yes, Victor, I was.
Are you ready Ilsa?
Rick? Who's he?
I hope we didn't overstay our welcome.
Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?
I brought the money, Monsieur Blaine.
Everything in order?
Monsieur Blaine, I don't ask you to explain anything.
My bill.
Well! A precedent is being broken. Er, Emil!
Ricky, you're becoming quite human. I suppose we have to thank you for that, Mademoiselle.
Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect's office.
That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.
With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
And the honor of having served the Third Reich.
Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power --
I've never accepted that privilege, and I'm now on French soil.
Very well, Herr Laszlo, we will not mince words. You are an escaped prisoner of the Reich. So far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us. You have reached Casablanca. It is my duty to see that you stay in Casablanca.
Is that all you wish to tell us?
Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.
What else, my dear Major?
Thank you. It is a pleasure to have you here, Major.
May I recommend Veuve Cliquot '26, a good French wine.
Rick is completely neutral about everything. And that takes in the field of women, too.
As to Laszlo, we want him watched twenty-four hours a day.
You see, Captain, the situation is not as much under control as you believe.
You see what I mean? If Laszlo's presence in a cafe can inspire this unfortunate demonstration, what more will his presence in Casablanca bring on? I advise that this place be shut up at once.
My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.
If you are thinking of warning him, don't put yourself out. He cannot possibly escape.
I see. And what's Strasser doing here? He certainly didn't come all the way to Casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency.
Rick, that is the first time I have ever seen you so impressed.
Well, you were asking about Rick and here he is. Mademoiselle, may I present --
Well, Ricky. I'm very pleased with you. Now you're beginning to live like a Frenchman.
Why do you interfere with my little romances?
How can you close me up? On what grounds?
But you haven't any actual proof, and you know it. This isn't Germany or occupied France. All you can do is fine him a few thousand francs and give him thirty days. You might as well let him go now.
And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.
Sam's piano.
-- Not so fast, Louis. Nobody's going to be arrested. Not for a while yet.
I have. Sit down over there.
I suppose you know what you're doing, but I wonder if you realize what this means?
Give me another.
Are my eyes really brown?
Hello?
Huh. You know, Rick, watching you just now with the Deutsches Bank, one would think you'd been doing this all your life.
Thank you.  Will you have a drink with me please?
Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him at the Blue Parrot.
Ain't you planning on going to bed in the near future?
Please, boss, let's go. Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.
We'll take the car and drive all night. We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing and stay away until she's gone.
Shit!  Shit!  Shit!
Can't.  Need water.
If they can't see you, what's the point?
You're putting off the inevitable.
Get water!
I'm lost.  Goodbye.
Look, just slip off the raft.  The ocean would feel so good, the water's so soft and warm.  Take a little swim.  Sleep.
You know, Wilson, every now and then we should say thank you.  Thank you God.
They're never going to see you.  You're just another piece of trash in the ocean.
I float.  You sink.  End of story.
It's real.
You can't make it.
Well, I have to say, I'm impressed.  You never gave up.
You know what happened to this?
You?  Personally?
Don't overwhelm me with details, you know how I hate that.  Did you get it fixed?
Merry Christmas eve.
Four four.  A record.
You know, for when you travel.
Why didn't you come over, get mad at me, tell me what a stupid bitch I was.
Chuck, you're breaking my heart.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
That about sums it up.
The tide came in, the tide went out.  I survived.  That's the headline.  I survived.
So simple to say, so hard to do.
This is so unfair.
I am one lucky guy.
If you say you are.
Doc, I'm not on the island.  I'm not on the raft.  I'm alive.  I'm so glad to be back, I can't tell you.  I just want out of here.
Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive, from thou bounty, through Christ the Lord.  Amen.
The place is falling apart.
Doing great, Mom, don't worry about me.
What a journey you've had.  It seems more than a person should have to bear.
Trying.
Okay.  After three years the PTR reverts to tape storage, which is okay because we access it through the CPC.  Here it is.  Ten packages from the same sender.  Baku. Delhi.  St. Petersburg.  The guy was a real road warrior.  This package was Kuala Lampur.  No activity in his account after this package.  No forwarding addresses after K.L.
What do you expect, from the guy who stole a kid's bicycle when his truck broke down?
And never take.
You are one sick fucker.
A hundred rubles St. Petersburg hits 95 percent in a month.
Must have taken a hell of a long time.
I'm serious.  The burning bush, the big picture, the words in neon...
Permission to come aboard, sir.
May I ask, where are you bound?
It's not ergot, it's not pituitary extract, it's not oil of rue...
He *sniffs* that ether! I've seen him do it!
He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!
And that I can drive a truck!
Homer, you know I would never kill anyone--you know I wouldn't.
What'd she die of?
Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him?
Daddy, it's a letter to *me*.
So. Not bored yet?
I better go.
A movie *outside*?
You're a natural. You were born to drive a car like this.
At least you were never lonely.
Aren't you worried that people will cut their feet?
I *know* this was right.
Olive told me.  You might have told me yourself.
No! That's not all there is to it! I love you, too--I *know* I do.
Isn't that like waiting and seeing?
If you're trying to be funny, Homer...
I *helped* you not to think about Wally. You were so upset--you couldn't stand worrying about him, about his being killed and not coming back-- but when you were with me, you could stop worrying... well, for a while, anyway. This is how I helped you, right?
And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you...
No, I'm the one who should be sorry. You have every right to be angry.
You ain't been through what I been through, Candy.
I know where you can go. Homer and I can take you...
There! You said it was boring.
I love you, Wally.
Nobody special enough, Curly.
I don't know! He's just leaving--  you're the one who says he needs to see the world!  *That's* what he'll do--he'll see the world!
"Homer Wells, born Portland, Maine, March 2, 1915..."
You mean they'll replace you with someone who won't perform abortions.
Or that he can't be bothered to write us a proper letter? A dissertation on apples, we don't need!
Is *your* father dead?
But did you know him?
What's a nanny do?
Don't get too excited, Fuzzy.
So, now, uh... you're not... I mean, do *you* do the--
They wouldn't take me. I'm Class IV-- I've got a heart defect.
No, I'm not. I need a job.
What lousy luck--I mean your orders... to draw an assignment like that!
Stop it, Homer. They aren't our rules. We didn't write them. I don't see no reason to read them.
That's better. I can tell you got yourself some education. Them's good hands you got, Homer. Them hands you got, they know what they're doin'-- ain't that right?
But she's your *daughter*...
What's that? What's it called?
Merthiolate, ether, vulval pads, gauze--lots of gauze.
If that was your knife, Muddy, I wanna thank you for givin' it to her-- no girl should be goin' *hitch-hikin'* if she don't got a good knife with her.
You know *how* to help these women-- how can you not feel *obligated* to help them when they can't get help anywhere else?
It's obviously an aborticide.
I don't think so.
I thought you took care of this. It always breaks in the same place. It's your splice, isn't it?
I thought it was my turn.
What I mean is... I would like it very much if you thought you could be happy here, Homer.
"One: Please don't smoke in bed."
There's a little something wrong with it. Just this part here--the right ventricle. It's slightly enlarged.
You ain't gettin' in no trouble, I hope.
That's *it*?
That just ain't right, Jack--your cigarette's gonna end up in nine or ten gallons of this batch of cider! That ain't right.
You can't think that a man who has *served* under such conditions as exist over there will be in the slightest daunted by a little *snow*-- have you no idea how harsh and primitive and full of *disease* that part of the world is?
They told me I was too old to serve.
You pickin' nothin' but cider apples, Peaches--I hope you understand that.
That sounds like you is in trouble already, Homer.
Now, now, Jack--that just ain't right.
Where do you think you're going?
You just go inside, Homer. We don't need no help.
Rose Rose has runned away!
You ever see a palm tree, Homer?
My name's Grant. Grant Ashby.
What do you do over at your bank, Grant?
Let's just slow down for a second...
Then there it is. Ashby gets the itch.
Same thing with playing a con. You have to be able to see that deep.
It's all about the money, isn't it?
Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.
We were back on.
Currently, the King Pin is a very large-type pole stuck up our asses.
Moonan. Here. Shit...
It can buy you a new and better you.
When?
You gotta be kidding me. Her?
She up for this?
Uh... No thanks. I'm not going all the way to Brooklyn for a hundred dollar pay-off.
You ever use the bathroom in Kennedy?
I' ll be honest with you, Kid. A grifter comes in here with a fifteen hundred dollar D-K-fucking-N-Y suit, cooler than an Eskimo in winter and tells me he wants to grift for me? First thing I have to ask myself is, is he playing for me or is he just plain playing me? You tried it once.
Come here. Feel this.
What are you talking about? Ten's standard.
Oh yeah. Moonan. I remember now. Thanks.
Sorry, I --
What -- What do we do?
What do I have to do?
What about Customs?
You need to get a haircut.
We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can.
I gotta go get a haircut.
You told me to change my hair!
Look at you... You want to go.
I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush.
So that was my part? Smile and shake my ass?
Not the way I did it. I was loaded half the time. I don't know how you could change bedpans sober. I used to hang out with this guy, Glenn. He was an x-ray technician or something.
We were friends. I trusted him. I should have known it was weird. But, then again I was weird.
Shit, what was that guy's name? I really liked him.
I was supposed to meet him for breakfast. He likes that new IHOP they just opened, you know... He likes to order that thing. The Rutti- Tutti-Fresh and Fruity thing they got.
We're working for the King.
Uh...
I'm just thinking out loud here, but... Two million in a briefcase?
I know it's policy, but...  The thing is... It's our first anniversary and we're only in town for the weekend. It's a very, very special night for my wife and I. This ring is my gift to her and I think she's going to really love it. I can give you phone numbers to call for people who'll vouch. I can send you I.D. later...
So that's it, huh? You get the cops to give you a safe ride.
Stand up.
Sorry. What?
Aces, Suits.
The King? Jake, you play the heavy rackets like that... They put the lug on for nothing at all.
So do half the other people in this place. How do I know which one?
Like we told you before, we think he's into something with the King Pin --
Peace of mind.
You sell it.
It's just insurance.
What are you doing?
Hi, Jack.  Welcome to the cesspit.
Jack. Do you need a ride?
I hate cheats.
The Indian rope-trick.
Reynolds got a doctor in. They forced me to take a dope test. It was positive. As you knew.
How about fifteen hundred?
What?!
Hi-ya... I'll call you back.  Now then...
I thought it was you. It's the hair!
Good night?
No, no. I'm not ready for you. There's some vodka in the freezer.
Where did you get it?
Take it back. Till you sell your book.
It came my way. 450 a week.
Where've you been? I've got to give evidence in court at nine.
This fucking job's getting to you. You haven't written a fucking word since you started.
You're my conscience.
It's beautiful. Thank you.
Really?
How did you know I was here?
I'm sorry, madam, we don't accept gratuities in the UK. It's different in South Africa.
I've lived there.
To coincidence.
I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar.
You don't have to be criminal. A man will come up to your table and deliberately cheat. You'll see him, stop him, and the guy will make a big scene. There'll be chaos. And that's when it'll happen.
These people will pay you ten thousand before and ten thousand after. They want someone they can be sure of, an honest dealer. That's the point. Not all dealers are honest. Mr Reynolds will never suspect you.
It doesn't seem fair. You're offering me ten grand in cash but you can't afford a decent place.
I don't think we should meet again.
How are you?
Detective Inspector Ross.
Of course I recognised him!
I'm a witch. A white witch. Why don't we move on?
Nice car. How much did you pay for it?
Where do you live, Jack?
I'm going over the river. I'll give you a lift if you like.
What are you, a cop?
Does Bella come here?
I'm off. I need to sleep.
I can't give you a lift back tonight.
Where did you go to school?
I make it six.
Next point. Friendships between croupiers inside or outside the casino are discouraged. Relationships with females working here are expressly forbidden.
We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished.
Thanks for the information.
I have a reduced drive reading of seven thousand.
I'm not sure. I think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship, though.
Where's the fail-safe key?
Where is it? What did you do with it?
The key, goddamit, the key!
Where is the key?
It didn't go off.
We've got to disarm the bomb.
Pinback, I have a computer reading of nine five seven seven.
Well... now what? What do, you have for us now. Boiler?
Find me something, I don't care where it is.
Fuck that shit.
Swell. Let's synchronize detonation time. Do you know when you're supposed to go off?
Fail safe in lock. Four minutes to drop, 22 minutes to detonation. This is Sergeant Pinback calling Bomb #20. Do you read me, bomb?
Therefore, I shall ignore you.
Snap out of it, bomb.
This is Lieutenant Doolittle calling Bomb #20. I repeat previous order, you are to disarm yourself and return immediately to the bomb bay. Do you understand?
Bomb, this is Doolittle. You are not to detonate, repeat, you are not to detonate in the bomb bay. Disarm yourself. This is an order.
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
Well of course I exist.
My sensory apparatus reveals it to me.
This is fun.
Now, bomb, consider this next question, very carefully. What is your one purpose in life?
And you can only do it once, right?
That's all beside the point. The concepts are valid, wherever they originate.
So if you detonate in...
...you may be doing so on the basis of false data.
I need a GHF reading on the gravity correction.
Your GHF reading is minus fifteen.
I'm coming in now. I'm down by the Emergency Air Lock. Too much trouble to come in the Ventral Lock. Would you blow the seal on the emergency hatch so I can come in?
I need a diameter approximation.
You know, Talby, you really ought to eat with the rest of us. You spend too much time up here.
...Should spend some time below, see more of the rest of the ship...
I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, I think about back home, back home at Malibu. I used to surf a lot, Talby. I used to be a great surfer.
Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle? Sir?
Oh yeah?
It is, Doolittle, it's the Phoenix! They glow with all the colors of the rainbow, just like everybody said.
Commander Powell, this is Doolittle. Ah, there's something serious come up, sir, and I have to ask you something.
Sir?
Oh, yeah?
Mr. Sonrisa saw you on the cameras.  He wants you to come see him.
Or we can work on your face with a pair of pliers for a couple of hours and you tell us where she is.
What?
This is what your life's worth, Bruno.
'Cause you went out the back door and nailed her girlfriend?  Who would take offense to that?
Lemme put some clothes on.
Out there.
But I'm afraid of--
What're you looking for?
Which means I gotta fence it for two. Who's got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the times.
I'll give you seventy-five bucks for it.
I'll make it worth your while.
You're light a deuce.
I made you coffee.  That oughta help you cope with the injustice of the world a little.
He's a mistake I made about six months before you did.  But don't feel bad. Justine made the same mistake, along with Renee, Jada, Tia, Brooke--
What's with you?  Every week this scumbag puts the squeeze on us and every week you roll out the welcome wagon like he's family.
Your daughter's the only leverage they have to keep you quiet.
Look, we gotta keep the momentum up here, not give her a chance to think.  If she hears her kid's voice...
What makes you cry?
Don't worry, I'm coming to get you.
Thank God.
So this guy walks into a bar and says...
Am I s'posed to be grateful?
Suppose I could help you locate the other ones.
I know they made me.  Even got the label on my neck to prove it.
Christmas is a snap when you got no parents or relatives, just a bunch of gene sequences from probably twenty different people.
It turned up on the black market.  One of my sources thought I might be interested.
Maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe, sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation.  But the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden.  Wasn't s'posed to, but it did.  And it's back to the law of the jungle.  You got your predators and you got your victims.
I'm looking for a lady who works here.
But she does work here?
What do you want?
Who's this guy?  This isn't who we're looking for...her name was Hannah.
What about the other kids?  You get anything on them?
I'm sorry I couldn't come up with something more positive.
Zero... C'mon, Dan I don't have all day.
Just give it to me.  I'll remember.
A long time.
Because you're probably my closest friend in the whole world.
Friends don't help other friends cheat.
So are dogs.
Right after you change your wardrobe, your personality and drop about thirty pounds.
Look, you're a player... I'm bringing you this on a plate, and my fee is just the normal cost of doing business.
She's got my word.
Here's the dealio on Eyes Only.  He's probably some wack rich dude sitting around in a trick-ass apartment, bored stupid.  So he gets off on scarin' the poop outta folks like you-- I gotta go.
Or do you think we're just so grateful to have one of you idiots we'll look the other way, which is arrogant and condescending.
And you were a sympathetic ear.
Then a sympathetic mouth, then a sympathetic--
And Lydia telling Natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way?
Fight fire with fire.  Threaten to go to her husband.
So you're straight on how this is gonna go down.
She tells you how I've been--
No, I'm serious.  That psycho got exactly what she deserved... Yes.
She's toxic...monster in bed, but toxic.
This is a hot run.  Beat it.  You're late.
What about this?
Hot run to 842 Beulah, corner of Haight... And you can tell your pal Theo he just got his worthless ass fired. Not that he cares but the wife and kid might.
Well. Obviously no one you have to worry about... Woody.
No, I mean... you love your son?
You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?
Sure, I have. But not one with ice in it, that's all.
Whoa... she is a killer.
I-I c-can't...
Sorry.
Your man is the drummer, Peter Criss, right?
Oh, God, how calculating of me to lead you all on like that after you offered me a ride in the middle of nowhere.
This is the best thing that ever happened to me at school! Not only are we on again for KISS in Detroit, but we're actually sitting right at the fifty yard line! I dare you dudes to find a curlier scenario.
I'm starvin' and it's way past lunchtime.
Let's stop in Sandusky, Hawk.
That's Sherry VanHafton.
Whoa... she just farted.
Sunday, but...
What the fuck!
Cool, bro, now listen up...
I think we should try sneaking in.
Could be.
Are you gettin' wise with me?
Well, let's recap, shall we? You slapped all of us, yelled at me, used my head for a rag, threw me on the ground and tossed our LOVE GUN 8- track under the wheels of a passing semi.  So, if the lesson was that you're a dick with ears and a really bad haircut, then, yes... I'd say we learned it.
Well... I still got my idea if anybody will let me speak.
Oh, hi, mom.
Jeremiah, what are you doing?
Mom, what're we...?
Jeremiah... what's gotten into you?
No.
Okay, you better have something really sinful for me this time, son. My patience is worn to threads and your mom will be here any minute.
Jam has yet to do an overnight with us.
Simplicity, Hawk.
About fuckin' time if you ask me. I'm just going through the motions till I drop out anyway.
Hey, kid, that's okay. I don't wanna see KISS that ba...
Look, you can have my wallet...
Oh, yeah! You and what army?
Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!
I did?
Now that's better... but I still sense some students out there... who are AFRAID... just to say GOOD MORNING!
Are you AFRAID?
That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it.
Who is... we?
I want to show you something.
Hey...
Oh, I... have those too.  What kind of problems does your dad have?
Wow. Did he go to jail?
Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.
It's like this big force... that's in your brain. But sometimes it grows bigger... and it spread down into your arms and legs... and it just sends you someplace.
That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.
You want to skip fourth period and go to the Ridge?
My mom is gone.
What?
Come with me.
Time is running out. We have to go see Grandma Death. We have to talk to her.
Well, life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love.
You're such a fuck-ass.
Oh, please tell me, Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck?
Grandma Death.
I have to take the girls to Los Angeles tomorrow.
Good Lord.  So the construction guys say it'll take about a week to fix the roof. Damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match.
No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned.  But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.
Who's been giving you weird looks?
Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.
Is the death of one species less tragic than another?
What's "Cellar Door"?
Cellar door.
So... will Donnie find his Cellar Door?
So, I met a new friend.
His name is Frank.
I think he saved my life.
Follow him where?
Who is the boss?
Can anyone else see him?
And they grow out of our stomachs?
Regret.
That I did it again.
Because I'm so horny.
He's right there... He can read my mind and he'll show me the way out of this. The sky is going to open up... and then He will reveal himself to me.
It's too late. I've already ruined my life.
Your medication. They're placebos. Just pills made out of water.
Whoa, Elizabeth. A little hostile, there. Maybe you should be the one in therapy. Then Mom and Dad can pay someone two hundred dollars an hour to listen to all of your thoughts... so we won't have to.
It's not that. I mean mouthing off to your teachers. I'll admit... when Dad told me what you said to Ms. Farmer, I laughed my ass off.
Mom and Dad won't be back until Sunday night. It's Halloween Carnival. We should throw a party. We could totally get away with it.
Gerald.
Thank you for seeing us... We... just felt that it was time to discuss...
Has your son ever told you about Frank?
Here are the keys to the Taurus. There's plenty of groceries in the fridge. And I left money on the kitchen table. And don't forget...
Christ. Is that an axe?
Excuse me... but what is the real issue here? The PTA doesn't ban books from school.
Rose.
Rose, we have a crisis.  I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham.
Please! Don't say those words.  Well... as you can see... many of us are devastated by this news. This is obviously some kind of conspiracy meant to destroy an innocent man. And I have taken it upon myself to spearhead the Jim Cunningham defence campaign. But unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest... which involves you.
Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know, the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now, as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip.
Kitty, I would appreciate... if you could wait...
Kitty...
"Once a carnie, always a carnie."
What is wrong with you?
I never liked her, but she didn't deserve to die in the belly of a swan like that. The whole thing's just kinda sad and lame at the same time.
I gotta work with these women.
I just, I just can't believe it. I'm Minnesota's American Teen Princess!
Oh, Amber...
Oh c'mon, I love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause Peter needed a kidney.
Okay. Yesterday I... I got this picture. So I kinda, y'know, I'm thinkin' no. I'm gonna, I -- I -- I'm gonna quit the pageant.
God I hope that's you and not your concussion talkin'.
I hate her!
What're you doin' here?
What?
Here, I didn't get any.
So, anyone talk to Janelle?
I know it doesn't matter, but on my inner thighs.
What do you mean, they take out her butt?
She's the prettiest, y'know. The best damn tapper. The most smartest...
They're makin' a movie, here, goddamn it.
C'mon, Rebecca, you wanted it. Now get up there. Ride it side-saddle if you have to -- like a horse. C'mon, now.
Dakota.
That bitch from...
Wisconsin.
...Oh, yeah-right. I ain't gonna be in no goddamn pageant! Look what happened to that dork-ass farm girl.
What a surprise. Gladys Leeman's finally gonna go to State. And she'll probably ride on Becky's ass all the way to Nationals, too.
Hey, Ted, sorry. I didn't know your family was in the garage when I set it on fire!
Iris, stop!  It's not his fault. The communal wine just proves too temptin' for some of them.
You know that sometimes it's hard to understand God's great plan.
So, remember the three most important parts of a good interview...
I will if you shut your piehole.
EE-AAAYEEEE-AAAAYOUIAAAEEEEEEEE!
Excuse me, Father, Mother, when are we moving back to Tokyo? I can't stand this place anymore. They put butter on everything.
I'm sorry, Dad, but with all due respect, my name isn't "Tina," it's Seiko.
Oh, I almost forgot...  I got my acceptance to Tokyo University.
That doesn't sound right...  take out "President"...  now read it.
In her dressing room?  Why, what could he be doing there?
You haven't been still a moment since you've been here.  You act as if you had neurosis --
Well - what is he now?
What do you whistle?
'At's-a no good.  I went to Niagara Falls once.
No, but I shot some ducks.
I don't wanna work at all.
Look, I'm a very nervous man.  I gotta have a job where I come to work at eleven -- go to lunch at twelve -- and quit at one.  And twice a year I gotta have a six month vacation.
Send in the next girl. 
I'm glad I didn't ask you for "Washington Crossing the Delaware".
Late again, eh?  You haven't been on time once since this war started...  Get out there and fight... 
That's not fair -- we've only got fifty thousand.
That's the spirit -- fifty-fifty.
Anything else? 
Chicolini, you've come just in time. We need a man who's fearless, brave. A man who's willing to die, if necessary.
It must be done right away.
We're not allowed to tell a dirty joke HAIL, HAIL, FREEDONIA
If we should choose to chew, we'll be pursued -
I'll keep the greetings -- but you can send back the good will... what we need right now is twenty million dollars.
When you get through with her feet, you can start on mine.  I haven't been to a chiropodist in two years...  If that's not an insult, I don't know what is.  Gloria, I love you.  I --
Give me that again!
Then it's war?
What I called you...  Why, what did I call you?
Your Excellency!
So -- you've come to ask for clemency! I'll give the enemy no quarter -- not a dime...
I hope I'm not interrupting.
I -- I may be wrong, but I suspect the Secretary of War.
I shall report this indignity the my President.  Mrs. Teasdale,  I feel this regrettable occurrence will plunge our countries into war.
Uncle, you can't do this!
This is all Firefly's fault -- that idiot, that fool...
If only we can get his Excellency to listen to reason...
They have noble faces.
Oh... why Mr. Merrick she's beautiful.
You won't be long?
Did it go well, darling?
What do you mean?
But I thought you said that he was rather... simple?
...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening.
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
I found it.
Like this. 
What are you going to do?
Don't!
What happened?
He's a clumsy git. Never watches where he is going.
Pull the other one, why don't you! We made a deal!
You think you're better 'n me? YOU wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you guv. So I gave him to you. On trust, in the name of science! And now I want him back.
I want him back!
Good morning, Treves.
What are your plans then, Treves... You are aware that the London does not accept incurables. The rules are quite clear on that point.
Good! How is the patient?
No, Treves, it's out of the question. Now if it was up to me, I'd say "Certainly, let's meet the fellow, by all means," I'm sorry, I simply can't speak for the other members of the committee.
...As I said, it's only a physical problem... but I do feel that Mr. Merrick is very flattered that you're taking the time and trouble to meet him, and he's most anxious to make a good impression, so he might seem rather nervous.
It was a great pleasure to meet you, Mr. Merrick.
What say you, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?
Mr. Treves says that you are in the theatre. Do you live there?
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
John, I'd like you to meet one of the brightest lights of the British stage, Mrs. Kendal. Mrs. Kendal, John Merrick.
Well it is a miracle he ever got back. And, I'm sure, Mr. Treves, under your expert care, he'll have many happy years ahead.
The... oh, the spire! How silly of me, it's as plain as day... Mr. Merrick, where did you learn to do this?
Yyyy... Yyye... yyyess.
...Yyes
Hello...
John... Merrick
Righteousness for his namesake.
Mr. Merrick likes the food here. Don't you John?
The hospital?
I love the way you've arranged your pictures on the mantlepiece. Is that the way it's done in most houses?
...my... home?
Will the cathedral be finished soon, John?
Yes John?
Goodnight John. Sleep well.
Very smart indeed.
Well...
So you see, John, there's no need for a lighthouse. All your friends are here.
Don't lie to me. I know all about it. You were SEEN. Where did you take him?
HE'S GONE!
Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.
So you'll bring him to me, tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.? Mr...?
There is no magic, Father... My mother had no magic...
It's all right! It isn't happening!
What was she like?
But you LOVED her all the same...
I've never LOVED anybody!
Halfdan the Black.
Where's the Cloak Invisible?
Erik! You've done what you came to do!
I don't want to live WITHOUT you.
But... How is it you can see me?  You can all see me?
Now what CAN you want with me, Erik the "Viking"?
But have you ever seen it? Think back...
And will the dead ever return, Freya?
No. 
We're just not a very musical nation...
Is there something the matter with it?
Of course I like women... I LOVE 'em.
I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
Thanks for saving me from a fate worse than death.
"But" what?
Let's hack her to pieces.
Halfdan the Black's here!
But. You're not even afraid of DEATH, Thorfinn!
It's always the women that start the trouble.
I... I... KILLED her...
Thank you VERY much indeed.
It's SO nice to feel wanted.
That's better.
Row!
Weren't we supposed to?
There is another way.
Wait, Erik!
Bjorn's not. He could have Bjorn's place.
Nobody's ever crossed the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard.
Yes it does! We could be at sea for months.
Bye, Leif.
What's all the panic about?
How did he do that?
You coming? You don't even believe in Asgaard.
He used to puke in his sleep.
And a sort of slightly sick feeling?
For your own sake... For the others... I...
Well! Come on!
Who's that?
Together we stand!
Urrgh! Argh! Let go, you idiot!
It's a tradition.
You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.
And don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you.
But I thought, I don't know, I thought it was cool that you were sensitive enough to know what I was feeling and that you were attracted to it.
The weirder part is I think actually I recognize you. I thought that earlier in the diner. That's why I was looking at you. You work at Borders, right?
I like it.
I can't remember.
You sure? That doesn't sound --
Huckleberry Hound?
Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just...  Take care, then.
Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no.
Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.
Thanks very much. That was very nice of you.
Thanks.
I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic -- night picnics are different -- and --
So, I enjoyed meeting you.
Let me drive you home.
How can you watch this crap?
I don't think we're ready.
More?
Joely...
Such a beautiful view.
You remember what happened next?
Do you remember what we talked about?
Yeah.
I'm sure, I said.
I told her today I need to end it.
I didn't think you'd show your face around me again. I figured you were humiliated. You did run away, after all.
Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me.
I'm Clementine. Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?
You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance.
Bye, Joel.
So you'll call me, right?
Don't worry. It's really solid this time of year.
-- and I'm just too nervous around you right now.
Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man.  Says you were jealous and suspicious.
Ha Ha! You said, I do. I guess that means we're married.
Maybe it's true then. It's my voice on the tape.
It's true.
Look, I have to go. I have to think.
You must have been crazy.
That's me.
I might be making a mistake.
Clementine.
She's so sexy.
We'll start with your most recent memories and go backwards -- There is an emotional core to each of our memories -- As we eradicate this core, it starts its degradation process -- By the time you wake up in the morning, all memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared. Like a dream upon waking.
I'm sorry you saw one of our notification cards. You never should have.
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about --
Naomi, I really value our relationship. I hope it's possible for us to stay in touch.
Hey, if you're ordering lunch for Mierzwiak, would you --
Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate.
Let him go, Stan. I can help.
It's amazing, isn't it? Such a gift Howard gave the world.
To let people begin again. It's beautiful. You look at a baby and it's so fresh, so clean, so free. And adults... they're like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness... hopelessness. And Howard just makes it go away.
Oh.
Mary...
Order me a pastrami for after?
Do you like quotes, Howard?
Yes, shit. Oops, sorry!  Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.
That's lovely.
Stan? What's going on?
Jesus. All right, what's the address.
You get some sleep, Howard. I'll take it from here.
She should not have done this, Stan. As mad as she was... as justifiably --
This book -- It's essential that people read it because --  -- It's the truth. And only I know it.
Yeah?
I like Mary. I like when she comes to visit. I just don't think she likes me.
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
Mary hates me. I've never been popular with the ladies.
Oh? Well, there's been some trouble on the ranch. I came up here to get out of the way. It's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down. If you could help...
During the Second World War I busted out of Tule Lake detention camp; as a Japanese-American, I had been put there and watched over. I found refuge with the Clock People, who discovered me in a snow bank, near dead, I had been climbing across the Sierra Nevada mountains.
But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte.
A traveler, eh?
Where are the others?
No, I'm afraid that part isn't true. Jack was in awe of me and tracked me down. We spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field, but he was hardly my lover. Besides, I always travel alone.
Shit O dear, Julian. Do you mean to tell me you didn't get it on?
What do they do to you boys in those Ivy league schools, anyway? Strap you down and pump the Nature out of you? They can even press the last drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck. Why, send a shaman or cannibal to Yale for four years and all he'd be fit for would be a desk in the military-industrial complex and a seat in the third row at a Neil Simon comedy. Jesus H.M.S. Christ! If Harvard or Princeton could get hold of the Chink for a couple of semesters they'd turn him into a candidate for the Bow Tie Wing of the Hall of Wimps. Oogie boogie.
But I don't want you to leave. Please stay. We can go to dinner. I owe you a dinner. And tonight... we can... really make love.
Why? Why do you have to go?
So now you're bummin' around?
You're the best?
Whooee!
To my own special Sissy. Cheers! And welcome. So my letter brought ya flying, eh? Where were you? Salt Lake City? La Conner? Well, I may have a little surprise for you. But first, tell me about yourself. It's been six months, hasn't it? In some circles that's half a year. How are you?
That's the very first time in the eons that I've known you that I've ever heard you complain. And now you're tired, poor darling.
Freak, schmeek. Most of us are freaks in one way or another. Try being born a male Russian countess into a white middle class Baptist family in Mississippi and you'll see what I mean.
She's a young thing who works on my ranch. Real name is Sally Jones or something wooden like that. She's cute as a hot fudge taco, and, of course, it takes verve to change one's name so charmingly. But she stinks like a slut just the same.
Sissy, Sissy, blushing bride, you can desist from wearing paths in those forgotten highways. The Countess has arranged a job for you. And what a job...
The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters, burns and rashes. Although the FDA judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market, they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings.
I can't be certain that you would. But what have you got to lose?
Ballast.
...cancel our leave and send us out on some bullshit mission...!
From what?
...and the gravity drive goes where no man has gone before.
We'll have to re-route through the port conduit to the APU.
It's holding... She's holding...!
Damn, Dr. Weir, don't scare us like that. Coffee?
I'm gonna activate the emergency beacon.
We haven't tested the air yet. It could be contaminated...
To conserve our oxygen, we should severely restrict our activity. Anyone who can should get some sleep.
Of course not. Justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it. Just one of those things.  I swore I'd never lose another man. I came close today. Real close.
Please...
I've got a pulse, he's alive...
90 over 50 and falling... .
Intubate, pure oxygen feed, get the nitrogen out of his blood...
It's not that simple.  Lyle, play the recording for Dr. Weir.
The official inquiry blamed Weir's design for the ship's loss.
He doesn't belong on this mission. Responsible or not, he blames himself. He's too close to it.  And then there's his wife.
What does?
Okay. We do it the hard way. Deck by deck, room by room. Starck, deploy the umbilicus. I believe you're up for a walk, Mr. Justin. Go get your bonnet on.
Justin, finish your sweep.
I can understand your desire to redeem your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it doesn't factor into this.
Peters is right, no one's here.
That's the engineering containment. And there's the main airlock. We can dock there.
Any survivors?
Yes.
It's insane.
We barely have enough power for life support as it is, if we can't stop the drain, we're not gonna make it.
You said this ship creates a gateway...
We're leaving.
You... You can't do that!
What are you?
You want me to believe you're the Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit!
Then what, what are you? Tell me...
I don't like it either, but you know the rules: we get the call, we go. Is the course locked in?
We're all on edge, Smith. We're a long way out...
Captain Miller...
Thank you.
Crossing the horizon. Optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees.
Something's wrong with the bio-scan.
The antennae array's completely fried, we've got no radio, no laser, no highgain... No one's going to be coming to help us.
Oxygen is not the problem.
It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot.
What's the point? I'll just get the same thing...
You've got to listen...
I didn't say that, I said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us...
It's not bullshit, it's the only conclusion the data supports...
I'm on my way, Starck.
I'll do it --
About an hour ago. In medical. I saw my son. He was lying on one of the examination tables and his legs were... 
You got any coffee?
Hey...
What?
You can't do that.
This is U.S. Aerospace Command vessel Lewis and Clark, hailing Event Horizon, Event Horizon, do you read...? This is the Lewis and Clark, hailing... 
If they are, they're screening their calls.
You don't know what it's like out there. Walking around like some kind of circus freak. People staring, whispering --
We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
Ben?
Oh my G-g-g. What did you... do to Ben?
He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
What about his first born?
They crashed it into a wall. A flight simulator.
What? Come on. She's got a good thing with Victor --
He's smart, powerful, successful --
What the --!
It's about to be a broken face.
We're working as hard as we can --
Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work.
What the hell you smiling at? Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --
Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --
What?
And where do we think we're going?
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
Me like-y.
We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...
Not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it.
What is that thing?
You're really cramping my style here.
Is that what you call it? "Real"?
Johnny, slow down. Think. You know mom didn't raise us to --
Reed's disaster. You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
Sir, I've always wondered... Why Sue? You could have any woman in the world but --
Well, uh, based on our history... you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics. Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--
What?
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
It's not "invisibility" per se. You're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field. That's what you projected on the Bridge.
You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --
Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
I mean, you broke up with me, right?
You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you... speak his mind. One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
Got it. So take a walk, Ben... I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
We've got minutes until it hits, not hours... Victor, that storm's deadly -- the radiation's lethal. We need to abort.
Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes. Why?
What are you doing here?
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
Victor, wait, slow down a second. I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
He's working round the clock. But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us worse, maybe even kill us.
Something happened to them, mon.
Well, I believe you have to fill out a form. There's a pad right around here.
I take out the garbage.
Brad, what would you say if I asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them at work?
Is everything okay at work?
You are a virgin!
You're not going to tell me, are you?
Those were perfectly good fries, Hamilton.  Perfectly good.
Leave me alone!
Are you really a virgin?
I want you to know that it's your final decision if we should continue or not.
What's going on?
How do you know it's mine? We only did it once.
There's only one thing we can do. We've got to get rid of it. We've got to get an abortion.
Yeah. My brother Art got his girlfriend one once.
Doesn't sound free to me.  So you want me to pay for it?
It's definitely your mama.
Did you get her name?
I would. Yeah.
That's the idea, Rat. That's The Attitude.
The business is changing, Rat. I'll tell you, these kids today... they don't even listen to Aerosmith.
Knock it off, Damone. I need real help.
Did you go home and get it?
I come for the seafood. It's great! Hey... you know what, Mark? I found your wallet the other day. You want it back?
Poor guy.
Jesus. I'm sorry.
You're losing it, Damone.
Sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking.
Lust For Life. It's the story of Vincent Van Gough.
All right, what you want to do is go to the Free Clinic and tell the doctor that you have sex regularly -- several times a week -- and that you need Nornel One Plus Fifty's.
Are you going to ride that wave?
Seen the new Playboy?
Come on, Linda, I haven't had a boyfriend all summer. You promised when I started working at the mall that my life would change... Do you think he'll call this week?
Face it. With some guys you have to make the first move. A lot of guys are just... wussies.
No there are variables that, like, I might not be good at.
Just kidding. About 10cc.
So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious?
I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
Does that ever happen?
How long does Doug take?
What's Doug do in Chicago?
God, he hardly even talks anymore.
You have been acting very strange the last few weeks.
What do you think it is?
Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!
I really thought he would show up. I waited... and waited... and waited...
I paid for it and everything.
Sometime?
Can I come in?
Mr. Spicoli, you're on dangerous ground here. You're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time.
You better save some for me, you swine!
I think I've made my point with you tonight.
Well, you'll find out next year.
Aloha, Mr. Hand!
You keep them.
Do you have Mrs. George for English?
Are you all right?
Do you mind if I excuse myself for a moment?
Well, I don't know, I may be doing some traveling this summer. I don't know how much I'll be around...  But I'll give you a call sometime.
What confused us was Dr. Gonzo's signature on the telegram from Los Angeles. When we knew he was right here in the hotel.
Of course, I could hear what the Clerk was really saying...
Certainly, Mr. Duke!
What's the message? My light is blinking.
The woman who left that message for you sounded very disturbed. I think she was crying...
Well, certainly... We're always happy to cooperate with the police...
Rum and ice, please.
"One toke over the line, sweet Jesus."
He said he understood, but I could see in his eyes that he didn't. He was lying to me.
Oh, Jesus! Did you see what god just did to us?
You better be careful. Plenty of vultures out here. They'll pick your bones clean before morning.
I was right in the middle of a fucking reptile zoo. And somebody was giving booze to these goddamn things! It won't be long before they tear us to shreds!
Look, what are we doing here? Are we here to entertain ourselves, or to do the job?
Jesus creeping shit!
That's what gives me The Fear.
Please, don't tell me those things... Not now.  This is my last drink. How much money can you lend me?
Where'd you get that knife?
What limes?
You're doomed. I'm leaving here in two hours and then they're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps. Right there in that tub.
Lucy.
NO! I felt sorry for the girl, I wanted to help her!
What?... What kind of goddamn monster are you?
Hell, in Malibu alone, these goddamn Satan worshippers kill six or eight people every day. All they want is the blood. They'll take people right off the street if they have to.
Yeh, naked!... except for the weapons.
Sometimes it's easier to just rip out the backstraps.
Man, your head would swell up like a watermelon, you'd probably gain about a hundred pounds in two hours...
Maybe she's telling the truth. Maybe she's not part of it.
Oh Lord! I'd do just about anything for that!
Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.
IS IT CLEAR?!
Well, it don't look pretty.
Hey! Get quiet or get out.
Okay, now. Easy steps. Easy breaths. Easy steps.
And that's how I ended up here.
So, your husband ditched you?
Jesus Christ, I'm gonna have a stroke.
Don't bullshit me! If you know a way out of this place and you're holding out --
What tunnel? Where?
You're trusting that guy? He'll ditch us and never look back.
I'm telling ya, you got the cloth too deep, you're asking for it.
Your brother, huh?
Your parents of relation?
We gotta be close.
Yeah, the lot's right there. My truck is right out back.
You wanna see, baby?
So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside?
In the kitchen, under the sink.
What?
What do you mean what?
What's going on between you two?
What's it for!?
Is it gassed up?
You young'uns worry about weapons, I'm thinkin' bout strategy.
Welcome back.
They were all over the place.
'Eh, Chief?
NO, but I will lock you in.
You are taking a chance that is not worth the risk.
Move it!
JUST A BAT! I'M FINE! JUST A BAT! SORRY!
Well, maybe they migrate?
Hold it!
Oh sweetheart! What was I thinking? Mommy is never gonna let you go. Oh Jesus... Never, ever, never let you go.
Come on, it's just what you need! Let everyone see you. Talk to them, live it up!
Look, Frances, I didn't want this job. Think I'm crazy? But you begged me: improve your image. So please... lemme try, huh?
Excuse me, sir?
Good morning, Mr. Bebe!
I guess so, sir.
No, I'm concerned with everything.
Hi Frances, got a minute?
Face it! Confess it! You're weak!
Good, good. Give them that.
Forgive my indulgence. Seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy. The point is, Mr. Odets here has written a wonderful play. Most of the roles are cast, but we haven't found our female lead...
Who?
A rich actress.
But... but wait a minute. We're supposed to be different, right? Clifford says... This theatre is supposed to be different! And this play... this play is all about what greed and money do to people!
What does Clifford say?
There've been some calls.
Hey, I'm not a complete fool, you know. I can see you're going sour on me, and when I try to do something about it, you turn your back and say it's nothing.
Oh, God! Let's get her out of here tonight, right now! Let's take her with us!
Let's get out of here! I'll lose my job!
...Don't you?
...I see.
This is the answer: a subscription drive to "Voice of Action!" First prize is a trip to Moscow! You could visit the art theatre, maybe even meet Stanislavski!
Yes, yes, it's all arranged. Everyone's collecting subscriptions in your name. And the best part is: the trip returns you to New York.
Bye, baby.
It's already started, Dad... with me.
What do I do, Dad?
I love you, Mama.  I love you, Dad.
I know that, Dad, but --
Dad... whatever I decide, will it be okay with you?
You know where you're taking me. You know what she'll do. Just give me a minute, slow down, give me an instant for once in your life, please?
You're poisoning that child's mind.
Kurt!
Address?
Hell yes!... well, okay, I'm still in school. But as soon as I graduate... California, here I come!
Why... yes.
You sound as if you hate it.
What?
Just one minute...
Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it.
Whattaya mean?
Sure don't talk like you're sixteen.
Harry.
You know, my old man was an inventor. Spent his whole life down in the basement trying to design transcontinental underground railroads, stuff like that. Well, I was supposed to be his partner. When I told him the smell of his workshop made me sick, I thought he was going to die right there.
Well... don't you think it's up to me to...
Jesus.
Shit. I meant the other way around.
You're telling me.
Well, she's back to earth now. They're all pretty huffed up about your leaving. I think you better go back, kid.
The chauffeur. He's watching.
Harry? Harry, where are you?!
What for?
Six months' probation...? You gotta learn when to do battle, Farmer. You're not going to win many bouts with 200 pound cops.
I just wanted to be part of something... one thing, one play or one movie, something that was really fine... memorable. And I could say: I did that, I made something good.
This is another one of your schemes to get me off alone...
I don't think I'd be much good in a war...
Frances, it's me, Harry?
I love you, Harry. I love you.
Been a lot of years, you know. A long time waiting. For what? End up feeling like a sap.
Right. Except... time has a way of --
And no people.
Did you expect him to look you up?
Miss Farmer, is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night?
Miss Farmer! In light of your flagrant disregard for the conditions of your probation, coupled with the unwarranted assault on the Plaintiff here... I am forced to order you to begin serving a sentence of 180 days in the County Jail.
That's me, Clifford.
Then show me! That's what I'm here for, to learn, to grow!
And here's one from nice Mr. Zeiss. He says that...
How long will you be?
At one. Promise?
Of course, she hasn't anything definite in mind.
Oh, just leave those things for now.
On behalf of the Seattle Ladies Club, as a token of our vast admiration --
I don't believe so.
I find these initial meetings to be much easier without the concerned relatives in attendance.
No... What I mean is... I'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life, that's all.
I'm sure you'll see it my way in the end.
I want outta here, you understand? I'm ready to get out! So you go back there... you go back and you tell them to let me out!
And do you think it's radical for a man to have a job and feed a family?
I don't know why they even bother. She's had enough of this to knock sense into a bull elephant.
I checked the files. This one holds the record for shock treatments. Four hundred seventeen and no end in sight.
Yeah, well, you know doctors. They sure hate to use that word.
You're an outcast.
What of my soul? Do I have one? Or was that a part you left out?  Who were these people of which I am comprised? Good people? Bad people?
What can I do?
And if I consent?
You will honor your promise to me!
Claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time. They say he never arrived.
God took her from us.
Smell the air. Wonderful.
You will.  What do you want, Victor?
This feels... incestuous.
If only I could. But one of us must stay. Father's not strong. Willie's just a child. Who can look after them in your absence? Who can run the estate?
I thought I'd never see you again!
We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.
Do you really think I'm mad?
Rich old ladies and their daughters?
Quite a few.
The entire school heard it. It wasn't something one could miss.
Now you've got him started.
They'll hang him all the same.
You're making a scene!
You can't. Death is God's will!
We all know how hard you took Waldman's death. Even Krempe is sympathetic. But it is time to move on. It is time to concern yourself with life.
Yes? And?
Murder Willie? In my heart, he was our child. Victor's and mine. Such a thing could never have entered my mind.
Philosophical?
Paracelsus?
Preposterous.
I heard.
Do you share my madness?
That's got her. Thanks. I'm Steve Christy. Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake. You got some grubby clothes? Climb into 'em. Alice, see if Bill has cleaned out the boathouse. I want him to start with the canoes. What happened to Brenda?
Next Friday.
Steve said for you to start on the boats.
Alice? The others show up?
You can only do what you can do.
It wouldn't matter except Steve should be getting back pretty soon. It wouldn't look so great if he fell over them.
I'll go check on Brenda.
What's the matter with it?
Somebody's there, Barry.
Let's go back, Barry...
This is almost like the one at my uncle's cabin in Maine.
I'll be okay. Holy shit...
Thanks.
Floor probably leaks. This area is full of springs.
Roll him over!
Chance to get even?
What do you want to be when you grow up?
Holy shit...
What hath God wrought?
Ha!
What about Neddy?
Looks like a storm.
It's just a dream.
Mmmmmmmph?
Cowboy.
Anything else you want?
I have six new counsellor up there. They're all babes in the woods in every sense of the word.
I mean...
If they get over the border, they're gonna let us go.
Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.
Not a chance.
How'd she die?
Come on, gimme some more details. How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk kill her?
Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don't they?
Didn't think so. So, as I was saying, I'm willing to make a deal. You behave, get us into Mexico, and don't try to escape. I'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning.
I don't have the slightest idea.
Out of the stew pot and into the fire.
What are you going to do?
To your family.
You all are gonna fuckin' die! I'm gonna fuckin' kill every last one of you godless pieces of shit!
Well, I say lets tear this place apart for weapons. So when they burst through that door, we'll make 'em wish they never did.
I promise.
That happens, you'll get it back.
It has a bed. That's all I care about.
About two hours from now.
Kate, we don't have all day, so I'm only gonna count to five. One...two... three... four...
Not good enough, swear to God.
How about you, cutie pie? Ready for round two?
Are you okay?
We have to go back for Daddy!
How many bullets left, kid?
I'm sorry.
Why, just look at all this. You got your kitchen --
-- you got your sink --
Not even for lunch?
Jesus Christ man, that microwave food will kill ya as quick as a bullet. Those burritos are only fit for a hippie high on weed. Pull me down a bottle of Jack Daniels. I'm gettin' tanked tonight.
What the hell would I do with that grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got enough of a cross to bear just taking care of that potato head. Then all this Abilene shit happened. You heard about that bank robbery in Abilene, didn't ya?
They'll probably make a run for the border, which would bring 'em this way. And if we get our hands on those shit asses, we're talking payback time. We'll get 'em all right. I gotta piss. I'm gonna use your commode.
Richie? You okay?
Do they have cable?
Do they have a waterbed?
How's it feel?
Shit, I started to get worried. Where the fuck ya been?
I gotta figure a way to get across that goddamn border. Longer we fuck around El Paso our lives ain't worth a shit.
Where's the woman?
Is this my fault? Do you think this is what I am?
Just say yes! Nothing else, just say yes.
You just called me a fuckin' nut.
I'm here with you.
My shit is together.
Well, then ask her, dumb ass.
Who's...  Lieuten --
Got it.
Wow...
Well, seein's how this thing is out, you let me handle the r.p.m.  From this point forward, I want all press matters coordinated via my office. I'll be god-damned if I'm gonna watch Hayes pull flowers out of his ass and take credit for this one. Him or the President.  This my shade?  "Midnight Mahogany"? 'Cuz I'm comin' dangerously close to lookin' like Ronald Reagan here.
Awright.  How's our girl doin', anyway?
So.  We're still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this -- for integrating the Spec-Recon training.  It may not always be smooth, but we're trying to make it as painless as possible for you.
Did you just have a brain-fart?
Straight up?
See me, sir?
Aw, what is this...
I ain't gonna shoot her.
Yes?
"Coronado."
Did you set me up?  Did you set me up just to see me fail?
So the rhetoric gets you headlines. But the reality gets you in trouble.
Don't have to use it, O'Neil, but it's gotta go out.  Five... four... three...
Time.
Thank you, sir.  But I like these just fine.
That was good headwork, lieutenant.
Probably hear back from CNN first.
Spec-Recon.  Those guys are world- class warriors.  And they will not want you there, Jordan.
I don't feel like doing an option paper on the rest of my life, Jordan.  Maybe we should just let it happen.
Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth.  But I'm trying to be honest, okay?  Three years is a long time.  Don't ask me to predict how I'll feel then, Jordan, because I don't know.  And either do you.
Still can't make up your mind, huh? Gotta go, Royce.
All I wanted was an honest chance. And If I couldn't get it, I couldn't stay.
Maybe.  Though it didn't seem like he was getting any satisfaction out of it.  Almost like...  Did I say he was class officer?
"John James Urgayle."  The Chief.
"Wickwire, Thomas Dane"... Second run at Coronado... and correct, they had him stashed in the "Appropriation Liaison Office," whatever that is.
Which is guy-speak for...
I can't go out.  Not like this.
I'm sorry, O'Neil.  But as class officer, it's my obligation to report all violations.
So we got two full mini-tanks, three minutes each.  'Cool?  How much air in yours?
Permission to get dressed, sir?
Why didn't you shoot the woman, O'Neil?
I'm not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage.  You wear the bars, you made the call, and you got your whole crew --
Didn't you know you'd be raped if you were captured?  Didn't you even think about that?
Sabotage born of economics? Wouldn't be a first.  But is Hayes really going to start his watch with such a public failure?
The White House.  If Jordan wins, DeHaven wins in spades.  Why?  Well, it's been said that the only man the President fears -- ain't no man.
Okay, so now work it from the other end.  Think about California -- and how things might be handled there.
Audrey's going to stay with us tonight.
What?
Yeah. Why are you asking?
What are you doing?
I still can't believe it. How does a guy go from an anti-nuke activists to working for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission?
And you think this creature is one of them?
You never said it was off the record.
The network is on an intranet. It's a direct feed into our computer system.
Can I use some?
Did you talk with Humphries?
Caiman, wait. Take me with you.
You don't understand, I can get us information...
Hi. Nick Tatopoulos...
Evacuate Manhattan? That's over three million people. Has that ever been done before?
I'm sorry about all this.
Merde!
They will set the trap at thirty minutes to ten.
That is our job.
Look, I may work for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission but accidents and spills are not my field.
You gave them the tape?
We think there's a strong reason to believe it may be hiding inside one of the buildings within the sequestered area.
General Anderson, the problem was the terrain. If we lure him out into a more open area such as this portion of Central Park...  We should be able to take him down.
SDECE, Service de Documentation Exterieure et de Contre-Espionnage. Agent Phillip Raymond.
It's the French Secret Service.
We have learned that your American friends have decided not to look for the creature's nest.
I need your trust if you're to help me find the nest.
How did you get all of this stuff into the country?
Here. 23rd street subway station. Where we first found the fish. With a little luck, this will lead us right to it.
What's with the chewing gum?
Sir! The pressure.  It's normalizing.
Don't speak, Quellek.
I'm glad you asked... To me the most important qualities of a Galaxy Explorer are loyalty...
Calm down everybody.   We're just here to negotiate General Sarris' surrender.
We've got to stop!
You don't hold a thruster down! It's for quick boosts
About this much.
There it is. The Beryllium sphere.
Go ahead!
What?  What?
ALEXANDER??? PLEASE? You're my advisor, advise me!
It's a DAMN ROCK MONSTER!!! It doesn't HAVE motivation!
Sense memory. I see you got to win the fight...
Oh Alex, get away from that thing...
Oh good, there's nothing to eat.
Yes, I know, and I want you to know I thought about what you said... I know you meant it constructively but...
Commander, do you have a camera?  I'd die to see this in person... All they showed on T,V was a machine here, and a wall here... I don't know why they didn't show the whole thing.
BRANDON!	TIME TO GO!
Commander, you and Lt. Madison will have to go through the crushers one at a time in three second intervals. Tell me when the first crusher hits the bottom...
Go. They're off again.
I just can't believe it. Any of it!  Look at this room!.. They designed it based on the Tuaran Pleasure ship from "historical document" thirty seven.  Oh and wait, wait, listen to this!  Computer?
Negative. The Beryllium sphere will have to be replaced.
Systems register functional.
The digital conveyer?  You mean I'm going to get diced into cubes and sorted up there in a thousand pieces?
How do you remember this stuff?
You Okay, Alex?
Guy, you HAVE a last name. We just don't KNOW it.
How the hell is Fred supposed to project a hologram?
Your last name.
That's it, that's what's going to kill me.
We~re oetting hammered, Jason.  Return fIre?
They're gone.
Let me try.  Computer?  Computer?...
We're leaving, Jason. We're leaving NOW.
We're going to fire everything we've got at him, all right?
I made the CUT THE LINE gesture. You nodded okay.'
Are they behind us?
Self control?  That's funny coming from the guy that slept with every Moon Princess and Terrakian slave girl on the show!...
He's accelerating to Mark 6.
Tommy, look!  Those lights...
First, I require the Omega 13... Second-
Yes.
Wait. What did you say?
But what if Sarris survives?
All right guys... Uh... Gwen and I are going to have to get to the core and shut it down manually. Fred, you and Guy need to get that air valve back on.  Alex, see if you can get the prison doors open downstairs in case Fred and Guy can't get the oxygen back in time.
Pedal to the metal Tommy...
Lieutenant Lathe, I confess I am beginning to feel a bit foolish myself. Chasing across the universe to obtain what is, I am now certain, a bauble of fiction. Tell me how best to obliterate this vessel? I would like nothing to remain.
Unfortunately, I'll never get the chance.  I'm leaving in an hour for Congress to scream like a violated virgin about my promotion.  Wasting my time, naturally... Look at her teasing those bumpkins.
What's your frank estimation of the British?
Our plan is to hit them as they leave.
As soon as the men have good shelters I'll move.  Perhaps Martha will join me this winter.
Colonel, sir, Mrs. Washington inquires if you are going to join her for dinner?
Wil...
Wil, I want to remind you of a conversation we started just before Monmouth...
No uniforms.  No coats, even?  In this weather?
And, is that a pitchfork beside him?
By red, what rank would you say this black, officer, soldier is, Colonel?
I am to take command of Major General Lafayette's division and lead the attack.
Who is that!?
General Washington, is there actually going to be a compromise, I mean, a 'deal' with England?
That young school teacher... I heard the British hung him as a spy.
Have you decided if you are going to join the Virginia Delegation to the Constitutional Convention?
You won't be needing his largess, Rhode Island is already committed to your appointment.
George, I'm sorry.  We all know the army will acquit Arnold...
Makes you gag.
Any word from Canada?
Colonel Reed...
A grand scheme?
What do you mean you're not a Christian?  Of course you're a Christian, we're all Christians...
Arnold is indispensable, do you understand?  I need Arnold to help me win this war!
'Continentals', Congress' paper money.  It was worthless to start with, but as you see, counter feiters have made them even less than worthless.  Can you tell which one is fake?
Surely you knew this was coming.
Well, a very real expectation is the British will hang you!  They'll burn Mount Vernon and they'll hang you!  Our marriage is a business just as surely as...
That's right...
Did you know that Jefferson has proposed a law in Virginia aiming at an absolute separation of state from the church?
It's an anti-Christian dogma!  I cannot believe you are so calm about it!
To win this war I need an army.
Not today.
But, you do come from a military family?
The only way to get discipline into these men is to beat it into them! Fifty lashes each!
I certainly didn't mean you.  Of course you are a gentleman, an officer and a gentleman.
What the hell are we doing?
If the constitution is ratified... we'll have a country.  They'll want to elect you president of the convention, which means president of the country.
You remember, George, when we were 'studying' the great philosophers?
Oh, but you must not mind my talking about you!  In fact, William says my main job here at Belvoir is to civilize you; to make an honest English gentleman out of you.
Think what the play means, William. Perhaps these words have a place in the real world.
All people have rights!
And 'others', say... have you even read Locke, Vattel, Voltaire, Diderot...
You hear that?
The land here is best for grain and corn.
His foot. Jeez, poor Ronnie...
After this one, I'm out, Cat, you understand? This is the last time we talk to each other.
You get the money?
I don't know how I could've missed you with that shirt on. It's the same as the other one you had only the hibiscus are a different color. Right?
I think I pulled my quadriceps.
I wonder, would that work?  You know who I see for Al Roxy? Harvey Keitel. The man could do it in his sleep.
Yeah, I read it. I was just thinking you could make her older. We might even be able to get Karen Flores.
You know how to write one of these?
She's great. Gimme the money.
Only this time, no John Wayne and Dean Martin shooting the bad guys in El Dorado.
You positive about that?
He was watching Letterman, huh? Sneaky, that Chili Palmer.  So, he ever find this dry cleaner, the one with all that money on him?
C-18.
I work for Harry Zimm, alright?
Why would I do that?
I checked the bag at the airport, when I came.
Who the fuck are you?
You're an investor, is that it?
By the way, you recall the number of the locker you used?
Something shouldn't be there.
A marker's like a check, Harry.
You make movies, huh?
That's half a movie, with holes in it. Maybe forty minutes of screen time. You don't even have a girl, a female lead, and on top of that, there's no one to sympathize with, you don't have a good guy.
You mean, Leo?
I'm not the guy, Harry.
I'm out here looking for Leo. I just looked you up as a favor to your dear friend, Dick Allen.
You're trying to tell me how you fucked up without sounding stupid, and that's hard to do. Let's just get to where you're at, okay? You blew the two hundred grand the limo guys gave you in Vegas on a basketball game and you haven't told 'em about it. Why not?
You got that on the brain, Harry. If you're so scared of 'em why'd you take their money to Vegas to begin with?
What's it called?
"Mr. Lovejoy"? That's the title?
Two time academy award nominee, Martin Weir.
One of his best parts.
The problem is Murray. He and a few other blocked screenwriters went river rafting down the Kern a few weeks ago. Murray never made it back.
What do you get out of this?
You don't say any more'n you have to. You say, 'Well, I'm glad you assholes stopped by, so I can set you straight.'
You tell me you want these guys off your back. Next thing I know, you're saying yeah, maybe they can have a piece of Mr. Lovejoy. I couldn't believe my fuckin' ears.
That's the difference between you and me, Harry. I say what I mean. I want something from someone, I ask 'em straight out. I want Martin Weir, I go get Martin Weir. I don't fuck around with his trainer's shrink.
Okay, Harry, I'm wrong. You're not the one he's setting up.
Yeah, he told me.
Yeah, Ray, he personally told me he got killed in that Get Away Airlines' jet went down last month.
It was in the Herald.
I'm thinking of a movie.
No, I want you to look at me the way I'm looking at you. Put it in your eyes, 'You're mine, asshole,' without saying it.
That's what I think of you, asshole. Nothing.
I wouldn't think you're that dumb, leave over three hundred grand in the closet, underneath the extra blanket, but I guess you are.
It's all mine.
It's not one of these?
Mr. Barboni is a good customer.  Works for Jimmy Capp.
A couple days ago by, people from the airliner come to see his wife, tell her how sorry they are and all that their plane exploded and offer her a settlement, the amount based on what he would've earned operating the dry cleaner's the rest of his life. Leo had some kind of trouble with his kidneys, so they were giving him about ten years.
Rough day on the set?
You saw that one?
How come you stopped making movies with Harry?
You read Harry's new one? He says it's the best thing he's ever read.
Harry told me Martin loves it, he flipped.
Well, I gotta have a talk with Leo, my runaway dry cleaner.
Oh, I like him. I just think he's... short. I mean, he's a good actor and all, but I'm wondering what it was exactly you saw in Marty.
I think you could be an actor. I know you're acting sometimes, but you don't show it.
You sure?
Were you scared up there?
I hate to say I told you, but I did. I told you don't start nothing with him that time.
No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.
Whatta you doing out there?
What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?
Yeah, but whose point of view?
Hm?
I miss Murray, Harry.
How did you get in the house?
With your experience, you could always become an agent. Right, Harry?
Which two?
Roger, North Island. I am tied to the passenger vessel Chimera. And she is afloat. Repeat, she is afloat. Over.
How about now?
Damn mind of it's own.
Yeah, but not as cold as those Swedish girls you only gonna dream about.
Where's his boat, then? Where's his crew? He ain't gonna be out here by himself, that's for damn sure.
Probably slipped her moorings, got tangled up in a current.
Seeing as though a foot of one of these fuckers weighs about a hundred pounds, it ain't gonna be what you'd call easy.  Any questions?
Fifty million dollars. Fifty million. We gonna let this guy just take it from us? One guy?
What say, Epps? You up for some roasted albatross?
Dodge.  Dodge.
If you get it back in one piece.
It's a bloody navigation hazard. One boat can't control a ship that size.
I thought you said it was just a blade.
How much longer's that gonna take?
Went aboard.
Or somebody stopped them.
If somebody's aboard her already, she ain't ours. She's theirs.
What if that fucker finds it before we're ready to go?
Bodies're too fresh.
That'd be my guess.
You better get down here quick, skipper. I'm on "C" deck. Cabin 400.
It was a man's voice. Repeating some sort of children's rhyme. I don't know, it didn't make any sense. You didn't hear it?
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?!
The radio!
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
Then why didn't they take it.
Two hundred twenty two kilograms of solid gold.
Any dizziness?
What?
Ever heard of the Mary Celeste?
So, we find this guy and make a deal with him.
Guess that'd be me. Again.
No cowboy shit up there, understand?
Got your light?
Murphy to Epps.
The ah... the radio's out.
When you found me yesterday, at the pool. I'd seen... something.  Someone.
What, like some kind of ghost?
Maybe hallucination is the wrong word. It was more than that. As though they were showing me.
What do we do with him?
Over the gold.
And now you're gonna kill me, is that it?
Let the buyer beware.
I been watching it for close to an hour and it hasn't moved. I can't raise it on the radio either. Makes me think it might be in trouble.
Murphy, goddamit.
So what? We gonna unload the gold and get a move on?
Fifty million four ways. That's twelve million and change a piece.  What you gonna do with your share, skipper?
Never been more thirsty in my life.
Last thing I remember I was aboard the Chimera. Down somewhere in there scavenging around.
Say what?
We're not gonna be able to pump it!
It's a Noaa buoy.
Did I tell you who I ran into at the bagel place?
Hi.  Look, I'm kind of tired - I think I'll go to bed.
Well, Maxine thinks she can get you a sales job at Computer Station. Normally you have to have references and at least two years of experience, but she thinks she can convince them.
What do you mean "on his way up"!?
I'm so excited to see this film - Dustoffvarnya is such a brilliant director! Did you see his last film, The Flower That Drank The Moon? It was simply glorious!
Seymour?... uh... hello... I guess I'm a little early...
What are you trying to say?
Who is this, Enid?
Did you actually do this painting?
Hmm.
Enid! I'm so sorry about what happened.
What the hell is wrong with you?!
Well hello there, young employee of the Sidewinder.
Yeah, right.
I just stopped in to say hi.
Do you want something to drink?
What do you mean "why"?
Yeah, right...
You must have known all along how I -- you know -- how I felt about you -- it must be totally obvious...  God... I always used to dream about this...
I know, I liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict! She gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she's Little Miss Perfect and everybody loves her.
These assholes are saying that I have to go to Summer school and take some stupid art class!
Remember that stupid hippie art teacher who failed me sophomore year? I didn't think that just because you get an "F" that means you have to take the class over again.
This is so bad, it's almost good.
Just think, we'll never have to see any of these creepy faces ever again.
Since when is she an "actress"?
Oh my god, look! Is Stacy Himmler going out with Rod Harbaugh?
So, when are we going to start looking for our apartment?
Hey, look, the satanists are leaving!
Much later.
You can have that one.
I know. And he's like psychotically obsessing over every little detail.
Hey - why do you have this?
Hey! We forgot to call the loser!
You know, the green cardigan guy.
You call.
God, I think Josh is too mature for us.
Look, maybe that's him!
SHUT UP!
Ew, look at this...
There he is...
How about this one?
How about this?
Let's get out of here, this place makes me sick.
It's a surprise.
Anthony's II!
That guy is totally amazing.
That rules!
I'm working on it... I've got a few leads... it's just that right now I have, all these projects that take up all my time.
You're just jealous.
What are you talking about? What kind of loser gets fired after one day?!
If it makes you feel any better, I don't think you could've gotten more than ten bucks for all this stuff.
Do you want to do something tonight?
Well, are we still going shopping tomorrow?
No, really...
I am not -- I just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do...
Yeah, but maybe one of us should at least try...
How repulsive!
Just some people from work...
What?! It looks totally normal... what's wrong with it?
You're the psycho! You haven't been able to deal with anything since high school ended!
Oh my God, you guys! I can't believe we made it!
Perhaps the "Jam-in-ator" appeals to you.  Absolutely no practice necessary.  You shread like a giant. Just press a button.
Who does?
Don't mind me, I'll just be in my room.
Didn't they tell you?
Punk rock is over!
Why do you even want it? It would look stupid on you.
Yeah, it took a while before I got a chance to play it, but when I heard that song it was like --
Yeah, that's good too... the whole record was good, but that one song, "Devil Got My Woman" -- I mostly just keep playing that one over and over... Do you have any other records like that?
Oops! I dropped it!
I'm talking to you... I'll bet there are tons of women who would go out with you in a minute!
Mark my words, by the end of this summer you'll be up to your neck in pussy!
C'mon Seymour, I'm trying to collect data here! Don't you want me to find you your perfect dream girl?
Yeah yeah yeah... Just tell me your five main interests, in order of importance.
Well are --
I really don't think it's a good idea.
Relax, Seymour, relax...
So, why did you bring this along?
Wait a minute! Hang on! Jesus, I gotta think of something to talk to her about. No! No...
What did you tell that girl?
Yeah, well, I can't relate to humanity either, but I don't think it's totally hopeless...
Actually, I was a whole lot more interested in the Cook's phenomenon when I was about your age. I've kind of lost interest since I've been working for them...
So, I don't really get it -- are you saying that things were better back then  even though there was stuff like this?
What is that?
I know. It's not like it makes all your problems go away.
Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a joke -- you have to call her back!
Uh... hello?
Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you... I've been wandering the streets day and night trying to find you...
No... no, it's just that I should get going in a few minutes, and --
Well forget the art show... let's do something else.
In what way do you mean?
I don't know... I'm sorry, but Dana's a very jealous person. I just don't want to screw that up right now... I'm sure she'll dump me soon and we can go back to being friends...
What's up?
God, she's going to kill me... this bottle is half-empty!
What?... Maybe... no... I dunno...
No... forget it...
I was just thinking out loud...  I mean, you've got this whole thing with Dana -- I'm not going to let you fuck that up...
Let me tell ya somethin', Joe... Listen to me, Joe... you can't hit a home run without swinging the bat!
Maybe she's got another boyfriend.
Please Josh?
Did you remember to pay the phone bill?
Talk to us about it...
I have no idea - I just want to...
What are you talking about?
Thank you, doctor.
No hints, Samuel.
I am a man of peace.
Most certainly. Absolutely. Yes.
-build the bridge over the Tsavo river. And be finished in four months time. Can you do that?
Pleasant journey?
Understand, I had help-
You're certain about tomorrow?  But you don't seem excited. 
Oh dear-  -you're geting that downtrodden look again-
-oh please- if I'd been against your taking this, you would have abandoned me. You've been desperate to see Africa your whole life.
Go, now.  Such a gentleman. 
Many thanks.  You're Patterson, yes?  Nigel Starling- I'll be assisting you at Tsavo- but surely Beaumont must have told you that.
Don't much like them.
Every time I see something like that, I know we're right to be here- to bring Christianity into their lives, enrich their souls.
We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes-  -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.
Samuel is camp liaison- absolutely indispensable- the only man here everyone trusts.
Excellent. Could I see the bridge site? 
Finish your tour?
I hate to be a bother, John, but the cramp's getting worse.  The pain is actually quite unbearable now.
Since you'd only been here three hours when we met, are you sure this is how you hunt lions?
With much more on the way-  -John- we could have had this chat on flatter ground-
I didn't have a chance to thank you.
Actually, no.
Think about something else.
It would have been a beautiful bridge, John. I never noticed before, occupied with other business, I	suppose...  ...never really pay much attention to that kind of thing but I've had the time today, nothing else on, and this... it's graceful and the placement couldn't be prettier... and... 
I'll be bait alone?
It's certainly the best chance they've had to kill you.
The workers don't get on?
Soon. 
Where do you go next?
My life was shaped because someone invented gunpowder. Our lives have crossed because two lions went mad. But what if in the future the three of us do something grand for humanity? Was that worth all the lives? Too soon to tell.
Every day I ask you, and every day you've got something else to do.  Do I have bad breath or something?
Janosz?
Okay, just thought I'd check.  Good night, Dana.  Sleep well.  Don't let the bedbugs bite you.
If this is what the world will be like, I don't want to live in it.
Time is running out, Dana.  Soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine -- and Vigo's.  Well, mainly Vigo's.  But we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship.
Oh no.
Occasionally
Thank you, Frank.  Oh, are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom?  I asked you last week.
He ditched you.  You should've married me, you know.
Peter, this is serious.  I need to know if you think there's anything unusual about him.
I wish I could stay.  I feel personally responsible for you being here.
Good luck.
Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this nightgown?
Be careful on that sofa -- it's a butt-biter. But the bed's good and I just changed the sheets so if you get tired, feel free.  In fact, I think you should definitely plan on spending the night here.
They didn't find anything?  In the bathtub ... the pink ooze ... nothing?  So, what do I do now?
Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe?
I'm not even good for me.
I think he likes you.  I think I do too.
Before you go running to the newspapers with this, would you consider telling this slime thing to some people downtown?
Have you made any plans yet?  You know tomorrow is New Year's Eve.
It's really not a bad place.  It just needs a woman's touch.
Should we go?
I'm not sure this is such a good idea?  Do they know you're doing this?
It's a painting I'm restoring for the new Byzantine exhibition.  It's a self-portrait of Prince Vigo, the Carpathian.  He ruled most of Carpathia and Moldavia in the 17th Century.
I'll let you get back to it.  Nice meeting you.
Then why have you come?
So you see, everything is in order, is it not?
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia --
I command you.
Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in contempt.
These boys aren't playing around.
Your honor, may I approach the bench?
Come on, Sherm.  You're my cousin.  Do this for me.  I'm begging you.
Hi, welcome back to the 'World of the Psychic,' I'm Peter Venkman and I'm chatting with my guest, author, lecturer and of course, psychic, Milton Anglund.  Milt, your new book is called The End of the World.  Isn't that kind of like writing about gum disease.  Yes, it could happen, but do you think anybody wants to read a book about it?
Okay, so can you tell us when it's going to happen or do we have to buy the book?
This year?  That's cutting it a little close, isn't it?  I mean, just from a sales point of view, the book just came out, right?  So you're not even looking at the paperback release for maybe a year.  And it's going to be at least another year after that if the thing has movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential. You would have been better off predicting 1992 or even '94 just to be safe.
So what are you saying?  That the world of the supernatural is your special province?
From where -- Neptune?
This one's interesting.  Berlin, 1939, a flower cart took off by itself and rolled approximately half a kilometer over level ground.  Three hundred eyewitnesses.
The New York Pneumatic Railway.  It was an experimental subway system.  Fan-forced air-trains, built around 1870.
I'm Egon --
No, not exactly a man of the people.  "Also known as Vigo the Cruel, Vigo the Torturer, Vigo the Despised, and Vigo the Unholy."
If you two are looking for a fight, you got one.  Who wants it first?  Come on, Ray.  Try me, sucker.
It won't work.  There's no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell.
Nowhere -- fast.  Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub?
Great.  So what are you guys working on?
Who, Ray?
Careful, Winston.  He's a mean one.  And to celebrate our grand reopening, we're giving you twice the value with our special half-price 'Welcome Back' service plan.
This is what you do with your spare time?
What kind of tests?
I think we're going to have to pass on the sewer trip, boys.  Let me know what you find out.
I'll keep to the middle of the channel. We're okay to 59th Street, then we'll go ashore and take First Avenue to 79th.
I don't think they make Nikes in her size.
Does it have any favorites?
You got a flux and a half.
Now that's one ugly dude.
You finished here?
Are you all right?  You coming down with something?
I don't care what you say.  This could be a major Christmas gift item.
Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?
Roy?  Your clock broke.
Now where are you going?
Okay.  I'll take a raincheck.  I always have plenty of mineral water and other nutritious health foods, but you know that.  Listen, that reminds me, I'm having a party for all my clients.  It's gonna be my fourth anniversary as an accountant.  I know you fill out your own tax return, but I'd like you to come being that you're my next door neighbor and all ...
Oh, Dana, it's you.
You play the cello!  It's my favorite instrument.
I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.
There's nothing there now and I don't get any significant readings.
Don't scream.
You're the best one in your row.
Who's the stiff?
You must have gotten the last copy.
Hey, Dana.  What is it?  What happened?
We must prepare for the coming of Gozer.
Thank you for coming.  I'd appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly.
And someone from the EPA is here to see you.
I see.  And now you catch ghosts?
And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman?
And may I see this storage facility?
I'll tell you the effect!  It pisses me off!
What on earth gave you that idea?
Spengler, are you serious about actually catching a ghost?
Generally, you don't see that kind of behavior in a major appliance.  What do you think, Egon?
Something was definitely here.
I'm with Dana Barrett and she's floating three feet off the bed.
All right.  I'll try.
Yes.  After the First World War Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive.  And he wasn't alone.  He had close to a thousand followers when he died.  They conducted rituals, bizarre rituals, intended to bring about the end of the world.
Look at the structure of the roof cap.  It looks exactly like the kind of telemetry tracker NASA uses to identify dead pulsars in other galaxies.
What is it?
If you guys are right, if we can actually trap a ghost and hold it somehow, I think I could win the Nobel Prize.
You said you floored 'em at the Regents' meeting.
Third floor.  Get down here,
It's here, Ray.  It's looking at me.
Egon, how's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
I couldn't help it!  It just popped in there!
AND YOU CAME UP WITH THAT?
Are you a Christian, Ray?
Ray, do you remember something in the Bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves?
Right.  And the sky would fall ...
Yeah, Judgement Day.
Stantz?  You okay in there?
More wine, sister?  Surely you can drink more than that.
Don't you think you should at least wave?
It's disgusting!  Animals!  I had to come here under armed guard.  Slaves -- get this junk out of my sight.
I am their hero!
Lykas, pick a man.  Someone who will look good.  Jerses I want it built up in the Daily Action...
Endorse me in public.  Do that and I'll make you rich and set you free. I'll return your estates.  I know you would give anything to be outside again.  Endorse me and you will be free.  Think of it.  What would you do with your freedom?
Gods of hell!  This must cost a fortune!  How many days is this going to go on?
Maybe it'll crush Gaius.
Take grain away from the army?
Caesar, let me sponsor your first wager in the arena.
Gladly, Caesar.  And, if you'd like we can take you for a tour of the front at first light.
Where is my father?
Tribuus, what happened in the arena? Was Narcissus killed?
Why isn't he dead?  Damn you, you promised me he would be dead!
Tribuus!  Go left here, I want to see my new statue at Via Claudia.
You won an impossible fight.  You got the attention of the crowd, legate...
AGH!  Please!  He's having a secret device constructed for the circus. The brass craftsmen are working overtime.
The battle was won, today, and I prefer to believe it was a gift of Janus, the eldest God of Rome.  God of my ancestors.
I came here to see that you stay alive.  The people need a living breathing alternative to Commodus, a hero.
Twenty years I've led men to die. For me it was the glory of Rome. But that was something.  If it wasn't that, then it was the pay or the loot of the next whore -- but that was something!  These men here are butchered for laughs!  Their lives are like jokes delivered in the back alley theaters where their death is a punch line!
"If you consider yourself to be only one thread of many in the tunic, then it is fitting for you to be like the rest of men, just as the thread has no desire to be any better than the other threads. But..."
Marcus would have lived but... was poisoned by his son.
I want you to start your work for the last phase of the campaign.
Everyone talking about it?  I wouldn't wonder.  All I seek is a genuine balance of power between the Emperor and the Senate.  Thus I have transferred legal power -- which was theirs to begin with -- back to the Senators.  This includes a shared right to taxation too but some bite in the plan.  It's a start, only a start.  If the Emperor and the Senate can share power then the people will be ready to take their share.  This means Commodus has to bend; does he strike you as that type?
A man should be upright, not be kept upright.  History shows us that a good general is quick to recognize opportunities -- even if it means making a complete about face at the last minute.  I want you to consider becoming my heir.
I made the plume from a quail feather.
As soon as I can.
Serious stuff...
This is our oil from our estates?
I want to come home, of course I do, I'd have to be mad not to want that. It's just that Marcus trusts me.
They'll have me.  Teach them.  Don't let them become like these ignorant heaps of citizens without history, without philosophy, without meaning. Teach them of the Greeks, the Babylonians, the Hebrews, the Numidians, the Egyptians and the great Romans.  Teach them, who we are!
Take your hands off me animal!
Legate Narcissus Meridas, general of the Spanish Felix Legions!  I'm proud to have you in my school!  Now, show them what you can do!
General, hang on... drink slowly. You are blessed by the Gods to have a physician and a Divine of Janus with you tonight.  A fan sent them to you.
Tell me honestly, since this may be our last earthly meeting:  if this were a fair fight where would you put your money?
Such nobility from such an ignoble mouth.  Take my advice and make that bet.
No.  Tell them I'll do it.  But I want more posters all over Rome.
Let's talk about this later.  Right now we have other things to settle. You and your family will be leaving with a supply ship returning in the morning to Ostia.  From there, Caesar has decreed you be given an estate in Paestum.  It's beautiful; an old Greek town right on the ocean.  Rich soil.  Perhaps we could keep our financial arrangements... although Caesar will give you a sort of pension it's always good to look to the future, keep your hand in the arena... so to speak.
Hello.
Aren't you eating?
Benjamin -- do you dislike me for some reason?
I think I'd better go home now please.
What?
We won't. Let's go inside.
Benjamin --
Ben -- what's happening? Who is Mr. Gladstone?
Do you?
I do.
What is it?
-- really incredible --
What?
No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?
I said I think it is.
Please let me go.
Benjamin -- this is my mother!
Can I just sit here while you're packing?
What are you looking for?
How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy but --
Elaine -- are you serious about this?
We could go down and get our blood tests tomorrow.
Or this afternoon. It's a good day for it.
Who -- that guy at the Zoo?
What are you then?
You're not one of those agitators?
One of those outside agitators.
Oh -- hello, Mr. McCleery.
See -- she's just having some water. Now there's no need for the cops or anything.
What for?
Where are you?
What?
Where is it?
Is there an ashtray in here?
Whatever it is you're upset about.
Thank you.
Will you come in, please?
Benjamin -- I'm sorry to be this way, but I don't want to be alone in this house.
Please wait till my husband gets home.
What do you think of me?
Did you know I was an alcoholic?
Oh my God.
I mean -- you didn't really think that I would do something like that.
Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick that I said that to you.
Her portrait?
I don't remember her as having brown eyes.
Won't you unzip my dress?
Haven't you ever seen anybody in a slip before?
But they would! Don't you see?
I know that. But please, Mrs. Robinson. This is difficult for me.
Do you understand what I said?
Benjamin?
You don't have to be so nervous, you know.
Do you want me to get it?
Why don't you get it.
I got a single room.
Yes?
Benjamin -- do you find me undesirable?
-- of bring -- inadequate -- I mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way --
Yes I do. I know quite a bit about it.
You're not interested in art?
There isn't any.
We're talking.
Right.
So you don't -- I mean I don't like to seem like I'm prying but I guess you don't sleep together or anything.
Well how long has this been going on.
How many times a year.
What?
Well I can't.
And you were a student also.
What was your major?
I'm curious.
Oh no. In the car you did it?
Don't talk about Elaine.
Well -- I guess I'll have to ask her out on a date and find out what's --
Good.
I'm not good enough for her to associate with, am I? I'm not good enough to even talk about her, am I?
We're not dropping it. Now that's the reason, isn't it? I'm a dirty degenerate, aren't I? I'm not fit to --
Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
What are you doing?
But it's not.
Yes. Please. I want you to.
All right, for christ's sake. I promise I will never take out Elaine Robinson.
Now listen -- this was not my idea. It was my father's idea.
Hello. Get me the police, please.
What have you done to her?
I say I've got it.
The toothbrush. I got it all right.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
I drive around.
I do.
I'm not. But I'm -- I'm not very proud of what I do. I usually get kind of drunk. I usually drive over to Los Angeles and go to some bars and get kind of drunk. Then I take a hotel room. So I won't have to drive home on the freeway. I mean it kind of scares me to drive home after --
I'm going up to Berkeley today.
Well --
Would you mind telling me then -- what were those four years of college for? What was the point of all that hard work?
How do you know? You haven't seen her since high school. I guess your evenings, whatever you do with them, are just too valuable.
Wait a minute. You talked to Elaine this morning?
She doesn't know that you're coming up to Berkeley?
Here. It looks like you need a refill.
Thank you.
How long have you and I known each other? How long have your Dad and I been partners?
So I hope you won't mind my giving you a friendly piece of advice.
That's what I'd do if I could. Nothing wrong with that. Hey Ben, Elaine's coming down from Berkeley soon. I want you to call her up this time.
Hello.
Now look -- please --
No, I don't.
Is anything wrong?
The Carlsons' are here.
The floor clerk is out there in the corridor -- she sees everything ---
How?
Poor girl -- chloroform would give her a rotten headache... I know -- I had it in the war. Besides, she's very pretty -- not young but --
I've quit.
I'll pay you back.
He must be very nice.
I'll do anything for you.
Why?
You live here?
Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.
Please do not be frightened, Madam.
Don't cry -- it tears my heart to see you sob like that.
Not quite strange now. It is as if I had been expecting you. You know, once when the Grand Duke was alive, I found a man hiding in my room -- a young officer --
Go away. Who are you --?
What can you see?
The veronal -- you. I'm going to stay here with you.
But now, you must go... I give you the pearls. But now you must go ---
Grusinskaya --
I want to be good to you -- madly good.
Bless you...
Why?
Hello -- sorry I'm late.
Was the Baron joking, or is it really true that the Baron is -- in financial straits.
That was my last.
Here -- here it is. Here's your pocketbook, Kringelein.
Oh -- good evening, Baron.
Perhaps you could present me now, Mr. Pimenov.
For me?
The night clerk has already gone -- you are late.
Anyone asked for me?
I know -- I know -- when a man's collar is an inch too big for him -- I know he is ill.
There is no pocketbook here... On the floor probably. 
Oh, I've got to find it.
Her master's voice!  I must go now -- goodbye -- thanks.
You like music?
You dance splendidly.
Oh -- oh, Miss Flaemmchen. It's you --
What...! --
Moreover --
Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel? 
I'm going to keep an eye on that Kringelein fellow. I'll find out where he gets the money to hang around the Grand Hotel.
I must go to England -- at once.
Of course -- of course. 
Insolent young cub!
Oh -- ho -- you want legal aid against us? -- The whole thing seems to me to be very simple.
What?
There's a lot of business to be done with the Manchester Cotton Company. They've the whole English market right in their hands. Have you any connections with -- Manchester?
Oh -- yes -- I beg your pardon!
I'd like to wait for Justice Zinnowitz, before I commit myself.
Now to proceed with the projected merger, the advantages for the Saxonia are so obvious...
Tentative my foot -- a month before this your old father-in-law came very privately and scratched at my door.
I know you did -- I said you did --
I thought we'd suspended negotiations, gentlemen.
...and let me say again for the tenth time...  ...you people were quite ready for the merger. You declared yourselves... fully agreed on all the terms -- Why should the signing of these articles be suddenly held up?
You're a deep one.
Ah, oui -- the car is here for Madam.
Yes, Madam. And now Madam will sleep. It is not long 'till the train.
Madam, it is Mr. Meierheim -- he is waiting downstairs.
What is this that you have cancelled your car? Who am I that I should wait like a fool at the door? And here on a whim, you cancel your car. Have you forgotten there is a performance? Do you know the time? Or, are we all mad? Am I your manager?... Have we a contract? Have we obligations? Am I blind?  ...Or is that the time?
Oh! Madam is cancelling the engagement. Madam has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke. Ha, ha, ha -- hurry, come on. Tonight -- there's a line in front of the theatre since six o'clock. The house is jammed to the roof.
Oh, the sun -- it will be sunny in Tremezzo --
Last night?... There was no applause.
Gru -- you are positively radiant.
Certainly, sir.
Well now, Miss Flaemm, we can talk.
Oh -- the Baron -- the Baron.
We will wait.
Four minutes past. Please come.
Ach! Here you are, Doctor Zinnowitz.
No. No word.
I want to dictate my statement for tomorrow. I can't speak without notes. I like to have things down before me in black and white.
Good morning, gentlemen -- I see the conference is already underway.
What's the matter with you?
What's bluff?
Pretty as a picture.
No.
You want a drink?
You're a thousand percent right!
Your kid's in the back here. He's crying.
Henry, next time, couldn't Mister Hebbing --
Want a look?
Cole, it'll be all right. Honey?
Demon! Demon! That's why you can walk on it! Demon!
Well, that's what the law's for, isn't it?
His blood pressure is under a hundred. I don't think he'll live to get to the hospital.
Take two, three days. Call when you get there.
Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.
Well, I'd have to see it, of course.
What? Me?
Well, uh... No.
And I'm Perk. Short for Percy, I'm afraid.
A well-rounded life. I respect that. But it has to have a center, Roy, something you care about, something you can think about.
You're one to talk. Still running playback money for the mob.
Roy, I don't want money from you.
Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down. Take a minute, tell me about it.
I sat in there with her, I thought, what do I do now? Run and I've got Bobo and the law after me. Stay, and how do I explain?
I'm sorry. I hated to take your money, but --
I need this, Roy. I can't run without money, and if I can't run I'm dead.
At what?
What?
Roy, that's fine, but I don't have time for this. Bobo --
Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after me, and he's goddamn good! But so am I. I'm a survivor, Roy. I survive.
Joe, could we talk it over? Do you want a drink?
I can't. I just left home.
Where's the five?
Well, well. In a real hurry, are we?
Look at me.
Roy? It this all we have?
Well, no, Roy. Your mother found you.
I don't see why you're still here. You look healthy to me.
You're just comfortable, that's all. You don't even ask to go home. You just lie around, let your mama take care of you.
I don't like to come here, Roy. Every time I do, your mother comes in and makes remarks.
Get well soon.
I don't see why we have to take the train.
What if we want to drive somewhere while we're there?
Big spender.
Great to get away, take it easy. Next week, I'll get back to work.
What?
You're on the grift. Same as me.
Is that right?
I just bet you are, too. And now you're trying to rope me.
Take a hike, you mean?
) The track? Did you run into Lilly?
Running your broker scam, you mean.
And hello to you, too.
That's what I say.
What's that?
You watch that mouth.
What?
Not many laughs in this room, eh?
Oh, Jesus.
Why am I here?
As which point she drops to her knees in pain...
We're sorry to startle you, Miss Tate.
Carter.
Bruce... what's going on?  The kids are here to pick out their costumes for the festival.
Do you know who did this?
Think Eddie had something to do with it?
Another historical inaccuracy.
Hey, Mis Whittington, what's up?
Jimmy, what are you doing?
Don't think so.  But they sure did a real number on your office. Crap everywhere.
Alright, I was wrong.  There is a big difference between rooming with your buddies and living with your mother and school headmaster.
Shit, John!  What the hell were you doing out there?!
Wrong.  There are rules in this house and you're going to follow them whether you like it or not.
You some kind of fugitive or something?
He found you, didn't he?
I'm not leaving without her.
Keri.... Laurie... how about if I just call you Mom?
Not me.
Nah, I didn't tell her where I went.
You really think Eddie killed her?
Aren't they doing a terrific job this year?
The tighter you squeeze, the harder he'll try to break free.
I'm going into town... run a few errands before dark.  Need anything?
What are you looking at?
There's something I have to tell you both.  It's going to sound strange...
Who?
No, Will, this isn't the alcohol talking.  It's the truth.
Keri, you all right?
I have to pee.
I'll pop a Benadryl.
Nope.  Hey, you think I'll win scariest costume?
Beth, who's that guy that lives across the hall from you?
What are you doing there?  Where's my mother?
Hold on, hot lips.  We got work to do.
Jesus, that's my neighbor.  Tommy.
No, Mom -- keep it on!
Mom, I want to go to the fair ...
I can't.  The voice man is coming to get me.
See what I'm talkin' about?
John, they sound Jamie Lloyd this morning! Someone tried to kill her!
He crept up these stairs and made his way into this room.  His sister's room. Right here. Where it all began.
She wasn't here when I brought Danny home from --
My, God!  What have you done to him?
Kyle's mother might be dead for all I know. Now I'm afraid he could be next.
What now?!
Christ, what a night!  Not even so much as a sign for five miles on that road!
There you are.  Who was that boy?
No one's home.  Checked it out myself.
Where's the child?
Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by your own reality to see.  But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways.  You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog. Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell.
No!!!
No -- there had to be someone else. Who knew?!
Um.
I suppose.
How everybody says "fuck" and "shit" all the time.  I used to be scared shitless I'd say "fuck" or "shit" in public, by accident.  Now everybody says "fuck" and "shit," "fuck" and "shit" all the time. Something very big must have happened while we were out of the country.
You don't know my mother-in-law, boy.
Thank God we found the fucking diamonds!
Can I have the Cadillac?
When I drive it, I feel like I'm in the middle of a great big wad of bubblegum.  I don't hear anything, I don't feel anything.  I figure somebody else is driving.  It's a bitch.
You told me.
You'd get this funny look in your eyes, and I'd say to myself, "Oh, Jesus--he's going to tell me what a retiarius is again."
Alice would be absolutely tear-ass.
I told you the uniform wouldn't help.
So, kid--how they hanging?  Or don't you say that to a little kid?
You're so low!  Look at that beautiful red meat.  You haven't touched it.
You know her for what she is now-- garbage.
I know you think that.
Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
I forgot my vacuum cleaner.
Selling vacuum cleaners isn't the best preparation you could have.
We got to get another pilot.
What went wrong?
I'm smarter than Looseleaf.
Sir?
Dr. Woodly.  I should make a little list.
And you've been roaming the streets while your mother is God-knows-where?
Man and boy.
Even this--"Herb Shuttle", you said?
College!
Excellent!
Oh hell.
As in "Death, where is thy sting?" He killed at least fifty men, wounded hundreds more.
Don't care for cold steel?  A knife is worse than a bullet?
We caught another Kraut alone in a back lane.  Your father choked him to death with a length of piano wire.  Your father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire.  That's nicer than a knife, isn't it--as long as you don't look at the face afterwards.  The face turns a curious shade of avocado.  I must ask the doctor why that is.  At any rate, we stole into the back of the inn, and, with the permission of the management, we poisoned the wine of six Krauts who were carousing there.
The name will live forever.  It was there that Harold Ryan slew the Beast of Yugoslavia.  Mhravitch.
It's rather a disappointment these days.  It isn't there any more.
He seems to think they are.  He told me that were.
You're a very good boy to respond that way.
Why don't you go to bed--son.
Tomorrow's another day. PAUL You know what my English literature teacher said about you?
Dad--
What kind of exercise?
Of course it is.  Is it loaded?
I don't know what I hope.  But I don't think you care what I hope, anyway.  You don't know me.  You don't know her, either.  I don't think you know anybody.  You talk to everybody just the same.
Eighteen--  and a half.
Sir?
How do you do?
Like hugging a lamp post.
This reunion isn't what I imagined it would be.
You know what I want?  I want you both to be friends.  I know you both, respect you both. You should be friends.
Harold!
He doesn't deserve this!  You don't know him.  It isn't fair!
And lots of orange juice--oceans of orange juice.
Honeymoon temporarily canceled.  The boy should still go out and exercise.  I have the impression he never gets any exercise.  He simply bloats himself with Fig Newtons and bakes his brains over steam radiators.
Cook, by God!  Cook!  You're the nigger now.
Such as?...
And no one's there now?
Why not?
Did you like it, dear?
I bought him a twenty-two yesterday--on the way home from Hamburger Heaven.  And where is the good doctor?  Have you two feathered a love nest somewhere?
An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink.  It put us in a haze--a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge.  We laughed, we sang, we snoozed.  When a bird called, we answered back. Every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried.  We had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach!  I sang "Oh Promise Me." Can you imagine? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to "Oh Promise Me"?  Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a B-36.  All the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup!  Never stopped drinking blue soup.  Blue soup all the time. We'd go out after food in that honey-colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender.
Beautiful, you say?  It wasn't life, it wasn't death--it wasn't anything!  Beautiful?  Seven years gone--  like that, like that!  Seven years of silliness and random dreams! Seven years of nothingness, when there could have been so much!
So he can kill you.  You hate your own life that much.  You beg for a hero to kill you.
The old heroes are going to have to get used to this, Harold--the new heroes who refuse to fight. They're trying to save the planet. There's no time for battle, no point to battle anymore.
I'm turning off the alarm.  I'm turning off everything.
But here you are inside, aren't you?
...Who?... Did she say how far apart the pains were?... When was that?... Oh dear.
Yes!  Yes!  The boy!  One boy!
Just her neighbor and doctor? That's all?
How was the emergency, Doctor? Profitable, I hope.
Tough luck.  You'll have to split the fee.
None.
Well now--what seems to be the trouble with the patient today?  A touch of malaria, perhaps?
Congratulations.  By crossing twenty-eight feet of cockroach- infested carpet, you've become the third white man ever to hear of it.
I thought she was a widow.
You intend to crack my eardrums with your voice?  Will I bleed from my every orifice?  Who will clean up this awful mess?
You're a son of a bitch.
I haven't told you, Harold, how comical I think you are.
You're in one hell of a jam.  You realize that?
Glands.  You're supposed to be happy when you die.  Call me comical again.
I love you!  Have a cigar!
I'm to be left behind--in primordial ooze?
This is going to become very physical.  Are you prepared for that?
You hope.
Don Quixote.
You're making a mistake.  Obsolete old carnivores like me are most dangerous when wounded.  You've wounded me.
Leave the rifle here.
I dunno, boy.
She married an accountant named Stanley Kestenbaum.
I'm only ten years old.
Aha!  Hello!  You're Mildred, right?
You were Harold Ryan's third wife. Right?
You want to join the Harold Ryan Fan Club?  Wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back?
Ach soooooooooo. MILDRED No grown woman is a fan of premature ejaculation.  Harold would come home trumpeting and roaring.  He would the kick the furniture with his boots, spit into corners and the fireplace.  He would make me presents of stuffed fish and helmets with holes in them. He would tell me that he had now earned the reward that only a woman could give him, and he'd tear off my clothes.  He would carry me into the bedroom, telling me to scream and kick my feet.  That was very important to him.  I did it.  I tried to be a good wife.  He told me to imagine a herd of stampeding water buffalo.  I couldn't do that, but I pretended I did.  It was all over--ten seconds after he'd said the word "buffalo." Then he'd zip up his pants, and go outside, and tell true war stories to the little kids.  Any little kids.
You bet I'll worry about it.  I said something wrong?
That goes double for me.
And this is my son, Paul.  He was only four years old when his father disappeared.
That's an interesting piece of news.
Not true.
You know she has no feet!  You want him to abandon his mother, who has no husband, who has no money of her own, who has no feet?
In a railroad accident many years ago.
Norbert was just beginning practice. A real man would have sold her to a catfood company, I suppose.  As far as that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother.
Is Norbert still here?
Then who flushed the toilet?
That's why I'm crying.
It came yesterday.  I haven't opened it yet.
Please--
All through the day I'm so confident.  That's why I'm such a good salesman, you know?  I have confidence, and I look like I have confidence, and that gives other people confidence.  People laugh sometimes when they find out I'm a vacuum cleaner salesman.  They stop laughing, though, when they find out I made forty-three thousand dollars last year.  I've got six other salesmen working under me, and what they all plug into is my confidence.  That's what charges them up.
I was captain of the wrestling team at Lehigh University.
I see.
Is he all right?
I figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another.
We've got to find him.  I want you to show me exactly where you saw him last.  And you stay here, Norbert, in case he comes home.  That's all he said--the thing about the key?
They made her so sleepy she couldn't work.
"War is not healthy for children and other living things." How lovely.
The wilder Paul is tonight, the calmer he'll be tomorrow.
After this explosion, I think, he'll be able to accept the fact that his mother is going to marry again.
I wish Paul luck.
I'd be dead by now if that were the case.
Every night, Penelope, for the past two years, I've made it a point to walk through the park at midnight.
To show myself how brave I am.  The issue's in doubt, you know--since I'm always for peace--
That's been said before.
Get out of here.
You fool, you fool.
Everything's going to be beautiful.
Hi kid.  Would you look what the car dragged in.
You've got to fight from time to time.
We only have two members so far, but it's growing all the time.
We aren't gonna arrest him for that...
There's a girl I want to ask you about.
What do you mean?
Who is it? That blond guy? Where is he? I'm going to talk to someone.
My name is Hope. This is Faith.  Charity's in back.
What do you think of this... ah, shade of blue, Mary.
Yeah. He's a nice guy. Don't lose him. Maybe we could tone down this stripe a bit. It's a little...
Are you the star of this picture?
I work with Ramada. We're doing some pictures together.
Are you Niki?
You making a feature?
Make it nine hundred. That was my best week.
When do we start?
I thought you were going to bed?
Of Joanne's?
You really shouldn't eat like that. All that sugar. It's not good for you.
Say what?
How important do you think sex is?
They were here?
What does that mean?  What does he do?
I can stop if you want.
Out of gratitude for being chosen. That's where Grace comes in. God first chooses you, then allows you, by Grace, to choose Him of your own free will.
I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into the life.
Andy.
As I was saying, I'll pick up the thread. There's a number of ways I can go. There's not much you can do here. Stay if you want. Maybe it'd be better if you went back home. Go through Kristen's personal stuff. Ask around, maybe she knew somebody out here.  Look, I do this a lot. I work at a minimum rate of $750.00 a week. It may seem like a lot of money to you, but it ain't. You could hire cheaper.
Have you ever seen any, ah, pornographic movies, Jake?
Yeah. You ever seen any of those?
They're legal now.
Oh, fuck off. You should stay where you belong.
You know, it's possible to buy anything on this earth. You can buy child whores, slaves. You can have people raped, killed...  One of the men who supposedly arranges such things is named Ratan. He usually isn't in this country.  How'd you hear about him?
Don't do anything more. I'll find out what I can.
What happened?
Um-hm. You got the five hundred?
Do you have a, ah, film called 'Slave of Love?'
It's a short film.
Well, Bill -- mind if I call you Bill?  Let me be frank. I've made a lot of money. I've got my own business in Detroit. Rivets. I make rivets and sell them to Fisher Body.  Well, rivets, you know, can get pretty boring after a while. When my business manager told me I should shelter some money, I thought I'd try this.
Jake.
Sounds all right.
I got a picture here. I want you to tell me where to find this woman. I been asking everybody. Nobody knows anything.
I'm staking out this beer bottle. Trying to find out if I'll finish it or it'll finish me.
I'm off that case. He fired me.
You know Granville's looking for you, Niki?
Granville's looking for you anyway.
Hey, piss-head, what brings you around?
I'm still in L.A., but I'm looking for Tod. I heard he was around.
Hello, I'm Candy Gulf.
Haven't we met before?
No.
Officer, I can explain.
Check.
I suppose they are in the truck. Are you going to take a lot of time with this?
Oh. Well, what is it exactly that you do?
Edith was just telling me about her job.
Of course, I've had to make some additions for the new models, but not as many as you might think. Once you have your basic set it's then only a question of variation.
Not <u>any</u> car. I like to keep a variety. I'm always looking for the new experience, like this one. I liked it.
Thank you, but it's an appointment. I really shouldn't miss it.
Me! No. Of course not.
Now I'll pump it up...  ... and you just turn the handles.  Okay. What do you smell?
Here we are, Harold. Oat straw tea and ginger pie.
I should like to change into a sunflower most of all. They are so <u>tall</u> and simple. And you, Harold, what flower would you like to be?
Why not?
He's never finished one yet. He has around him every kind of hand tool known to man, but the poor dear has difficulty staying awake.
The ice is melting.
Don't you think we should turn off the heat?
You are the wisest person I know.
Yes. I haven't lived.  I've died a few times.
But they have.
Don't you talk to me like that, you little foul mouth degenerate!  Really, sir, I thought that you at least...
Oh, you weren't scared.
Look at the stars.
Yes.
I was remembering how much this meant to me. It was after the war... I had nothing... except my life. How different I was then - and yet how the same.
Oh, Harold! What a fuss this is.  So unnecessary.
I suppose you think this is very funny, Harold.
Love? Love? What do you <u>know</u> about her? Where does she come from? Where did you meet her?
My mother spoke to my Uncle Victor. He's in the Army and he fixed it up.
Then why did you leave?
To strangle someone. Choke him. Squeeze out his life between your hands.
I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.
Boy, to think I could maybe make my own.
Tell me --  -- is that car parked all right?
It's different for us.
Oh, right. Daddy's died and gone to heaven, eh?
Daddy! Daddy! I love you! Help me!
Well, the sofa isn't often used for sleeping on...
And you're sure it was a woman?
What do you mean?
I'm scared.
Where am I?
What was it, kid? Smack? Angel dust? Don't tell me acid's back in fashion?
I thought Steve had talked to you?
What the hell are you asking me for? Tag it. Move it.
Look at them ugly suckers, Blue. One sheet of glass between them and us.
How am I ever gonna get a girl?? I drive around in a garbage truck
Nah -- he's taken care of.
Touched you five seconds. Laid three eggs.
That's all for you, Sammy.
harbinger of pestilence, seed of destruction --
You are a Catholic??
The freak in the gas mask --
Do you believe in hell?
Every time the media get a look at him, they come to me. I'm running out of lies, Trevor.
Your "guest" happens to be six foot five, bright red, and is government funded.
These freaks, Trevor, they give me the creeps. And I'm not the only one. You're up for review. You and your petting zoo.
A 16th century statue was destroyed. Saint Dionysius the Aeropagite.
Well, I won't be around forever, you know?
1958, the occult war finally ends when Adolf Hitler dies.
Got tired of me?
He gets fed six times a day. He's got a thing for cats. You'll be his nanny, his keeper, his best friend. He never goes out unsupervised --
Oh, Jesus!! Hellboy -- ?? Is real --
She's dead.
You will never fulfill your destiny. You will never understand the power inside you.
"One falls, two shall arise." So: you pop one, two come out. You kill two, you get four. You kill four, you're in trouble. We have to nail 'em all at once. And the eggs.
Helping you -- I just --
What took you so long?
What was that??
Myers, you're a talker. What's a good word -- a solid word for "need" --
Nah, sounds too "needy."
Well good n-
I admire him. He's a force of nature.
Strong.
What about you?
It's freezing, isn't it?
Hit me.
Just take it slowly.
That your daughter?
Many times.
Please. Get back into bed.
Kirsty. It's Frank. It's Uncle Frank.
Don't touch me. Or so help me --
Oh my God.
No. God no.
I'm hurting
My nerves... are beginning to work again.
I was bored. I'd done everything. I'd gone to the limits. There was nothing left to experience. At least nothing I could buy on earth.
Don't you care?
Kirsty.
What happened?
What's the problem?
How long since you were here?
Why didn't he want to sell it?
Not exactly modern.
You know we have to let Kirsty see this place, before we do anything to it. She'll love it.
No argument.
Larry!
You're NOT going to faint.
It's probably going to need stitches.
Would you excuse me? I think I'm going to go to bed.
I'll be O.K. Just leave me be a while.
Are you all right?
Huh?
What's wrong with you?
What are you drinking?
I try not to drink at lunch-time. Makes me sleepy in the afternoon. You like to keep a clear head, eh?  One soda, one whisky.  I do it anyway. No will-power. Got a busy afternoon?
No, not much.
This isn't the bedroom.
Oh Christ.
I thought you were going to stay with us for awhile?
It's not a gesture. I want to do this on my own. Come on, trust me a little will you?
Are you O.K.?
Yeah.
...maybe we should never have come back.
I guess.
She doesn't even want to leave the house.
It's like she's waiting for something.
I have to talk to you.
I'm afraid it's true.
You know I do know the way home.
All right.  No. That's nice.
Why don't you stay at Larry's house? There's plenty of room.
It's not what I heard.
If I make it through the day.
TURN IT OFF, BARRY.
But it's my new tape.  My Monday morning tape.  I made it last night just for today.
What did he ever do to you?
What did you tell her about the shop for?
"Thunder Road," Bruce Springsteen, from Born to Run. "Smells Like Teen Spirit," Nirvana, Nevermind.
"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --
I never thought I would say this, but can I go work now?
My band.
The band that found me and asked me to join.
They were fucking called that before I was in it, okay?  It wasn't my idea.
None.  Christ!
It was Jan, and it was a long time after--
What the fuck is that?
Barry, you're over thirty years old. You owe it to yourself and your friends and to your parents not to sing in a group called Sonic Death Monkey.
Oh really.  Well what about the first Jesus and Mary Chain?
Holy Shiite!  What the fuck's this?
It's a reference to a Chinese meal in Toronto and I think that there is a "The."  But I could be wrong.
He's got one!
Anna.
"Somebody's Gonna Die" by Blitz. "Bella Lugosi's Dead," Bauhaus. It's got that creepy Halloween feeling.
What are you talking about?
Oh.  Okay.
And the new label?  And the Kinky Wizards?
No, that's okay.  Really.
Are you all right?
I always hated this song.
Rob.
I will now sell four copies of Cats and Dogs by the Royal Trux.
Laura?  Are you okay?
Yeah, well, I've stopped all that now.
So shall we leave it at that then?
Are you coming home?
How can you like Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye?  It's like saying you support the Israelis and the Palestinians.
But don't you remember?
You used to care more about things like Marvin Gaye than you do now. When I first met you, and I made you that tape, you loved it.  You said -- and I quote -- "It was so good it made you ashamed of your record collection."
So you weren't interested in music at all?
What were the others?
Yeah.  Great.
Is it better?
I don't know.
Is that why you wanted to see me?
And anyway, I keep trying to tell you, that's not really the point, is it?  The point is we got ourselves into an awful mess, Rob...  Are you there?  What are you thinking?
I figured it was.  Where are you?
Are you still in love with me?
I don't want to.  Don't need to.  I love you.
Don't forget your CDs.
Okay, okay.  I get the picture.
I guess I am.
Are you alright?
Do you want me to be there?
You're soaking.
When are you going back?
You know, with Ray...
No, no.  It's not... are you still on the pill?
Was it like good sex or was it like bad sex?
Oh, c'mon, Laura.  Just say something. Lie, if you want.  It'd stop me asking you questions and it'd make me feel better.
Yeah, you're alright.  But you're certainly not happy.  So what happens if you get happy?  And yes I know that's the title of an Elvis Costello album, I use the reference deliberately to catch your attention. Should we split up because I'm used to you being miserable?  What happens if you, I don't know, start you're own record label, and it's a success? Time for a new girlfriend?
Where?
You did that deliberately.  You knew all along I'd like them.  It was a trick.
Yeah, and he said it's a good way to break out a record.  Especially for what he said, and I quote, "would be a highly anticipated event, locally." He helped me put out a press release.
They'll go on early.  Nobody will even be there yet and I told them they can't play for more than a half hour.
What are you going to talk to me about?
Very persuasive.
I mean, maybe you're right.  But were you really expecting me to say yes?
Rob here.
Actually, I'm fine.  I'm great. Last night I got to thinking, "you know what?  Maybe it is time to move on.  Maybe we're just not right for each other.  Or maybe we are.  But time will tell and at this point I'm going to be fine with whatever's meant to be." You know?
So the minister says nice things, and then, what, we all troop outside and they bury him?
Good.  'Cause I'm enjoying myself.
She just wanted to pick up some stuff. No big thing.  A relief, actually.
You share a place with T-Bone?
You haven't even seen it!
For now.  But I wouldn't be if I thought this was the end of the evening.
I'd like it if you could stay the night.
Yeah?
So so.  Up and down.
How would I know?  Gone.  Girlfriend. Leave.  Not say where gone.  Laura move out.
I knew this would happen.  What are you going to do Rob?
And after that?
I knew this was going to happen.
But you must have --
Look.  Can I pay you properly?  You don't have to tell him what you got. Send him forty-five bucks and blow the rest.  Give it to charity.  Or something.
Look... I... I'm sorry.  I don't want to be any part of this.
That's why I'm trying to compromise. What about fifteen-hundred?  They're worth five times that.
Eleven-hundred.  That's my lowest offer.
With eleven hundred he could come home, and that's the last thing I want.
We saw this ad in the personals for two swingers lookin' for a Renaissance fair.
Well, the cream of society awaits.  If you're ever in the neighborhood...
He was unsual.
No.
Taupin, Richard Marshall.  Born March 16, 1945 in Church Hill, Maryland.  Received first driver permit 1967 in Philadelphia.
Good reflexes.
Someone beat you.
Grave robbers?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Who is he?
He called you "MacLeod".
He was innocent.
I'm a historian, Mr. Taupin. Only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face.
He sees me as a threat.
No.  I had to talk to you.
You're wrong.
Here, try this.  I suppose they're still making women the same as back then.
My life has been chock full of people with complications and weak- nesses.  I can't stand it.  But you're different.  It's in your hands.  A clarity.
Sometimes innocents become involved.
But you're known so much. History I'll only read about.
Gettysburg's an hour's drive at most.  You should be back by nightfall.
Get out.
The emptyness.  The years and years of void.  Nothingness.  Bordered only by the quest for ultimate nothingness. Who would have guessed?
Forget it.
But there's more.  Wednesday someone played javelin with the cemetary curator in Felton, Delaware.  Some locals spotted two cars with D.C. plates and surprise surprise, they turn out to be registered to our own Brenna Cartwright and the ever popular Richard Taupin.
I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did.
I don't believe him.
Requiem acer'nam donaei-
-Et lux perpetua-
When I was a boy a cart driven by a drunken fool crushed me.  All thought I would die or be maimed for life.  But I healed quickly. And like you I paid the price for being different.
Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?
What is to become of me?  Am I to wander the Earth forever like a ghost?
Why?
You have not been fully trained. But you will learn.  And you will be good, I can feel that.  You have apt- itude.  This is why our friend is so concerned.
This power is divided amongst you, me, and others like cuts in a pie. But the cuts are not equal.  Some, like you and he, have more.  Much more.
Live?  In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel.
Some think not.
There's rumor in the village. Some call it magic.
State of grace and all that.
Finish your prayers?
Wait.  I think we understand each other.
Don't threaten me, Private.
Do not turn your back on me.
Your grandfather wore that in his service to the King, and I to fight for the Duke.
Fish are creatures of habit.  They like their food where they're used to it.  At the top, hiding in old leaves.
I want people in here to check over every piece of this stuff.
Any other I.D.s come up?
Round up who you can and put them on standby.
_Answer_ me.
Had a great swing with his blade. For a Pope.
I knew his great-grandfather.
Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have.  All else is just marking time.  You're marking time.
The pressure only comes when you let the taste slip into your mouth.
Run!
What's the point?
What's the point!  You have me, finish it!
We have some unfinished business.
This your present address?
Mr.-  Taupin, what were you doing in that alley?
Do you know what this is?
All I need is time.
You're one of William's kids, huh?
Can't you say 'hello' to a fellow?
Nothing -- ah -- detrimental, I hope.
I'd like to spoil him just once. Sure you don't want me to go in with you?
You know, Hildy, he's not a bad fellow.
If anybody had told me I'd be sitting at lunch with him -- but he swept me right off my feet.
Say, what's happened to Burns? He looks sunk, doesn't he?
But I don't gamble, Hilda!
That's right here. Gee, it was lucky your telling me about that old newspaper superstition.
Did you finish the interview?
I waited and waited and then I had an idea and wired Albany to send me a hundred dollars so I could get out on bail...  I don't know what they'll think -- they sent it to the police station!
Just a second, Walter. Here, Bruce, here's the check... And, oh, Bruce, here's your wallet. I got it back.
Mr. Burns --
You're Bruce Baldwin?
This is a pleasure, Mr. Baldwin, and I'm sorry about the mistake.
Oh, I thought there was something funny... You see, Bruce, you don't mind if I call you Bruce, do you? After all, we're practically related --
You see, my wife -- I mean, your wife -- that is, I mean Hildy -- had led me to expect that she was marrying a much older man.
But I see, she didn't mean old in years. You always carry an umbrella, Bruce?
Mighty nice little town, Albany. They've got the State Capitol there, you know.
Just what is the lowdown on Williams?
Don't want to forget this, you know. Might start to rain again.
Well, anyway, I know Hildy's getting a good man.
Well, I got to get back. You can find your way out, can't you?
Hildy!
And I'll take that certified check, too. I've decided I can handle things around here...
No? Well --  Johnson, you're under arrest.  You, too, Burns.
I'll show you what I'm doing. Burns, you're guilty of obstructing justice and so is the Morning Post. I'm going to see that the Post is fined ten thousand dollars for this.
Save that for the Tribune.
Was it my fault? Did I know that coal mine was going to have another cave-in? I meant to be with you on our honeymoon, Hildy -- honest I did.
What do you mean by that?
Sweeney! You can't do that to me! Not today, of all days! Jumping Jehosophat! Oh, no, Sweeney... Well, I suppose so... All right. If you have to, you have to.  How do you like that? Everything happens to me -- with 365 days in the year -- this has to be the day.
There's nobody else on the paper who can write! This'll break me, unless --  Hildy!
It'll bring us together again, Hildy -- just the way we used to be.
Don't mock, Hildy, this is bigger than anything that's happened to us. Don't do it for me! Do it for the paper.
Great grief! What's that other paper going to give you?
I tried to tell you right away but you started reminiscing. I'm getting married, Walter, and also getting as far away from the newspaper business as I can get! I'm through.
Well, I can, and I love it! He forgets the office when he's with me. He doesn't treat me like an errand-boy -- he treats me like a woman.
Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do any good.
You said it.
The colored vote happens to be very important to the Mayor of this town.
Now you're talking!
What tricks would I pull?
Exclusive? That's great.
Walter! D-did you see --  -- that?
We're going to take him over to my private office.  Where's our phone?
Get the lead out of your typewriter and start pounding out a load, will you? Snap into it!
For Pete's sake, Hildy, they're waiting for the rest of that story!
Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets.
Where's Mrs. Baldwin?
Lafayette two-one-hundred.
Oh, I see. I beg your pardon.
Hildy, you just can't leave me out on a limb now. It -- it wouldn't be cricket!
Wait a minute!  Let go there!
We've certainly been in some swell jams.
We sure did, but we had to go in hiding for a week.
Bruce is making the nine o'clock train. I told him you'd be on it -- unless you want to write this story yourself.
He's going to have you the rest of his life, Hildy. Can't you give me another hour?
Flip a coin.
Hildy!
Then why are you doing it?
What do you mean? Bruce'll be waiting for you in Albany.
Where'd you wire him?
That's what makes it romantic. Every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is, and vice versa. But us -- you never know where I am and I'm not sure where you are. That's Romance!
What's the good of arguing about something that probably doesn't exist? Look, Hildy, I'm proposing to you. What do you say?
How about Bruce's?
Down Western Avenue. We were going sixty-five miles an hour. You know what I mean?
Butter-fingers! I give you an old lady to take somewhere, and you hand her over to the cops!
Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.
You stay here. I'll find out everything.
Who do you want?
And that means Earl Williams dies tomorrow morning and makes a sucker out of us!
Say, isn't this your twenty dollars?
The newspapers! Sheriff, they're the scum of modern civilization.
So -- now I say to you: 'Earl Williams, you are under arrest!' and you point your gun at me.
Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's desk.
A fine bunch of reporters. Biggest story in two years and they're too lazy to go after it.
That must be the tenth alienist they've had on Williams. Even if he wasn't crazy before, he would be after ten of those babies got through psychoanalyzing him.  Gimme the desk.
She says she's gonna write fiction.
You guys wanna play some more poker?
Goodbye, Yonson.
We know what you're up to.
Gus, this --
Oh, nothing much. Just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself. If you don't want me to run it --
What went off?
After all I've done for you --
Just one second --
Pure politics!
And you can tell 'em as an afterthought that I want your resignation now!
Hold your horses -- will you, Olsen? Hurry up, Fred!
All right. Tell 'em to shoot to kill.
Take those handcuffs off our friends, Pete. That wasn't at all necessary.
I won't.
Got you, Williams!
All right. You can't. But tomorrow the Post will run the story of that roulette game on 43rd Street that your brother-in-law runs. And we'll print that you get five hundred a month for forgetting about it!
You can let him out on bail, can't you?
Oh, I ain't doing that any more. I'm retired. I'm one of you fellas now -- a newspaper man.
I'm telling you. Can you imagine bumping into a load of cops?! They come rollin' out like oranges!
Search me! When I come to I was running down Thirty-fifth Street.
Nobody's going to rush me into anything!  You keep away from me! 
Well, anyhow, I won't be covering stuff like this any more.
Any news?
I don't know why you boys are so good to me.
Have you got my dough?
Kings and sixes.
Any dope yet on how he got out?
Mother!
Stop screaming, Mollie or we're sunk. I'm trying to think of something before those reporters get back.
They'll get him! They'll get him!
They were all standing around when he wrote it. It was after they got back from fishing.
Get out of here!
Baldwin -- his name is.
What's he want?
What's that?
Never let a rat creep up on you.
You miserable little tripe-hound. I'm the one who should be fed up, sacrificing my last sup of black market petrol to take you to school.
It's true.
You want to join our gang?
He's never going to come back. He's gone off to be a soldier and Mummy doesn't even know.
You couldn't.
I suppose they're still learning, that's why they keep moving about.
Who with?
You're the biggest fibber.
Can't we just see the end?
Crocodiles! Aah!
Now, the googly looks like a leg break, but it's really an off break. Got it? Like this.
Wow!
Who pays for them?
Take it away. I know your husband's been away a long time, but....
Boy, that was some air-raid.
Could you seal it over with hot pitch, Clive? Caulk it like the hull of a ship.
And Jim.
Consider Grace, the kids. I love them like my own. And you.
You're a mug, Clive. We did our bit in the Last Lot.
Why not?
Here's to music. And absent friends.
No Turks.
We don't know anything about it
Taste it. Why don't you taste it?
You mean they let you go through the officer training course and then said you were too old for a commission?
It seems to have survived.
I'm so glad you could come. Here we are, all together again.
Yeah, I know where that is, it's right by my house. It's Dr. Satan's tree. I can show ya.
Cone.
What about the tree?
So, you live here alone... I mean with just your brother?
Um, yeah sure, I guess.
Mmmmm, this is tasty.
That's not something to joke about.
Wondering what?
Take that, you fucking slut!  Fucking redneck whore!
Why? You gonna do something about it?
Keep the change and get yourself a new name.
Come on, bro. Let's go.
You mean John Wayne?
She's pretty cute.
Hold on, I've heard this before... but I can't remember the end.
I'll pump the gas. Go inside and see if it's worth thinking about.
Come on, we need something like this. It could be the real deal. It's too far out of the way to come back to.
That reminds me of a film I saw once of a guy who got out of his car at Lion Country Safari to take a picture of a lion cub and got eaten by the lions.
OK, let's relax. I'll check it, maybe I'm wrong. Don't everybody freak out just yet.
Don't look back, just get in the car.
We'll need pictures of the inside too.
Well, don't even think about playing the good samaritan, there's way too many psychos wandering loose these days.
Should we stop?
Well, I got some bad news and some bad news.
Fine. I'll go straight.
How much is a person supposed to stand?
Well, I'll try but I don't know nothing 'bout nobody. I'm a guy who likes to mind his own business, if ya get what I'm saying.
And...
Goddamn.
Yeah, now there's the perfect woman.
Aw, come on. It will be fun.
Fuck, it's freezing.
Thank you.
What are you laughing at?
I can't... I can't move my arms. I hurt so much.
That was good babe, just keep doing that.
Hello...  ...hey Denise... what, what's wrong, did you break down?
Too late. You're in for life, let's move it out Private Shutterbug.
Aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute.  ...and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can Mona Lisa?
God, I hate falling asleep in the afternoon. Now I'll be up all night...  ...ugh, my back is killing me.
What'd we here, Georgie?
God damn.
Open up the trunk.
I've been meaning to ask you, Mrs... Ummmm.
Hold on, hold on! Everybody calm down! It's the tow truck guy.
OK lassies, I think it's time you get to gripping reality.
This is way too fucked up for words.
I'm with Denise, can't we just walk to someplace, this is getting fucking stupid.
Oh, I get it... I guess you think you're too good for the simple pleasures of Halloween.
Where's Bill?
Behold... The Fish-Boy!
Well hello, officer.
Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it kind of looks like rain, don't ya think?
Please, could I please come in and talk to you for a minute? Maybe you could take a better look at the picture... might stir up something.
I'm the one who brings the devil's brandy... 
Hey.
Local girl, Karen Murphy, been missing for a couple months, figured for a runaway.
You know, his senses start tingling... when he was approaching danger and shit.
Hulk was dumb as shit.
Over.
Harold! Tell the boy again.
I don't know why you didn't tell me about this.
Well, don't jump down my throat. I'm just trying to help.
Let's go eat, I'm starved.
Only three shocks. A chimp takes fifteen. This is going to be tres simple, no, Gabrielle?
No. Don't be. I really enjoy hearing that. You're a terrific assistant.
Coincidence, yes?  And how is our son?
I am sleepy.
Really? I always think myself so ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A wallflower.
You were wonderful today, darling. Such authority with the ape-man boy. It made me so hot for you.
The way you are taming him, it sends chills down my girlish spine and... everywhere else, too.
What?
Well?
Anyway. Come already to the point.
So we've got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements, my wonderful men.
Lila?
I know. And that's great. But it would be great in a better way, not a better way but a different way, if I could find him and bring him back.
A little resistance would be nice, damn it.
He's dead.
No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice I need to make. In my world we have something called penance. It's another abstraction, but I had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. It doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. See, I could never be free again anyway, so I might as well be in jail.
I don't get that. Is that sexual?
Handsome, thirties, psychologist...
My brother says the guy's a thirty- five year old virgin, so maybe he won't know how women usually feel. Plus he's got bad eyesight, almost legally blind, which is helpful in this situation. Plus he's got an extremely small penis, of which he is "mortifyingly ashamed", so chances are he'll be so grateful for any non- judgmental attention, that he'll be yours forever.
No maid service! For God's sake, can't you read the fucking "do not disturb" sign on the fucking doorknob?
Go the fuck away, Rosie.
Your brother should have his license revoked.
I don't know, honey. I don't know. Maybe he just didn't want to get involved.
Uh, tie them up, Rosie. If you will.
I'm going to miss you.
I love that you said that. It makes me feel a bit lighter. I've been rather heavy lately. Thinking about my childhood. Realizing how much a product I am of my upbringing.  I've been seeing someone. A therapist.
No no. I'm a psychologist, but I do research. I'm a behaviorist. I work with animals. Mice at the moment.
Um-mmm. Oh Nathan, this salad is delish...
Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Nathan. I never really learned those things.
Actually, Mother and Father, you look very, very old. You look terrible.
I was simply attempting to keep the evening light. You know that I feel similarly to you about nature.
We could call it "Quit Bugging Me, Sunny."  Get it? Sunny. S-u-n-n-y.
I don't know. Something.
Feral? Don't touch him! He might be diseased! He might... My God, rabies!
Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated?
It's hormonal, Nathan. I can't help it. I'm sorry.
So, how's it going today?
Are you seeing somebody else, Nathan? I just have to know.
Really?
How's work?
Oh, baby. I'm sorry. Can't you hire somebody else?
Yes! And I want to help. You won't have to pay me, and I was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing anyway.
You just have to control it. We're not apes.
How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?
Shut up! Yeah, this is Lila, cunt. And don't let the hirsutism fool you. I know more about being a woman, and more about the black hearts of men than you, in your pretty little powdered, bullshit fantasy world, can ever imagine. I know the darkness and cruelty of nature, sweetie pie.
Aha! Finally. I've covered almost the entire seaboard and parts of eastern Ohio.
Shut up!  I gave you... life. I created you in my image, Puff. I took you from this primordial ooze and brought you into the world of culture and art and manners. And this is how you repay me? By heading back to the ooze first chance you get? I should leave you here with Lila the ape woman. It would serve you right, you ungrateful piece of crap. But I'm not going to. You're too valuable to me. Totally selfish of me. You serve my purpose. But if you had any smarts you would realize that I serve your purpose as well. Life is so much more delightful when lived in a silk suit.
Oh boy!
Good. Remember, when in doubt: Don't ever do what you really want to do.
And of course to you, my sweet, for your... moral support.
No, why?
It's a pleasure to meet you, mother. But I'm an ape like dad was...  And I have to go back into the woods now... forever.
Yes.
Stay with this kid. He's a loser.
Okay?
Poker's not your game.
Wait a minute. Maybe I can help you.
For me.
How much you think you're worth these days? I'm puttin' up the money, I'm puttin' up the time. For that I get seventy-five per cent return on my money -- if you win.
Look, you wanna hustle pool, don't you? This game isn't like football. Nobody pays you for yardage. When you hustle you keep score real simple. The end of the game you count up your money. That's how you find out who's best. That's the only way.
I'm already rich. But I like action. That's one thing I think you're good for is action. Besides, like I say... you got talent.
Hey, wait.  What are you gonna do about the money?
Man named Turk Baker?
Everybody who can hurt me, everybody who can help me. It pays.
Sign up.
Sarah Packard... Bert Gordon.
James Findley is a very rich man. Grandfather left him twenty per cent of a tobacco company.
Hey, Bert. Wait a minute!
Fifty per cent?
We really stuck the knife in her, didn't we, Bert?
Who's he?
You name it, we shoot it.
Yeah, that's right.
Just tell me where I can find him, friend.
You know what I mean. You couldn't make that shot again in a million years.
How do you feel?
Ah, get with it, will ya, Charlie?
What are you trying to do, Eddie? You beat him. You beat him bad. You wanna kill yourself?
What kind of life have you got here? Scufflin' around the small rooms, picking up eight, ten bucks a day?
C'mon, c'mon, just give me the money.
Yeah, to play Fats again.
No, no more for me.
What time?
I thought we came here to play pool.
Beautiful shot, Felson. Beautiful. You've played billiards before, Mr. Felson. Ah, you gentlemen sure you don't care for a drink?
Like to raise the stakes, Mr. Felson?
There it is. I'm broke.
Here.  Been an interestin' evening.
Charles, will you call a cab for these gentlemen, please.  I'd show you to the door, but I...
You sure you don't want to quit, friend?
Okay, friend. You're on.
You better not miss, friend.
How long have you been waiting?
Yours.
Do you always ask so many questions?
You talk kind of funny, but I like it.
I don't know. Whatever you like it to be.
I could always get us a bottle.
Why did you do that?
How did you know my name was Sarah?
You know, I've been living here for almost three years. Now in three days it seems as if I know everybody. When I pass people on the street I want to stop and say, "Listen, I got a fella."
Eddie, where do you go when you go out?
I'm hungry.
What did all this stuff cost you?
No, c'mon, I wanna know. I wanna keep score.
You told Charlie to lay down and die. Will you say that to me too?  What happens, Eddie?
Well, he owns things.
Well, what else does?
A week? A year?
Where's Bert?
Is that a fact?
Where do you come from?
Do you like to gamble, Eddie? Gamble money on pool games?
I quit, Eddie. I can't beat you. Willie, give him the stakes.  You got yourself a pool player.
It is not arguing to speak the truth.
Are you all right?
When you're here, in the city, where do you live?
Was this -- "beautiful?"  Before?
I don't know.
Yes.
Emma...
You have to go.  He'll never stop. Leave this place.  Find another.
That sounds charming.  What are you planning to do tomorrow?
It's never gonna be done.  You love puttering out there too much.
Need some gas?
What's that, Dad?
Is the hill ours too?
A meteorite, Dad, look!
Which one's that?  The dull, red one.
Well, son?  Should we call it a night?  I for one have had a long day.
Jim -- what's wrong?!
Are you sure you saw that?  In the rain -- it may have <u>looked</u> like it changed shape --
Are you all right, Dad?
I lost it.  It's kind of muddy out there.
I had an awful dream.
... And then everything blew up. And then I woke up.
It was so real, Dad.
What happened to you?  Who was that?
I'm home now.
What's wrong, Ellen?
Yes, I do, Mr. Gardner.
Mr. Gardner, I --
Why not?  Moving is hard for anybody.  Was it hard for you to leave all your friends?
How did it get Mrs. McKeltch?
What would you think if somebody told you a story like this?
Do you know how to follow a map?
Damn.
What do you think he saw?  Could it have been something from the air base?
Mom.  I gotta talk to you.
It's all this moving from place to place.  We're never settled.  I'm having nightmares myself.
What's the story on Jimmy Gardner?
What do you want?
This is not the time or the place to have this same old discussion.
You're being paranoid.
David? How'd you get this number?
What do you want me to do?
Moishe Martinsburg, Mr. President.
I don't know how you put up with him.
Yes, because the analog signal has a definite sequential digital patterns embedded within it. When I find the exact binary sequence and I apply a phase reversed signal to that calculated spectra analyzer I built you last Christmas, we should be able to block out the overlay completely...
Strange thing is, if my calculations are right it'll be gone in approximately seven hours anyway. The signal reduces itself every time it recycles. Eventually it will disappear. Are you listening?
Okay, why did I just send my family to Atlanta?
What are you waiting? My social security will expire, you'll still be sitting there.
You think they don't know what you know? Believe me, they know. She works for the President. They know everything.
It's Air Force One for crying out loud. Still he gets sick?
Dad, please...
Pops, you're a genius!
Thanks, Pops.
What're you doing?
General Grey, co-ordinate with Atlantic Command. Tell them they have twenty five minutes to get as many people out of the cities as they can.
Where's it headed?
Do not engage until we've confirmed the package has been delivered.
How do you know?
You're late.
That is an affirmative. I have victory dance. Mmmmmmm.
Jimmy, kick it! They're gaining.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
I'm not leaving.
Can they be killed?
Yes.
Marcus!  I did it!
Dad?
Venice, Italy!
That doesn't look much like a library.
Yes. Now we know.
Indy... Indy, you must hurry!! Come quickly!
Marcus!
The Word of God...
Care to wet your whistle, Marcus?
Are you expected?
We've hit a snag. Our project leader has vanished. Along with all his research. Uh, we received a cable from his colleague, Doctor Schneider, who has no idea of his whereabouts or what's become of him.  I want you to pick up the trail where he left off. Find the man and you will find the Grail.
Impossible? What do you say, Jones? Ready to go down in history?
Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth Century.
What's that?
How did you get here?
All I have to do is squeeze.
Dad!
Oh, it breaks the heart.
No! Dad, get your stuff. We've got to get out of here.
Dad, they come in through the doors.
Humpf -- so I was wrong this time. But by God, I wasn't wrong when I mailed you my Diary. You obviously got it.
You didn't, did you?  You didn't bring it, did you?
How did you she was a Nazi?
Ooooh... I like the Austrian way better.
The floor's on fire! See?!
This is intolerable!
Stop!
Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge.
Three devices of such lethal cunning.
Oh, yes. But I found the clues that will safely take us through, in the Chronicles of St. Anselm.
Marcus would agree with me.
I didn't know you could fly a plane.
This is intolerable!
Junior, give me your other hand! I can't hold on!!
You're strangely dressed... for a knight.
Why are you trying to kill us?
Captain Blumburtt and his troops are here to check up on the "natives".
Thank God all that mumbo jumbo rubbish is disappearing.
You're hanging on better here than you did in America.
Rather bizarre menu, wouldn't you say?
Then she must have run out of the room and you found her.
Jones isn't in his room. Miss Scott -- my troops are leaving at dawn if you want us to escort you to Delhi --
What?
Hard to believe, isn't it...?
The newspapers exaggerated the incident.
You never told me you spoke my language, Dr. Jones.
So, it is true, Dr. Jones? You found Nurhachi?
What you look at, Indy?
He was afraid of you. He knows a tough guy when he sees one.
This is Nainsukh -- from the village. They bring him here to dig in the mines.
Let up on the brake!
No. They are here -- somewhere. A century ago when the British raided this temple and butchered my people, a loyal priest hid the last two stones down here in the catacombs.
They dig for the gems to support our cause. They also search for the last two stones. Soon we will have all five Sankara Stones and the Thuggees will be all powerful!
Look out, damn it, I need that antidote!
What'd he say?
Hey, Willie -- I think you better get out now.
Listen, Willie. Do exactly what I tell you now.
Okay, I want you to lift your hand -- and pet the snake.
Thanks for nothing! I hate snakes!
He's afraid of something.
You're dying to come into my room, aren't you?
We'll see who gives in first -- I'll leave my door open.
No -- don't you see -- crawling --
WILLIE?!
GET US OUT! Willie, shut up and listen! There's got to be a fulcrum release! Look around!
Oh my God! He ripped out his -- he killed him!
Let's go! Let's get out of here!
What?
So now they believe me.
What're we going to do?!
Let her go! Our only chance is outrunning them!
Anymore ideas...?
The last Sankara Stone.
I get it!
Give me your hat...
Where are you,...Al?
...reporting....him... ventriloquism...On a bus
Who was it?
Your name is Al...
You're in my head, you can talk to me and hear what I say, but you can't see anything.
I told you, my name is Al.
What for?
You're not crazy.
Yeah JOE Why there's a little man in my head?
You'll be alive.
What do I do?
Get your breathing down. You sound like a cement mixer.
Now what.
Like the guys that attacked us.
Gone where?
I'm back.
What about money?
The beach?
Eating sushi?
I don't want to eat it.
Now lie down somewhere quiet and rest, I'll be back in a while.
Al, are you doing anything in there?
Beautiful!
This must be business, there's nothing else here.
She's...pretty fast.
What did that cost?
They both look good to me.
You got a better idea, you tell me. Other than her, there's no one here I know.
Joe, be careful!
They're all in it.
Voice stress analyzer.
Some agent you are.
What are you doing? Wait a minute. Lets think this through.
He was with Gruner!
I don't trust her.
It's him.
You sure this will work?
What was it? What'd I say?
Left...The one with the red dot.
It's in the watch. He lead us on that chase while Dieter brought the chip into Hong Kong.
Are you alright?
There's a lot you don't know.
This may hurt.
Be quiet.
Gimme a minute.
She works for them.
You were the one who was always suspicious of her!
She is beautiful.
I don't know how we're gonna get out of this, but we will, somehow.
What are you doing?
I've got twenty hours left. I could die in here. And you're falling in love.
What kind of a deal?
I knew you were trouble.
I knew he was following us. He diverted attention, exposed Ryuji's trap..
Impossible.
You have nothing...
What Job?
Who is your friend?
That crazy guy?
Your memory.
You may not remember things.
Joe.
What did you say?
What do you do about what?
Dinner...tonight.
And you?
You again.
...Ummm, you really work for the foreign service?
Who do you work for?
No. Ryuji just hires us.
To organize things. Meetings and travel...Whenever they come here, I handle details.
Why did you stay with me?
Who else is interested in me?
What did you tell them?
You work for Ryuji?
Were you working for him last night?
You're leaving.
Hiroshima.
What's Gruner like?
This boat doesn't go anywhere. Just toots around the Inland Sea.
Now what?
What?
So do I.
Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him.
What happened?
Looks like they can. What did they do?
Don't worry.
Kiss her you fool.
I can't. He didn't do anything. Thanks to you.
I have a seat. I've had it since nine.
It's alright.
Yes.
Right there.
The other working.
It will.
It'l take months.
What's new?
Yeah? What for?
Did you see somebody or did you hear them?
Mom.
Push it.
It's a smear campaign, Charlie.
What was that about?
Do you want more rice?
CBS does not do that. And, you're questioning our journalistic integrity?!
You're exaggerating!
I'm staying right here. Doing my job. Fighting to get my show on the air. You don't like it? Hey, I'll tell you what... fire my ass...
What the hell are you doing?
The New York Times ran a blow by blow of what we talked about behind closed doors! You fucked us!
That computer has everything...
Come again?
Is CBS corporate telling CBS News do not go to air with this story?
Hi, baby.
Hello?
Why did you take your stuff from the office?
I don't understand.
Why? Who said?
There's a severance agreement... It includes cash payouts over time and continuing medical coverage...  Sure you don't need anything?
Please don't wash your hands in the sink.
Oh, someone took a poll? "Are all things Canadian boring...?"
...no... this looks like a table of temperatures... Who's this from?
What?!
What are you and Mike going to do?
"I'm Lowell Bergman, I'm from '60 Minutes.'" You know, you take the "60 Minutes" out of that sentence, nobody returns your phone call. Maybe Wigand's right. Maybe I'm hooked. What am I hooked on? The rush? "60 Minutes"? What the hell for? Infotainment. It's so fucking useless, all of it.
Is it too late?
Oh, my God.
Yeah, I'm here.
No shit.
Thank you for saying that...
Lowell.
Yeah, that's right.
How have you liked your stay?
Who's that?
How do you like your coffee? Black?
I know what I have to know.
How much would I get paid?
Mrs. Wigand, how do you do?
This is my house... In front of my wife, my kids?! What business do we have?
Talk to me outside the zone of your agreement?
Seven dwarfs?
...okay.
Is that why you became a journalist? Then you get to ask all the questions?
My father was a mechanical engineer... most ingenious man I ever knew.
I believe that? Yes, I believe that.
I'm going to be a witness for them in their litigation. So I'm going to fly to Pascagoula to give a deposition...
I heard about the Kentucky gag order...
Alright... the ABC Telemarketing Company?
ABC Telemarketing Company.
You fought for me...?!  ...you manipulated me... into where I am now... staring at the Brown & Williamson Building. It's all dark. Except the 10th floor! That's the legal department. That's where they fuck with my life!
You try and have a good time.
I think I need to call the police. He won't respond...
What about now?
Alright, now listen to me. I want you -- I want you to tell him, in these words: get on the fucking phone...!
Hold on a minute, Lowell...  ...somebody... may be following me. I don't know. They came on the property...
What are you talking about?
I heard you. But I got to arrange a legal defense first. I got to get you to testify in court, get it on public record.
You heard Mr. Sandefur say before Congress that he believed nicotine was not addictive...?
All of us did. There was this whole line of people... whole line of CEOs up there all swearing.
A delivery device for nicotine. Put it in your mouth, light it up, and you're gonna get your fix...
Object to the form of the question!
Object!
And, he gets out there and he has five strokes on us. He has more concentration than anybody I've ever met. It's spooky how he can concentrate.
Is that a threat?
Yes. Your husband did show remarkable foresight in taking those pictures. And, yes, absent a swimming pool, the presence of the pool man would appear to be suspicious. But Bonnie, who is the real victim here? Let me suggest the following. Your husband, who on a prior occasion slapped you -- beat you --
Your husband, who has beaten you -- repeatedly --
Miles, how nice of you to see us -- may I introduce Howard D. Doyle of Doyle Oil.
Muh -- Well, uh -- Huh?
I am here representing Mr. Dumbarton, on a... matter of some delicacy.
Excuse me?
No. I have the ring. Was I supposed to have a pre-nup?
I'm sorry to hear that. But you weren't close, were you?
I begged you to have a baby!
It sounded like a bell.
How nice.
Do you have a hard heart, Marylin.
Ruth says you've been too successful, that you're bored, complacent, and you're on your way down.
I'll have the tournedos of beef. And the lady will have the same?  I assume you're a carnivore.
No.
Yes. I loved my husband, Rex.
Getting married.
Yes. He's a diamond in the rough. And I have a feeling that someday soon you'll be taking that diamond and leaving the rough.
I am thrilled for you, but tell me this... How'd you get Howard to do it? I've addressed enough juries to appreciate the power of suggestion, but it seemed like he thought it was his own idea.
Well, when this goes south -- promise you'll have dinner with me?
It has bones. Be sure to swallow one.
I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...?
Okay. Should I stop at Starbucks and pick up a blended for --
Is that you?
Hmmm...
She never particularly cared for me.
I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen to me. I'm sure you have a very fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm depressing.
I want to be your -- your wife.
You do?
I don't have a ring!
Here's my card. Spend as much as you want. We get mileage.
Exactly. And then -- maybe -- not right away -- There's a room right off the bedroom -- It would be perfect for a nursery.  It's a walk in humidor right now -- but if I took out the refrigeration unit --
You don't like me?
I don't believe you have "things."
I want to nail you ass.
Drop the bogus forgery charge and I'll forget about your generous friends slash clients.
Hello?
Miles? Miles! Where have you been? I've been trying to get in touch.
Just listen to me. I'm sorry, Miles. It's true that my initial intention was to...
It's a no go, Joe.
Are you forgetting about the Atcheson, Topeka and the Santa Fe?
Have you been taking your digestive enzymes?
I was devastated. Of course.
Is this a lover?
Forgery and Fraud?
He told me to -- he said he wanted me to --
She's a legend. Didn't she do Kravis or a Pearlman? She definitely did a Factor.
Miles Massey.
Who's she?
Maybe.
What?
Yes, I know Howard Doyle.
Mr. Massey --
What?!
My client has ruled that out.
When I first met Marylin -- Well, we were crazy about each other. Not emotionally, of course. We just couldn't keep our hands off each other.
Time marches on. Ardor cools.
Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves. Well, let me ask you this: what kind of settlement do you seek? What are, for you, the parameters of the possible?
I think that went as well as could be expected.
And she had private investigators assisting her.
In anticipation of making you sick.
What the hell is wrong with you?
I'm sorry I'm late. I was having lunch with Ruth Rabinow's assistant. Guess what? Marylin Rexroth is divorced!
Extinguish?
Now, Mrs. Banderas. What is your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth.
Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?
Let me tell you something about Patty.
George was so impressed he hired him when he divorced his second.
Here you are.  Do you mind if I ask you something frankly?  Do you love my daughter?
You'll have a corpse on your hands! That what You'll have. I won't eat a thing while I'm on this boat.
You talk as if he were a gigolo—or something.
Ellie—
I knocked several times.
Well, if it's as serious as all that—we'll move heaven and earth to—
I'd like to have a talk with him.
Peter Warne! 
Looks like that was his only interest in me. The reward.
You talk as if—
Me? Forget it, son.  I got millions.
No, thanks. We're not hungry.
Oh, yeah?
Driver!
Oh, my heavens! It's gone!
What happened?
No, I've got that, all right. But my money. All I have here is four dollars. I've got to get to New York with it.
Why, no—I—  Yes . . . I guess I will.
Just a spoiled brat of a rich man. You and Westley'll make an ideal team.
If you promise not to snap my head off, I'd like to thank you.
Now, just a minute—you can't—
I just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband.
Your ego is colossal.
This?  Oh, that's a matter of simple mathematics. These cabins cost two bucks a night and I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear, but the family purse won't stand for our having separate establishments. 
Here—
You'll find the showers—and things—right back of the second cottage. 
Very outspoken, too. Said I looked funny. Wasn't that cute?
Why, Peter! Don't you want to hear about our lovely friends?
Thank you.  My, my! Scrambled eggs.
Nope. No complaints.
Say, you were pretty good. Jumping in like that. Got a brain, haven't you?
It takes money to buy food.
I didn't give him anything . You were the big-hearted gal. How about wiring your father now?
Not a one.
What'd you say we're supposed to be doing?
If it's just the same to you, we'll sit right here till they come.  Got a toothpick?
There it is. Better swallow it. We're not going to have any breakfast.
Oh, they'll stop, all right. It's a matter of knowing how to hail them.
You might give me a little credit.
What were you going to do? Gold dig him for a meal?[13]
I couldn't arrive in New York at three in the morning. Everybody's in bed.
Yes. Haven't you thought about it at all? Seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy.
Why don't you stay and watch the fun? You'll enjoy it immensely.
No, it isn't. I'm hungry and—and scared.
Is that the Walls of Jericho going up?
Here's your ticket, ma'am.
Why, you can't put me out in the middle of the—
I'm hungry.
The dame's too smart for him.
Say, listen, you wouldn't know a story if it reached up and kicked you in the pants.  Yeah?  Sure, sure, I got your copy. Why didn't you tell me you were going to write it in Greek? I'd start a new department.
Okay, Joe. Listen—you know I've always liked you. Anytime I could do you a great turn—anytime I ran into a story that looked good—I always came running to you, didn't I? Well, I got one now. Those wires I sent you were on the level. It's the biggest scoop of the year. I'm giving it to you, Joe.
What's the thousand bucks for?
I wouldn't trust you as far as I could throw that desk.
You!
Thanks, Pal. You saved my life.
There you go—trustin' people again. How many times did I tell you—
Mebbe.
Then—you'll have to git !
Yeah.
A gat! A gat!  Got any fireworks on you?
Yeah ?—How do I know?  I gotta good mind to plug you.  I shouldn't take any chances on you.
Where do you live?
Got a couple of kids, huh?
You love them, don't you?
I don't care if he was doing it with giraffes in the zoo, Numa, it's none of our business.  Let's keep this side of it quiet, shall we?
The U.S. Attorney in Washington "declines" to serve our subpoena on Allen Dulles, Charles Cabell, CIA Director Richard Helms, or any FBI agent we named.
Yeah, she was pretty, all right, but not half as cute as you, Deano.  You shoulda tried a legitimate line of business.
What was his voice like?
Did he pay?
A bullshit President!  I don't see any weeping for all the thousands of Cubans that bastard condemned to death and torture at the Bay of Pigs. Where are all the tears for the Russians and Hungarians and Chinese living like slaves in prison camps run by Kennedy's communist buddies - All these damned peace treaties! I'm telling ya Jack, that's what happens when you let the niggers vote.  They get together with the Jews and the Catholics and elect an Irish bleeding heart.
Maybe there's more to this, Susie. The CIA's keeping something from our enemies.
Bill.
Your boss got a serious problem, Bill.  Real serious.  We know what's been going on at your office
What do you think, Lou?
Shaw.  Clay Shaw.
Clay Bertrand, Willie?
Lord, wake me, please.  I must be dreaming.
He had his palm print on the weapon.
But why?
I don't buy it, chief - why would the FBI cover it up?  You're talking the whole FBI here.  A telex that disappears from every single FBI office in the country?
Nick, what would happen if a man suffering from hypertension were to take an entire bottle of Proloid?
Can you ascertain if there's Proloid in his system?
Well, it doesn't make sense, Nick - he was afraid of dying, then he kills himself in a way that leaves no trace, but he leaves two unsigned suicide notes.
...and have you ever met David Ferrie?
Dave, I always play square.  No bugs. I'd love you to go on the record, but I"m in no hurry.  Whenever you're ready.
We went straight to Houston, and then Saturday night we drove to Galveston and stayed over there.
In the morning we went goose hunting. Then headed home, but I dropped the boys off to see some relatives and I stayed in Hammond.
Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison. I'm sorry, I got confused.  We got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we'd forgotten our shotguns.  Stupid, right?  So of course we didn't get any geese.
Leon's in a bad mood, don't get excited, he's all right.
I don't know.  Were you?  Who you scared of, Dave?
Was it the same Oswald, Dave, that was in Dallas, or was it an impersonator.
Did you take a good look at the TV when they had Oswald?
Then who killed the President?
Shit!  Forgot to glue this fuckin' rug today.  You know, at one time I even had a full head of hair like everyone else.  And then I lost that. That fuckin' Clay Shaw.  I hate the bastard.  All I got left is in his rotten, bloody hands.  He tipped the newspapers - I know it.  That's how the Agency works.  They use people, chew them up, spit 'em out.  Now it's my turn.
They'll get to you, too - they'll destroy you... They're untouchable, man...  I'm so fucking exhausted I can't see straight.
That's our case!
Daddy said it was all right if I was real quiet.
Dad, look what I drew.
Because of Kennedy?  Are the same people gonna kill us, Daddy?
I want the truth.
...you heard echoes.
I realize you're under a great deal of stress .. it's clouded your judgement.
Look, we can put you in a mental institution.  We can make you look crazier'n Marguerite Oswald, and everybody knows how crazy she is.
Four to six.
...which is strange 'cause this is less than 20 minutes after the assassination.
This is a man whose secrets cause us to change our radar patterns in the Pacific!  He should've been prosecuted as a traitor!
The next thing we know he's living in Dallas/Ft. Worth in October '62 working 6 months at Jaggars-Chiles- Stovall, a photographic firm that contracts to make maps for the U.S. Army... He starts work only days before the government reveals Russian missiles in Cuba and the crisis explodes.  Oswald may have had access to missile site footage obtained by the U2 planes and works alongside a young man who'd been in the Army Security Agency.
...now it gets positively spooky. In January, 1961 - in New Orleans, at the Bolton Ford Dealership - when the Oswald we know is in Russia - there is a man using the name "Oswald" to buy trucks for the Friends of Democratic Cuba.  The salesman never saw him again, but guess who's on the articles of incorporation of the Friends of Democratic Cuba?  Guy Banister.  Banister has someone using the name "Oswald" to buy the trucks.  Hoover, at the FBI, writes a memo dated June, 1960, that there could be someone using Oswald's passport and identity.
I'm sorry.
After dinner you paid him to have sex with you.
...and that this company is linked to the Schlumber tool company here in Houma, Louisiana - which is where their arms may have come from to David Ferrie and his Cubans...
This says "Mercer could not identify any of the photographs as being identical with the person she had observed slouched over the wheel of a green Ford pickup truck."  That's not true.  I recognized him and I told them so... They also said it was a dark green air conditioning truck, which it was not.  And here...  ...on the Dallas Sheriff's report. This is really strange.  See that notarized signature on the bottom of each page?  That's not my signature. And there never was any notary present during any of my questioning.  I guess that's all...
I can't believe a man as intelligent as Earl Warren ever read what's in those volumes.
These books are getting to your mind, Mr. Garrison.  I wish you'd stop readin' them.
Do you have any evidence against him, Jim?  Clay Shaw's done so much for the city with all that restoration in the Quarter.  He's well connected, all his friends, the money, people, be careful, Jim.
Because when I scheduled it I didn't realize it was a holiday.  You were there, why didn't you say something?
I think you care more about John Kennedy than your family!  All day long the kids are asking, "Where's Daddy?"  What am I supposed to tell your kids, Jim!
Honey, some crackpot.  Martin Luther King was killed in Memphis today!
Just a crank making phone calls. Happens a dozen times a day at the office.
Honey, come on.  The government wants you to be scared.  They want everybody to be scared to speak out.  They count on it.  But there's nothing to be scared of.
I'll take them up to my mother's if it'll make you feel better.  Spend a week.  I'll change the locks, the phone lines, I'll even get a bodyguard, all right?  Elizabeth, get a hold of yourself.
And if you're wrong?
Oh no!... How bad?
Post Office.
I took it once for a low thyroid condition...  It raises the metabolism, Lou.  Did David Ferrie strike you as the kind of person who had a low metabolism?
Earle Cabell.  And guess who his brother is?
His boss was the one on the Warren Commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community.
Are you giving me an ultimatum, Lou?
Are they?  Why would they?
I don't... I can't believe it.  They killed him because he wanted to change things.  In our time - in our country?
Just speculating, I guess.  How do you think it started?
He's done it before.  Other countries. Lumumba in the Congo, Trujillo, the Dominican Republic, he's working on Castro.  No big deal.  In September, Kennedy announces the Texas trip. At that moment, second Oswalds start popping up all over Dallas where they have the mayor and the cops in their pocket.  Y flies in the assassins, maybe from the special camp we keep outside Athens, Greece - pros, maybe some locals, Cubans, Maria hire, separate teams.  Does it really matter who shot from what rooftop?  Part of the scenery.  The assassins by now are dead or well paid and long gone...
...don't think so.  When they start to drool, they get rid of 'em.  These guys are proud of what they did. They did Dealey Plaza!  They took out the President of the United States!  That's entertainment!  And they served their country doing it.
You never ask a spook a question. No point.  He'll never give you a straight answer.  General Y still thinks of himself of the handsome young warrior who loved this country but loved the concept of war more.
And he never hit you before?
Why did Guy beat you, Jack?
Dave Ferrie - you know about him?
I've done quite well in Denver, Mr. Garrison, but I have to admire someone like you - and I have the means to back up what I say.
You were lucky.  I spent three years in the Pacific.  I've never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail-bonding companies. Why is that?
Then do you understand that I cannot tell the truth here?  In Dallas. That there are people here who do not want me to tell the truth... who do not want me to have a retrial?
Tomorrow I'll talk to your probation officer. Karen's a good kid, but she's mad at you, because you lied to her. This business about your grandmother's funeral
I understand.
So you're gonna call Karen tomorrow?
Won't forget?
What the fuck can I say? I'm serious, man. What the fuck can I say? Thank you... thank you... thank you.
How old is that machine gun shit?
I'd say there's about, oh, fifty thousand dollars here. What would you say Ray?
You got a good lawyer?
Great, you're here.
What's going on?
Can I have a word with you?
Hey, this is my office. There's no smoking.
Help yourself.
Four thirty. I'm meeting a woman.
I can give you a lift home if you'd like?
Are you really a bail bondsman?
Couldn't we just stop at a seven- eleven?
Is it dark?
Davidoffs. I get 'em in Mexico. They're hard to find here. I was locked up with the last two getting legal advice from a woman who was in for bustin' her boyfriend's head open with a baseball bat.
I'd say if you're tried and found guilty you won't get more than a year and a day. That's State time. Prison.
What did they want to know?
That would be Beaumont Livingston.
No, you didn't. What branch?
He's the one who wants you.
With ten thousand? Nine.
It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he's got a problem. He's -- what do you call it when you got money, but don't have cash?
Yeah, if I cooperate.
You get a chance to use it?
Want to hear some music?
I called in sick this morning. As far as the airline knows, I'm still available.
I don't know yet. I'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens.
He told me last night.
How do you get it out?
It's very possible Ordell's killed somebody.
How do you feel about getting old?
I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?
My ass ain't the same.
Does something else worry you?
What're you, a bag lady?
You don't actually do it that way?
Make the delivery somewhere in the mall.
He was here?
He tries to act cool.
No, I mean you, right now. Not it you were somebody else.
A lot of reasons. But the main one would be I'm tired of it.
And is that it?
I'm not sure you answered my question.
The feds. It's evidence.
I told them Ordell's changed the amount he's bringing in.
It'll be more than that.
He's liable to shoot you.
It never was, so I'm not gonna start worrying about it now. Look, Ray more or less believes my story, and he more or less doesn't care. All he really gives a shit about is getting Ordell.
Ordell called and wants to meet me and I'm scared.
Wanna go?
Yes'm.
I know what it looks like.
We'll just be a minute.
We can look into that.
Then how do you know he sells guns?
The envelope contains ten thousand dollars. The subject will be delivering the currency in a...
Ordell has a white guy working for him named Louis.
Not really.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
That would be one point of view.
I thought I did.
Uh-uh.
How long you been with Ordell?
You think I'm kidding?
Jackie?
How you doing, Ms. Jackie?
For what?
The same guy who put me in, thanks a lot.
Beaumont Livingston.
Yeah?
I understand woman, damn!
The Cockatoo Inn.
Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta confirm it!
...I make two deliveries. The first one with ten thousand, like a dry run. They watch it. See how it works. Then we do a second delivery, when I bring in the half mill.
If you want.
That's an agent. Manager's get fifteen percent.
Who?
Look, it's my ass facin' the penitentiary. You send some hard- headed roc whore, and she fucks things up.
Are you sure she don't know about the money?
Give it to the bail bondsman, Max Cherry. He'll take care of it.
When did you get out of jail?
How long?
Is it ready to go?
I thought you were sixteen.
Is it dead?
He killed a man worked for him the other night.
That's a nice outfit on her. I'm gonna go over and look at this Michi Moon display.
Louis, this is it, man. I'm gonna make me a million dollars out of this. I already got me a half-a- million sittin' in Mexico. When I do this last delivery, I'm gonna make me another half-million.
Louis, my man. Watcha doin'?
I'm talkin' to you from the comfy- cozy interior of an Oldsmobile parked outside your nasty-ass welfare motel.
Uh-huh.
What's your relationship?
You didn't even hafta say it. I know the woman.
Uh-huh.
Maybe forty, maybe not that much.
Came outta where?
'fore I blow that bitch's brains out, I'll ask her.
Jesus Christ.
You know the motherfucker's a bail bondsman, don't ya? You know every last one of them motherfuckers is crooked as hell?
I'm going to Del Amo, see a movie, get something to eat.
That's Winston. He works here.
It's in my bag.
Who's it for? A relative?
Ten thousand sounds high.
Oh, yeah? What did he do?
The bond for possession is only a thousand.
That's what the police thought. I told them I'm unemployed, how could I have anybody work for me? Now I bail out Jackie, I'm liable to have the police on me again, huh? Wanting to know was she doing things for me, was she bringing me that money!
If there's no -- what do you call it -- confidentiality between us? Why would I tell you anything?
Why would a stewardess bring me fifty grand?
You still there?
Now, is there anything you want to tell me before we get out of this car?
Hey, hey, hey. I think somebody's got some new clothes.
Ha-ha-ha. I'm serious, you smoke too much of that shit. That shit robs you of your ambition.
Hello.  Hey, Jackie...  No, Jackie, I didn't get your message.
He ain't here right now.
Remember?
What do you want?
By who? Why? Paul didn't have an enemy in the world.
Grass never did that to me.
You're hurting me!
Daddy. Let go.
Hello.
Listen, I just got a strange call from Geary. He said the guys backed down. What's he talking about?
Daddy, what was that noise?
It's cold.
Wait ... Daddy.
I'm sorry, Mr. Singer, but do you have any idea how many people come to me with the injustices of the world? It'd break your heart.
Listen, will you listen? They're trying to get me. They're comin' out of the walls. The army's done something to me. I need you.
It means that you and your buddies are whacko, that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in Thailand.
Not me, buddy.
I know you. How come you're so tense today?
I saw Sarah the other day.
She said you were a son of a bitch and she regrets the day she set eyes on you.
I don't know. I've been having them recently.  You know, you look like an angel, Louis, an overgrown cherub. Anyone ever tell you that?
Jacob, if it was any other brain but yours, I might agree.  Tell me, does your lady friend know what a brilliant thinker, what a sub- lime intellect she's living with?
No.  I see them.
I know very little about demons, Ja- cob, fleshy ones anyway. I know them as literary figures, biblical ones ... Dante, Milton ... but Jacob,  this is the 20th Century. We don't see demons now.
Yes.  I don't want them. I'm not looking for analysis or drugs. It's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis.  It's more than that. I can feel it. I need you Prof. You're the only one I can talk to.
I'm sorry but there's no record of a Jacob Singer in our files.
What was that?
What a dream I was having. I was living with another woman ... You know who it was?
She was good in bed, though.
I'm going to have to move you a bit, just to check for injuries. This may hurt a little.
Gee, thanks a lot.
I moved the couch. That's all.
What happened to you?
Thanks.  What's that?
Who? Jed?
And where do you think Jezebel comes from?
Ready?
New York is filled with creatures. Everywhere. And lots of stations are closed.
Why? What for?
What does it say?
I can't do it.
Don't gimme that.
Look, I'm horny. Keep it in mind.  Love me a little?
I want to know. You tell me!
Why are you doing this to me? You can't just go away like that.
How?
It's amazing, you know, that a drug could change things like that, destroy a life and then give it back. It's hard to believe that the world could be so hellish on day and like heaven the next.
Where are they?
What's going on?
WHO ARE YOU?
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
It's going to be all right, Jake. It's going to be all right. Don't be afraid. I've got you now.
I'm not bugging you. Come and lie down. I'll give you a massage.  Where'd you go today?
Where's West? New Jersey?
Do what? I haven't done a thing.
This isn't happening.
None of us can remember that night. I get flashes of it but they don't make sense. We saw shrinks for years. But nothing they did could ever touch it. What happened? Was there ever an offensive?
But there was an attack. I can still see them coming. There was a fight, wasn't there?
How do I know this isn't just some kind of, you know, seduction or something?
I can't move.
Mike, it was real. It was glorious.
I would have stayed there if I could.
Here. I've got every credit card ever printed. Take this. Stay here till you can arrange to get away. It's on me.
How 'bout over there?  No wait. Do me a favor. Bring 'em to the back room.
He's burning up.
Push 'em back.
I'm sorry.
Jesus Christ. How've you been? What's happening in your life?
It's almost like a conspiracy, huh?
Let's get a couple drinks, okay?  Hey, take a look behind us. Do you think that car is followin' us?
What is it Paul? What's happening to me?
Last month, before Thanksgiving.
Watch it punk, I'm armed.
That's nine to four, geek-boy.
That sucks. Why won't he go down?
I don't have all day, kid.
Just make a break for the door. He'll get some of us, but that's the breaks.
It's locked!
Rizzo pull the fucking lever!
The ship's depressurizing, the engines overheating. When it  reaches the core, we're done.
Bomb?
Blowing the walkway? You come up with that yourself?
Where the hell were you?!!
Hey! I'm not ready.
How many?
Where is...?
It bought us some time.
Ok Sarge, what's your status?
Report to weapons. We're going on a hunt.
We're screwed!
Rizzo?!
My father's company imports and exports. Archaeology is part of the business. We happen to get along just fine, smartass. Look, why don't you bust somebody else's balls for a change.
Jason seemed to have the right stuff. Physically, anyway. Radiation, cell damage, didn't matter. He just kept going.
You know, this future shit sucks. I'll fucking do it.
Got it.  You ever space walked?
You wanna release your air tanks?
No thank you, you crazy old woman.
Well?
Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?
Oh, shit. He's going to see us.
I...I don't know what I did...
Fat Lou, we're changing courses for the Solaras Space Lab.
I'm gonna spew.
You're so bossy.
Jesus!
I'm surrounded by idiots.
Kay-Em, you okay?
You did good, Kay-Em. I'm proud of you.
Leave him behind!
Something's wrong.
Damn!  Close the door! I'll be right back.
Where..? Who . . .?  I'm alive. You brought me back.
Jason? He's on this ship?!
That's ridiculous. You're overreacting.
More soldiers?
How do you open the damn door?
It's okay, he just wanted his machete.
Listen to me. Please. Let's get off thsi ship. Come with me.
Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds.
Cash? Or do we do this on a handshake and a promise?
And my regular daily rate -- $200, whether we catch him or not.
And, uh, a case of apricot brandy and you buy the lunch.
Hey. Knock it off. I don't want to have to listen to this while we're out there...
What's the point with hooks and Lines? --
That's it! Radio in for help!
What about us?
Probably out in the back yard.
The kids are in the yahd, playing near the cah. How's that sound?
Don't forget these.
Be careful.
There's only one thing you're good for anymore -- signing a damn voucher. Here. It's an authorization to employ a contractor.
I'm going to hire Quint to kill the fish. I want to see that shark dead.
Left arm, head, shoulders, sternum and portions of ribcage intact.  Please don't smoke. With minor post- mortem lacerations and abrasions. Bite marks indicate typical non-frenzy feeding pattern of large squali, possibly carchaninus lonimanus, or isurus glaucas. Gross tissue loss and post-mortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis; however, teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters.  -- Did you go out in a boat and look around?
Something else. Do most attacks go unreported?
There's a kind of a lone shark, called, uh...
...And it was Dartmouth Winter weekend, and she was Homecoming Queen, and I was her date; then she got into the fact that her family had more money than my family, and she was right -- her great-grandfather was in mining, and my ancestors were Yankee shipbuilders. So we broke up and I went home with some beatnik from Sarah Lawrence.
If you're looking for a shark, you don't look on land. You go out and chum for him.
We will. There's something I've got to find out.
There is a kind of shark called a Great White Shark that every expert in the world agrees is a maneater.
There's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days. It happened like this before, in 1916, when a Great White killed five swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long Island.
Wait a minute! I need you.
What the hell?
Christine what?
You picked her up on the ferry.
Think she might've run out on you?
What d'you pay for a place just for the summer?
Mrs. Kintner must've put her ad in Field and Stream.
...and Bill Mayhew almost caught him in his net...?
Hi. I'm Matt Hooper. If your husband is here, I'd like to talk to him.
Would you like something? Some coffee?
My husband tells me you're in sharks.
Yep.
...push this? Oh. It's working. Hello, Martin?
I just wanted to know if you were all right... the Coast Guard let me use their radio. Is Chief Brody there?
What have you got there, Lenny?
That's pilot whale, isn't it?
I don't know what it is, but it's not a shark.
Paul? Are you coming downstairs to eat?
Yeah, I swiped it from Ms. Rancick.
Your shorts are looking especially gold today.
Whose idea was it?
Oh, I couldn't copy your work.
Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?
Charisma?
Really? What are they like?
Jesus, Bleek.
Hey Junebug, when all this is over we should get the band back together again.
Well, we were once. You know, that time.
You're mad. Why are you mad?
That's not how our thing works! I hurl the accusations and you talk me down, remember?
I still have your virginity!
What, you mean as friends?
Mine too.
Well, yeah. You're the best friend I've ever had, even when you're being kind of evil.
I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train. I kiss you all starryeyed, my body's swinging from side to side. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
What a trip, man.
You should grow a moustache. You're a real man now.
What? I'm not made of stone.
They could be utterly negligent. Maybe they'll do a far shittier job of raising a kid than my dumbass stepdaughter ever would. Have you considered that?
Did you see it coming when she sat us down here?
Oh, God...
A couple of hours? Why are you going up there in the first place?
That was a mistake, Juno. Mark is a married stranger. You overstepped a boundary.
It doesn't work that way, kiddo. You don't know squat about the dynamics of marriage.
No, I mean in your pregnancy.
Amanda, I told you to go to the infirmary and lie down. You never listen.
This is our attorney, Gerta Rauss.
So, let's discuss how we're gonna do this... thing.
No shit. Like Johannes Brahms?
Well, it can really only go two ways.
Junk?
I know what junk is.
Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby...
The Wizard of Gore?
This is even better than Suspiria. You've got decent taste in slasher movies, Mark.
Madison? Isn't that kind of... I don't know, gay?
Vanessa. Shit, you better get out of here.
I imagine you have a collection of punk chestnuts to prove your point.
I'm dying to see what you've got to teach me.
Wow. That shirt is working hard.
Oh, Mark! Is this the baby's room? It's beautiful!
"Most Fruitful Yuki"? What is... Oh my god, she's a pregnant superhero!
I'm leaving Vanessa.
But I thought you'd be cool if...
A baby is not going to fix everything. Besides, I don't know if I'm ready to be a father.
I... How do you think of me, Juno? Why are you here?
Good. I'm good.  Did you finish that paper for Worth's class yet?
You should try Adderall.
Juno! Your baby probably has a beating heart, you know. It can feel pain. And it has fingernails.
Hi! I'm Vanessa. You must be Juno and Mr. MacGuff. I'm Vanessa.
Can I take your coats?
I'll get drinks. What would everyone like? I've got Pellegrino, Vitamin Water...
Oh, that's marvelous. So you're almost into your second trimester, then?
I think pregnancy is beautiful.
Sure. The powder room down here is being re-tiled, but you can use the master bath upstairs. Go up, then turn left and on your right...
Oh. Sure. Of course you'd want to know how your kid is cooking.
Juno! God, you startled me. What are you doing here? What's wrong?
Um, I think people are kind of unsure about the situation because it's not, you know, set in stone.
Well hi Vanessa! What brings you to the mall today?
Would you like some free condoms? They're boysenberry.
You should have seen this octopus furnace. I had to get out my Hazmat suit just to get up in there...
Okay, this is no laughing matter.
Tot ice skating? Tots can't ice skate. Liberty Bell's still getting the hang of stairs.
I'm losing my faith in humanity.
I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.
What?!
Is this for real? Like for real, for real?
Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year.
Heavy lifting can only help you at this point.
Well, maybe you could look at one of those adoption ads. I see them all the time in the Penny Saver.
Oh yeah! "Desperately Seeking Spawn." They're right by the ads for like, iguanas and terriers and used fitness equipment. It's totally legit.
The Penny Saver sucks.
Look at this one "Wholesome, spiritually wealthy couple have found true love with each other."  "All that's missing is your bastard."
All right, how about this one? "Healthy, educated couple seeking infant to join our family of five. You will be compensated. Help us complete the circle of love."
Check out Baby Big-Head. That kid is scary!
Please do not refer to Mr. Conyers as "Keith," okay? My barf reflex is already heightened these days.
Oh, it totally does. I was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like Lipton Landing. But you know, boys have endured worse things for nookie.
Are you jealous? I thought you said you didn't care what he did.
Yes. Heating and air conditioning.
You should read the book. I even flagged the "daddy chapters" for you.
What did you do?
I've been just wondering if we're, you know, ready.
I called Gerta Rauss. She says she can represent both of us. They call it "collaborative divorce." It's apparently all the rage right now. And it's easy because we don't have children.
Have you found a place to stay?
...There ain't nothin' can kill 'em. They can live for two even three hundred years.
Early don't think women should smoke or curse or drink liquor.
I'm cool.
Hold still.
Adele... are you serious?
Happy birthday Adele.
What's up Adele? Dinner ready?
Don't be long now, dinner's 'bout ready.
What if they're dangerous?
Geez, they look kinda weird.
Early, what're you doin'?
What the hell is this stuff?
...I don't know.
What's wrong with her?
Where you from Walter?
Tight fit.
Brian.
So what do you do Early?
This guy killed a mess of people.
Henry Lucas.
How did he get away with it for so long anyhow?
That bad?
...They never caught that Black Dolya Killer, huh?
That your... "theory", ain't that what they call it?
Wait a minute. You're gonna hustle me?
...Well I probably drunk more than my share, anyway... you go on an' have it.
...Well then, that's how many I killed.
Ya see what I'm sayin'?  Ha!
Look, fuck the thesis. I think there's a book here. Your photographs and my research, together.
What I'm thinking is, we can drop down through Tennessee, across Arkansas and into Texas, from there it's a straight shot into California.  "We don't stop... until we hit the fucking ocean."
What did he sound like on the phone?
I like that.
Jesus... They've probably got five bucks between them. Turn around.
We could have been in and out of there in less than ten minutes...
All set?
Brian I want him out of our car!
You gotta talk to her. She looks up to you, she'll listen to you.
Sometimes... Don't know why it is... I get so hot I can't stand it. I just start sweating like a dog. You ever get like that?
Darlin' you were 'bout that far from spendin' the night at the morgue. You understand?
Could be.
How many times have you gone unprotected?
Well, girl. You tested negative for all sexually transmitted diseases and infections.
Oh shit. How long did it take?
And there was this picture of her painting Easter eggs or something. And I said, you were cute when you were little.
I mean I'm dreaming about going all out, crazy shit.
That would be good. But I mean more like. I don't know. Like when I was having sex with her, I kept thinking how much I would like to put it in her ass. Just to see what would happen.
Get another forty.  Smoke a blunt.
And it got me thinkin'. How fun it would be to share each other's girl.
I'm not joking. I wanted to take my dick out and start jacking right there. At that point and moment, Darcy was like a vision of perfection.
Whenever you see someone who's really messed up, especially amputees and retards. You give them money. But if it's just a regular bum, you pass them by.
About ten. Fifteen is good.
You think Darcy is gonna be at Nasa tonight?
Where you at?
I'm goin'. You on the list?
Yeah watch the fuck where you skate. You know what I'm saying?
Come on. Come swimmin' with us.
Yeah. Come on.
You know I've been thinking about you lately.
I was lookin' for you all day today.
I thought you had a girlfriend.
You should come back with me to Steven's house.
Who are they?
You know what I want to do?
Dance!
How old are you?
Can I ask you a question? I'm sorry. I don't mean to be a pest.
Sorry.
No, not everything? The sun is still shinning. It's a beautiful day out. Some things are OK. Right?
Hello.
You are being ripped open.
Right. You're like it's just this instinct. It's like this animal instinct is taking over you. It's like...
And sometimes it takes a long time, and you're fucking gagging.
Shh. Come on, it's gonna be OK.
Just a lot of crazy shit.
Diss digg, diss digg, diss digg.
I'll ask you one last time. Do you have diss digg?
And you don't get shit out of it.
Yep.
Yeah.
Oh shit.
Me. I can only take it up to fifteen minutes. Cause I get bored.
I've known the past of all the people I've fucked without a condom. Like I know one of the people got tested and was negative.
And I know that one of them fucked like two other girls, who were both virgins, so I knew he was safe.
How can you hang out with Casper? He's such a jerk.
I hate 'em.
Yeah?
Not too late.
First times are always wacked. Just be glad you didn't lose your virginity in the backseat of a rental car.
Yeah.
I can't man.
I've talked to a few people who say you and her were... friendly?
I think you're lying.  That's what kind of problem.
Meaning, it looks like his victims are chosen at random.
We didn't ask for your opinion, Doctor.
He's not talking about himself.
I was with him the whole time until I got the call at the hotel.
Ready for round two?
Why not?
I suppose you want to know where I'm going to kill tonight, Peter?
Hello?
What?
Emotional?  I expected more from you.
Sure.  We've got a modem line hooked up with the data base in New York.
No problem.  We're in.
Now what?
Computers.  That's how you got into Homesearchers records.  You can get into anything.  But why?  Why?
You might not have done it had you known.
Would you mind keeping your voice down? I have guests.
The police came to me for help.  What could I do?
Come here.
Congratulations, dad.
You told me you'd take me over to Seattle today.
It isn't Kathy.
Whaddaya got, Nolan?
How long she been dead?
Only that you wanted someone from the institute to talk to Sanderson for some case you're working on.  What'd he do?
I see you're still having problems with your openings.
Kathy?
That would indicate he's playing out a fantasy.  Power-control killers usually fantasize about their actions long before they commit them.  Once they become a reality though, they reach a sense of euphoria and need to repeat the act to sustain it.  But, in all the research I've read on Serial Killers, I've never heard of one moving so fast. It's as if the game is the catalyst for the murders -- not the other way around.
Well, I think you have to play to his ego.  He thinks he's superior.  The more secure he feels, the more chances he'll take.
We can't rely on your judgement anymore.
Did you see his face?
Excuse me... you said earlier that Mary Albert just moved in.  How long ago was that?
Do you know how she found the apartment?
I know you're busy so I'll get right to it.  Did you know her?
What have you come up with on the riddle?
Another one?  What word did he leave?
He's not going to give us direct hints. He's going to skirt around it.
Where were you last night?
It's a good play, but risky.
Peter...
You have something you want to say?
About what?
Feel like practicing?
I can check and call you back.
Bainbridge Books.
Are you with the tournament?
You sure you don't want to eat something?
It wasn't intentional.
In a way.
Do you?
Of course.
No.
Doesn't that scare you?
Why?
Wasn't I just talking about me?
I just don't want to fight with you.
I thought you were the woman who didn't want to get involved.
Did you call?
He's replaying the game I played against him move by move, using these girls as the Chess pieces.  All the girls have been found in their homes except Christie Eastman, who was found in back of a warehouse.  Why?
That's still no excuse.  You treat everything like a game.
How did you know it was "carefully"?
You're going to be late for your match.
Take off your clothes. I'm going to scrub you down.
There. Now you look like someone I might want to marry.
Have they harmed you?
Lyssa ...
I love you, Lyssa, I love you ...
In the Arctic ice.
You will go alone.
The White Castle has fallen.
Your powers are greater than you know.  Have you ever seen one of these?
No. They occupy the Fortress, but they cannot control its movement. It is moved by Fate. And, sooner or later, Fate will place it near us.
You have not slept in two days.
You choose these?
I cannot reach her.
<u>Why</u>?
But you suspect.
Can she be forced?
I will melt that gold and pour it down your throat, old man!
From here, I must go alone.
They will hold Lyssa in the Center of the Vortex, the place of the Beast, where its power is greatest. No man can match it there. Lyssa must try to move toward us. For as we enter the Vortex and move closer ...
She must make a glaive.
She can see the Beast!
You must move quickly. The Beast will stop at nothing now.
Each to his fate.
I know the cruelty of such a fate.
Am I not beautiful enough to be loved?
Once is enough, thank you.
My <u>friend</u>.
Well, I'm not impressed.
Forgive me, my friends. I saw terrible things.
Go. I command you.
Make for the wall. I'll catch up.
Tonight and every night, my friend, for this is the second time you've saved my life.  I am Ergo the Magnificent, short in stature, tall in power, etcetera, etcetera.
A venison pie as big as a house.
Quell?
You do?
If I could wish ...  ... for anything, I'd wish for a venison pie the size of a ...  ... mountain. No, that's too greedy. I'd settle for one the size of a house.
Sir Ergo? ... My honorable Lord Ergo? ...
What? Now you poke me in the nose as well?
Oh, she was so beautiful - and I was so <u>ugly</u>.
Put me down, you lout!
Look at its beauty. Look at its grace.
I do not want your power. It is hideous.
I do not want your worlds or your slaves.
He will not!
For some, the lure of power is stronger than the ties of blood. No matter. I had hoped to have the wedding next spring, Lord Turold, with all the nobles of the kingdom in attendance. But Fate and this war have ordained otherwise.
Modred! Impossible!
We seek the Fortress of Krull.
Can you see?
The Dark Ones will appose you with all their power.
Yes.
Perhaps she will not kill me, for I know her name.
Kegan!
It is fifty years since I heard that name.
You had a son.
Memory is no trick, it is a power. The power to see.
Could I lie to you and still see your beauty?
Give me his name, I will mail him.
...Office 2702.
It's better...  You see, it's my turf, so I don't want contracts I'm not informed about, on my turf.  I'm not opposing, but the least they can do is informing me, isn't it?
At a certain moment I thought: maybe Leon would like working on his own? So he makes some little extras?
Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.
Here, this is the light scoop for night shooting. There, you fix client's distance... How much to the bench down there in the park?
Rocket launcher.
Good! First shot!
The yellow and pink.
Come on, get down!
I was nervous, that's all! Where is the guy?
For musicals?  That's part of the job!
...You can leave whenever you want. I don't refrain you.
Well... Then may you rent me your gear for the day?
...OK.  I love you anyway.
OK, OK! Excuse me! How old were you when you had your first contract?
Yeah, I know! But for the moment you're not yet a woman. So, be patient... I need time... And you too. You have to grow up.
Poor darling, and then?
Well... I don't know, suddenly, the make up... All this... How are you?  Are you OK?
...That's awful.  I hope you killed, that asshole?
What do you do, with the money you earn?
Huh? Move back, baby, I can't see anything.
Is he still alive?
I think I will get back in Messina this summer... It's too long I haven't been there.
What is it?
Here comes the resume.
I don't accept that.
Uncle Maurice -- I spent all our frequent flyer miles on a one way ticket here... I have a rented car outside, just listen to me.  Come back with me now, and if you still want to do something like this in a year -- maybe we'll plan a car trip across the country -- Gerald and I will come along --
What if you don't make it?
If you really want to do this... plan it out.  Rest up.  Train for it.  Build up your body.  Plan every stop along the way.  How much money?  Time?  Really do it properly.  This is all so -- by the seat of your pants.
I've all ready gone six hundred miles... I can't do it again.
Then it'll have to wait until I finish.
Listen to me very carefully, because I don't want you to misunderstand me... The walk is over Uncle Maurice.  Done. Finished.  You've made it to California, it was a miracle, now let's try to save your life.
How long does this... Mania last?
Look, I'll see if anyone has spotted him recently.  If I get any information, I'll call you.
Are you a preacher?
You're feeling old and you want to start exercising.  A lot of men your age feel the need to recapture their youth.  Don't feel embarrassed about it.
Anything?
There's no reason.
Walk with me?
... People that were made to be parents, and people who were not made to be parents... My parents, were people who were not made to be parents but had kids anyway.  I don't want us to be that way Ellen.
It must've hit the window... I think its neck is broken.
Your father?
Maurice?
To where?
That's a reasonable assumption.
Doubts?  About what?
Why so vague?  Why so evasive?  He could be somebody hot.
It's going to look beautiful when he turns out to be that animal who paid a visit to the Steadman's house.
A marriage certificate?  Who the hell carries their marriage certificate around?
Each inch represents 150 miles...
This story is big huh?
What are you saying?  This story is too big for this paper?
Lizy, Eliza... Elizabeth Bennett...  Pride and Prejudice.
Are you firing me?
Tom Joad?
I missed you Kris.
Come on Mr. Parker.
Mr. Parker, you can yell at me, if it'll help.  But I'm not risking your life.
In a hospital.
Is it a boy or a girl?
I don't have kids.
May I ask you a question that might sound strange?
What's your shoe size?
What do you want?
Everything's ten dollars, and there's no alcohol.
Sparkling apple cider?
Water?
One drink minimum per show. Everything's ten dollars. Now... tell me what you want or I'll eighty- six you.
Sarah -- with an H?
Umm. We can stay in the car for an hour if you want. But I really have to go then. It's your time.
I cashed in all of my money, paid my AmEx card, gonna sell the car tomorrow.
Don't run away.
I think you know I'm serious. I'll pay you if you like... but I'd like to see you.
Yes.
I'm from the East. I went to college, did an arts course. I now live in Vegas. I think of it as home. I came here deliberately to carve out a life. I was in LA before, but I'll come back to that later.  The tough times are behind me now. I can deal with the bad things that happen. There will always be dark characters. But my life is good. It is as I would want it to be. So, why are you a drunk?
Hi!
Right... the suitcase was clinking. So what did you do with your clothes?
I'm going to fill it right now.
I like women who wear mismatched earrings.
What do you mean?
I told them you were an alcoholic and I would take you home. I also promised that we would never come in there again.
You were OK for a while, so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck, but I think even you knew that wasn't going to happen. We got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store, even though I told you that we had plenty at home. In the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to keep the change. I asked you if you knew it was a hundred. You said you did, so I let you do it. We got here, you fell asleep on the couch and I covered you up and came to bed.
I don't understand any of that.
Thank you, Sera.
Maybe I should follow you around and ask one of your tricks what it's like to sleep with you.
Shall we go away for a couple of days?
Where was that house? The one in LA, I mean.
I've missed the best sun. Why did you have to pawn your watch?
Maybe it's time I moved to a hotel.
There are limits.
So... are you alone, or are you just using me to make someone else jealous?
Well... I thought you might be looking for a date.
You have been lonely?
I'm pleased with you, Sera... how you have moved up in the world. I showed you a glamorous world when I took you off the streets...  and how you repay me.
But it's a top three school --
Brooke, I believe you. But a jury is gonna want an alibi.
What're you so happy about? You're on trial for murder.
Is he always such an ass?
But is he an ass that's gonna win my case?
I'm a Delta Gamma and I'm a huge fan of yours!
Are you okay? You look so sad... and so orange.
Elle, I can't. You don't understand.
I got out of the shower, walked downstairs, saw her standing over my father, and called the police.
Uh, yeah, because the bitch shot him.
Okay -- Ms. Windham, when you uh arrived back at the house? Was your father there?
How many, would you say?
Chutney, why is it that Tracy Marcinko's curls were ruined when she got hosed down?
And if you in fact, heard the gunshot, then Brooke Windham wouldn't have had time to hide the gun before you got downstairs. Which would mean that you would've had to have found Mrs. Windham with a gun in her hand to make your story sound plausible. Isn't that right?
Did you get it?
You followed your intuition today and you were right on target. I should've listened.
You're hitting on me?
What did you see when you entered the house?
So she was distraught that her husband was dead?
-- his life?
Could I be anymore goddamn spastic?  So you're sure, this Warner guy is "the one"?
I feel so bad for her. I mean, she's in jail! And she's innocent. But I'm the only one who believes her. Donovan totally thinks she's guilty.
So, this is the only interaction you two have ever had?
Good one.
I'm here to see Brooke Windham.
Uh -- family.
The idiot speaks.
I believe her, too. I don't think she's having an affair with Enrique.
Can someone please tell Rick that he is not the only Sigma Chi with a big penis?
Hello! You're like, a lawyer.
No, but she made me cry once. Not in class -- I waited until I got to my room, but yeah, she can pretty much shrivel your balls -- or you know, your whatevers.
Good luck.
A) He's an old man with a really big penis. B) She never told me I was fat. And C) Victoria Principal sells on that network.
I can't believe you called me a butthead. No one's called me a butt- head since ninth grade.
How can you still believe she's innocent?
In that case, maybe Heyworth got fellated by a brunette and Brooke caught him.
I don't --  Do that stuff.
Back up. How do you know he's gay?
Whoa -- Why?
Up for a celebration dinner?
I don't know --
It's pink.
Maiden name -- Daniels.  You know her?
I'm fully amenable to that discussion.
I completely agree.
Proposing?! Elle, If I'm going to be a politician, I need to marry a Jackie, not a -- Marilyn.
It made me realize something. I'm an idiot.
Where?
But I guess it wasn't enough for Brooke.
Elle?
Oh, God. What if Josh doesn't think I'm serious enough?
Why?!
Fool's magic.
Dumb magic.  Giant smash peewee.
God protect me.
No more... please...
When you are ripe for my pleasure, I will enjoy the harvest.
Your soul...?  Why should I bother with such a paltry trifle?
What was that?  Did you hear that?
And I with you... I never dreamed life held such pleasures...
Now I want to live forever.  I've never felt so strong or happy.
Yes.  I feel that, too.  Weakness is what is ugly.
What you do, boy?  You be velly solly, come here intellupt my sleep.
What?  Speakee loud!  No hear velly good.
Baron Couer de Noir is a blight 'gainst all nature.  We dwarves be not fighters; still we are with you in this battle.  Some of our handiwork may be of assistance.
And if I cannot?
True... But it won't come easy or free.  If ye want to ask, ask Jenny Greenteeth.
Did you hear?  Twas the killing of the unicorn caused it.
There's the spirit, lad.  If ye run into trouble, give a yank here and we'll haul ye up.
There be no finer victuals than worm flesh, lad.
I'm small... and I can make myself smaller still... Small as a bee! Small as dust...!  Want to see me do it?
I'll drop a cow on the knave!
Track the demon to his lair.
Aye.  He's enchanted the lot of them.  His reward for delivering the unicorn.
My God!  Look!
Certainly understandable.
I pray always to be worthy of it.
Don't let this talk of heroes upset you, Jack.  Sigurd's sword is no great thing.  The Volsung killed Fafnir.  You killed Lindfarne. That's one worm apiece... I'd say you and Sigurd were neck-and-neck.
Wait!
Is she... dead?
Can we trust him?
Don't like the feel of it, Jack.
Tells you something 'bout him what lives there...
A fine mess this is... horrid, nipping creatures... What do we now, Jack?
There aren't enough arrows.
Water doesn't burn...
What magic have we on our side?
The kitchen be the most important room in a palace, for if the victuals ain't right, little else is likely to be so.
Sunlight.
The quest's at an end and where's the good of it?  A faerie festival over a pile of bones?
I'll do anything... face any challenge!
Barely living, from the looks of it.
You see!  You see!
We seek to undo the curse.
Liar!
Let's rest a minute.  I'm so thirsty.
The napkin will keep.  I'd rather not be alone.
I am a princess.  You have no right to order me about.
Such grace... and their smell; it's ambrosia.
Oh Jack, mightn't I touch one?  It would thrill me so.
Where are you going?
What happened?
Damned hunters.  It was a trap, and you were the bait!
He did run?
My heart intends no more than that you love me as I do you.
No!  Don't let go... you mustn't!  I love you!
What's the matter?
Step lively now!
Here be the death weapon; the unicorn's blood dry upon it.
How do I get the horn back?
Where do I find the Baron's castle?
What became of the princess?
Twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky.
No!
I don't believe you.
Were I a mortal girl, Jack, methinks I'd be in love with you.
Wondrously so.
That was in jest.
Praise be to God.
Where?
Uhm... fine work.
Simple as that, eh?
Let that be our problem, just get us there.
Are you going to see Sam again?
You can go back to bed...or Lois might let you go swimming.
I woke up this morning at three and couldn't fall back asleep.  Everyday I think I see more of Sam than I've seen in years.
That's how you get things right is to always try and never give up.  Huh, Mom?
So put your plans of my room in the trash.
What are you doing up so early?
Sorry I got you into trouble.
I mean drugs.  I thought you said he was?
You have to ask like that?
Did you feel anything?
Where's your dad?
Huh?
Not really.  No.  Kinda.  He got busted?
We're not gonna do anything.
Not really.
You hate your father.
You're so nice to let Sam use your shower.
Why is that?
And of course the Beck's, with the...
Funny how he's the architect and you're just a loud mouth cop.
Mr. Dokos says that your father missed his height envelope by six inches.
All of us are typing and clicking, George.  Whether we want to, or not.
Forty.
Then it sounds like I'm doing you a favor.
I didn't know there would be a quiz, George.
Well, I feel better about this now.
Well, it's the least I can do.
If she's not up, you can use my shower.
You're here early today.
This has got to stop!
It'll just be my brother the dweeb on weekends.  All we gotta do is sand and paint the cabin, dude.  My dad's gonna let me use the boat and my charm is gonna let me use my rod.  Income village is the place to hook up with hump.
I never said anything.  I haven't done anything.
I'll be around to check up on you.
Because I live there.
I'm not going!
Are you totally insane?!
I want you to take out your nose ring and leave it out.
You'll have money when you work.
I don't beg.
Where are you going?
I was holding for someone.  That wasn't even mine.
Sun glasses?
Why wouldn't she leave?
I would have killed him.
After everything.
Dale wants to know if we should run an outside outlet for Christmas lights with a switch inside?
She seemed upset.
I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?
I never tried to get you to like me.  I tried to get you to love me.
I aimed high.
Was bankrupt and dead before I was twenty.
Your kid was down around Diver's Cover again, smoking pot.  I didn't write him up...told him I wouldn't tell you...
It's my day off.  I thought I'd help with the plumbing.
God, you look like crap, George.
Why do you let your dog crap on his lawn, day after day?
You should lock your doors.
I called everyone, everywhere!  You just vanished!  You could be dead!
You're inconsiderate and absolutely devoid of emotion!
Forget it, really.  I'll survive.
No.  I was going to let you do that.
George --
It makes me sad.
I was here six years.  And I only hated two.
You head was pressed against my chest.  I could feel your heart racing.  And I remember I kissed your hair.
Go in there and lick his attitude.
Where's Sam?
Do you need help?
Tell him how you made me fall in love with you.
Maybe you shouldn't come everyday.
I know they're not much help, but they love coming here, George.
When I picked you up from the train station...what you said.
I kept thinking about it, what you said... I hope you were trying to keep me away fro the sake of me.
Peter left me yesterday.
No goodbye.  No fuck you.  No 'Are you in love with George?'
Nothing.
He said he heard hammering.
Then you tell me, what just happened?
To shave your chest?
I'd love to drive through New England in the Fall.
Sam is working at something for the first time in his life.  Once in a while he even talks to me.  I want to be around for that.
You never really trusted me.
Do you know anything about building a house?
I guess I could teach you some things.
The door was open.
Why do we have to get up and eat with you this early?
Ryan, would you rather swim or work?
I brought a few of my own.
A night in the hole?
She'll be fine. She just had a bit of a shock.
Biscuit, when you're done with Jangle Leg, you think you could squeeze me in?
I'm talking about a haircut.
It's 1945. It's a different world now.
We get the games on the radio sometimes.
You probably mean Can't Get Right. That's him over there.
You can try, but you won't get too far. Why you interested?
Maybe you didn't notice, but this is a prison.
Look, I am truly sorry about this. I'd like to help you...
No, but...
Yeah...
I know she's sorry she won't be seeing you anymore. Anyway, she wanted me to take care of you.
You know, go to the tonk or whatever.
Damn dentures slipping again. Everything falls apart when you grow old, eh, Claude? Time sure marches on.
Cool it, Ray. You're gonna get us in a lot of trouble.
I got it... boss.
Did you go see my cousin Maynard like I asked you in my letter?
Yeah, that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains. I hope he don't mess things up.
Listen, Claude, Maynard wanted to know if he should file the appeal on behalf of your friend, too.
Well, Mr. "C", how about buying a girl a drink?  Two bourbons.
Ten dollars. But I need it to get home.
Come on, daddy-o. You haven't said a word since we started. Least you could do is make some friendly conversation.
That's some long green.
What?
Well, maybe I should dig around in other people's clothes for money. It's obviously been highly successful for you.
Bank teller's just a start. I got plans. Real plans. Not opening some Zoom-Boom Room. This time next year I'll be a loan officer.
My daddy gave me this watch.
Thanks for backing me up here, Uncle Claude.
You're soft.
Let me get this straight. We drove all the way down to Klan country 'cause you heard a couple of guys talking?
Reward?
She's in a tight spot. Her mama needs this operation, and they ain't got the money for it. Their church took up a collection but they were still short...
What can I say? When the spirit moves me.
Fuck that cheap-ass watch --  I mean, how the hell are we gonna get home without any money?
Life?! How long is life? We were just walking back to the truck. We didn't do nothing! Fuck life!
Why do you think they call him Jangle Leg?
What a second, you've been in here since you were thirteen?
I kinda lost track of how many people we killed that night. Must have been 15 or twenty -- not counting women and children. It was a real bloodbath. All that screaming...
I'm not gonna forget it. What does that mean? If you've got a plan, I think I have a right to know about it. I told you my plan.
You still got that map?
Well, if you're still thinking about booking it, I want in. I think we can make it.
The appeal was denied. Then Daisy went and fell for Maynard. They're engaged to be married, can you believe that?
No.
Does that mean I'm in?
What'd you say?
Come on, Ray, time to go!
Keep it together, Claude. You wake up the man, he'll shoot you for sure.
You can starve to death for all I care. Now shut up, the game's about to start.
What you're dealing with here is a complete lack of talent.
It's a pardon from the governor.
He said they keep it parked out behind the barn. Can't be that hard to fly a plane. Lots of people do it.
My daddy died in prison. He gave up hope and hung himself. What you're talking about is the same damn thing. That ain't how I'm going.
Hey, I'm a lonely old man. I like to talk, too. So why don't we start by talking about what kind of a plan you're working on?
I can't do it.
What'd you say?
Why don't he just tell 'em the truth?
Nurse Humphries was checking my prostate this morning. I got an erection.
Over to the morgue and up the hill to the cemetery. Never thought I'd admit it, Claude, but you were right.
Are you trying to tell me after all this time you finally have a plan for busting out of here?
It's too late for plans.
I can't eat this.
Then you won't have no problem making the adjustment. You need anything, help of any kind, gimme a holler. Name's Jangle Leg.
Can't I get one of those steaks you got grilling back there?
At least he didn't kill Santa Claus with his bare hands.
You got your own nightclub?
Ray, my man, this steak is like butter!
Tell him the state of Mississippi is only interested in getting this ditch cleared by sundown.
Alright, listen up! I want every man lined up out here in the yard on the double! Let's move it!
So it don't exist.
That's right, fellas. Catch any cab heading uptown. All the drivers know Ray's Boom-Boom Room.
You can't go in there, Ray! You'll never make it!
Is there any truth to what he's saying, Pike?
Besides, why bother with bootlegging when we got us a clear cut case of murder?
Yeah, it's special. They don't make 'em like this anymore.
Goldmouth? They say he was born out back behind the shithouse. That's what they say.
Last night? What are you talking about, Ray?
I'm interested. Keep talking.
Adrian, you gotta come back to Hell. Dad's sick.
I am concentrating. Where can we rule?
Eventually, Cassius. But first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them...
You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
No!
And give you a good buzz.
Hello... yes, he's here with me now... I don't know if he's hot, he's my son, you perv! I'll call you back...  Oh my God, I will call you back, goodbye.  That was my friend, Michelle, she says "hi."
Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple cause I'm gonna rock that town like a hurricane.
Where is he? He's late.
Hey... Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!
You'll be alright. Go on. Big day tomorrow. Don't forget to do that sleep thing I told you about.
Go get a soda out of the fridge.
I was with Valerie, I swear. This is Adrian's work. I've got to find him.
Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
Can I take him with me and have sex with his head?
I'm sorry. After careful consideration, I regretfully have to decline.
In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul? You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr. Marino.
Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways. Just go back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the beautiful family and all that.
No, no, that's not what I said. He can keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta go.
Who is this, Metal-lick-a?
I'm lucky to get away with just the head boobs, right?
Hey.
Bus?
You were gone ten seconds. What happened?
I was in love one time but she said I wasn't financially reliable enough. And she needed that.
You sure you're down with this?
Looking for the chief.
Recently, yes! So I run up behind this guy, and start bashing his brains in with this bat, and it made me feel happy! Did you ever see THE UNTOUCHABLES?
I'm not Nicky. I'm not home! I don't live here!
Hello.
So you're saying, make all pants with a drawstring, then heavier set gals don't have to feel humiliated by telling their waist size in front of the whole store?
Hey.
I think I'm floating.
..."The Devil?"...
I never thought I'd ever see Ozzy live until he was dead.  Please tell me you like metal.
Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to fight like that?
Yes. What is rent?
Hey...
We're hungry do you have anything to eat?
There must be somebody else up here. I can't believe that he's --
How did they get in here?
It's a real privilege, Sandman.
You should've seen me take my last Runner... perfect.  I backed him up against a residence pool and when he terminated... his hand...  So now you've seen him... what's the difference awake or asleep?
I just might look in on New You 483 myself.
I never 'killed' anybody in my life. Sandmen terminate Runners.  Who brought you?
You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
I'm not armed.  Well?
What Quad do you live in?
You could have called me yourself.
I couldn't get you out of my mind.
About running, dying what?
And then you killed him, right?
I wish I could help you.
They're like beasts. Wild.
Instead of what? Nine months inside a woman:  We're all raised the same but most of us don't become cubs in Cathedral.
Just follow -- no matter how it seems...
Exactly four steps now. Let me lead you.  Now to the right. It's narrow here, you'll have to get behind me.
Do you think everything's going to turn to ice?
...But I still have the choice...?
They all have names and numbers on them. I wonder what they are?
Look at his face... and his hair...  Is that what it is to grow old?
Do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them?!
Beloved husband...
What does that water do?
I'll make the arrangements.
Goodbye.
I like your face. Would you mind if Doc took a picture? I'd like him to give your face to somebody else.
What kind of place is this?
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
Are you ready to put him in?
No -- just there -- on the first level.  Don't look for us. We'll see you.
Good... You up for a drive?
Just goin' up'ta "Tops"... Maybe the "Ten Pin".
Listen.
Pete... You okay?
I'm, okay... You okay?
Why not?
No.
Now we'll see what this son of a bitch is up to.
I was here yesterday.
Where's your phone? I have to call another taxi.
Sure.
Pete?
So, should I call Andy?
Lemme call him now. Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night.
You killed him.
Look at all this shit... I know a fence... he'll give us money and get us passports in exchange for this and the car...  We can go anywhere.
Dick Laurent?
Mr. Smith has been waiting for you and Mrs. Trueworthy. Can you take care of Mr. Smith now?
Yeah.
The police called us.
Never saw him before in my life.
His condition? What do you mean?
Just rest easy, Pete. You're gonna be okay.
You talk to him?
Did you ask him who he is?
That's not Fred Madison?
Who is it?
Yeah, Mack?
I wouldn't know how.
Pete, can you tell us now, anything about this?
What's the matter?
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
There's no other bedroom?
Did you use the alarm system since we were here last?
What's bothering you, Madison?
The doctor said not to give you anything. You can see him in the morning.
At your house. Don't you remember?
Of course. In fact, I'm there right now.
From the club. You didn't answer.
I had a dream about you last night...
What's that? Another tape?
Did you see that about the guy who chopped up his wife into a million pieces?
They're gonna cook him.
The heart, I guess.
Because if anybody's givin' you trouble, Pete, I can take care of the problem... like that. 
Give that a try.
At sixty?
Hello.
Okay.
Look... It's late, Mr. Eddy... I ...
Last time I saw you.
Whatiya mean, Sheila?
Look Sheila... I'm sorry...
Cable from Gainsford.
All of it?
What about those men we met this morning?
When I get home I shall probably be knighted for it.
Sorry.
Wait a minute, you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone?
Yeah, I remember. You said that before.
Don't call me brother.
I say, good morning, Lovey.
I see.
Wait a minute. Is it a good morning? Say, we're supposed to be traveling east, aren't we?
Well, it looks to me as if we're traveling west.
Where are they? Do you see them?
Look at me. Look at what they gave me to wear.
How about you Lovey? Come on. Let's you and I play a game of honeymoon bridge.
The police?
I don't know why I associate with you, Mr. Barnard - or Mr. Chalmers Bryant - or Mr. Embezzler - or whatever your name may be.
Yeah. You know.
—then the bears came right into the bedroom and the little baby bear said, "Oh, somebody's been sleeping in my bed." And then the mama bear said, "Oh dear, somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" And then the big papa bear, he roared, "And somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" Well, you have to admit the poor little bears were in a quandary!
It's better than freezing to death down below, isn't it?
Hey, hurry up, you slow-pokes - I'm starved!
Yeah. I though you ran this joint.
Think of it! In times like these.
Say, you're an American, aren't you?
And mine's Conway.
Oh, good heavens, no!
Well, it must have taken–
That would suit me perfectly. I'm always broke. How did you pay for them?
Who?
He amputated his own leg?
That's all very fine if it works out. A little amazing, of course.
Please calm yourself. You'll soon be well if you do.
I'm sorry, but we have no doctors here.
What exactly do you mean by "almost any time now"?
Simply preposterous. Do you know what I did last night? Last night, Mr. Chang, I held a sort of a self- inventory. I said to myself last night, Mr. Chang, I said, "Lovey"—  Mr. Lovett! "Mr. Lovett," I said, "you are an ungrateful fool . . . "
Oh, immediately.
We were just going to bury him when you came along.
In that event, we better make arrangements to get some porters immediately. Some means to get us back to civilization.
The High Lama is the only one from whom any information can come.
A fine trick! Smart, aren't you? What a pack of lies you told us about those porters! Of course the minute they arrive, we can make arrangements to leave. If they take us. But you knew very well you'd tell them not to!
Sondra Bizet.
We need men like you here, to be sure that our community will continue to thrive. In return for which, Shangri-La has much to give you. You are still, by the world's standards, a youngish man. Yet in the normal course of existence, you can expect twenty or thirty years of gradually diminishing activity. Here, however, in Shangri- La, by our standards your life has just begun, and may go on and on.
Bob, these are all that are left.
The next time you're in wild country like this, keep in touch with the British Consul.
Oh, stop it!
Of course you would. If ever we get out of this place, the thing for you to do is to take that job with Helen's father.
Well - I mean—
What about the porters?
Something grand and beautiful, George. Something I've been searching for all my life. The answer to the confusion and bewilderment of a lifetime. I've found it, George, and I can't leave it. You mustn't either.
I think you've been hypnotized by a lot of loose-brained fanatics. Why, I wouldn't believe it if I heard it in an English monastery. Why should I swallow it here in Tibet?  How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof?
So everyone is serenely happy in Shangri-La? Nobody would ever think of leaving?  It's all just so much rot! She's pleaded with me ever since I came here to take her away from this awful place. She's cried in my arms for hours, for fear I'd leave her behind. And what's more, she's made two trips to the plateau to bribe the porters - for me!
You say the porters are waiting for us?
Where were you hiding?
No. That's not possible! If we had landed, we all would have been awakened.
That fellow got on at Baskul.
Good.
We'll smash his face in. That's what we'll do.
I guess we're in for it.
As a matter of fact, all I saw was a little boy whistling in the dark.
Perhaps because you've always been a part of Shangri-La without knowing it.
I'm sure of it. Just as I'm sure there's a wish for Shangri-La in everyone's heart. I have never seen the outside world. But I understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy. Yet I just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security, where there's beauty and comfort, where they wouldn't have to be mean and greedy. Oh, I just wish the whole world might come to this valley.
You'll wait till you rot!
Kids' game a couple galaxies over.
Well... you know, when you say "normal," what, exactly...
It'll make sense later?
Sorry, Cowan, I found out literally just before the ceremony.' Apparently you're to report for further review.
Which do you have your money on, Dee?
I wasn't scared...
'Hell, I may as well do something useful.
Well, how about if I guess, then? Black: Vast space.  Deep. Spiritual. The essence of infinity.
The point is to not call attention to ourselves.
It's a bug.
So... lemme get this straight.  We got the use of all sorts of technology from all sorts of other planets.  We got information no one else in the world is privy to.  And we're in a 1986 Ford LTD about to go look at an insect?
I tell you, if we really wanted to bland in, that'd what we'd be wearing.  I think it'd be a good look for you, too.  I'll even help you choose a tattoo.
Well, one thing's for sure.  You could certainly lighten up.
Now what?
A signazoid's eleven thousand pounds. I think we'd know if held left.
Jesus Christ...
Where's it coming?  Where's he landing?
How does that help me?
I know what you're saying.  And I'm telling you I don't trust him--
We saw it in the office.  It went from this big...    to big...   in a day.
It's marble.
Who's she gonna tell, anyway? She only hangs out with dead people.
Right, right-- I like that stuff.
Exactly.  I very much enjoy that.
It's the most amazing insect nest I've ever seen.  And I'll tell you one thing, it sure as hell ain't the Andean Mollatoosa.
What the hell does that mean?
What if you have the foggiest clue as to where the queen is?
Yeah ... ?
Why don't you ask the Mosebacke?     Brazil. Until 44 years ago they ate with their hands, lived in huts, and didn't even know the rest of the world existed. 44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork.  Today, they don't exist.
So... now what?  Cattle call again?
... recent landings within a hundred mile radius of Sudbury, Virginia?
Did our friend announce when he's making his speech?
Wouldn't happen to be the Lincoln Memorial, would it?
In about 10 seconds they're gonna start losing brain cells at the rate of about a million a minute.
We're from Scientific American.  We read about your discovery.  We'd like to take a look.
We're with the immigration and Naturalization Service, Intergalactic Bureau.  We monitor all-alien activity in and around Earth and its enveloping atmosphere.
Kay?  What's your 20?
Hard to tell.  I hope not.
And they're buying it?
Well, it wasn't in the jar...
Every day for the last six years I've thought about only two things. The first was what my son would look like if he were alive today. If I would even recognize him if I saw him on the street.  The second was what I would do to the man who took him.
Please, I want to go back...
Where are we going?
The drowning woman.  Anne... But it was too late.  Her little girl was already gone.
I'm sorry, John, but you have to run again.
-- but he didn't.
I'm so sorry... I just want him back... I want him back so bad...
Don't worry.  I could cut open your chest, sew a dead cat in there and you'd never get an infection.  Not with the spectrum of antibios I'll be shooting into you.
Anesthesia.  Try to relax, John.  I'm saying I'll have to remove your eyes.  Completely.
That's not much.
From where?  D.C.?
Victim's a white female.
Hence the expression...
Which makes this the worst possible time to show that we're only human.
And this is exactly the kind of behavior that will give them an excuse to do it.
If he's looking for a flaw in the system --
This is all Witwer.  He's setting me up.
I'm out of breath!  I'm a fucking fugitive!
John --
Seventeen minutes.
Okay, Jad, what's coming?
We can't grab it...
The mall?
Uh-huh.  Jad?
I've got no address -- last known or otherwise -- no tax returns for the last five years.
You're certain?
The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't change the fact that it was going to happen.
It was Iris Hineman.  She developed the Precogs, designed the system and pioneered the interface.
Are these all of her previsions?
Well, hey, you didn't have to come all the way down here.  For you, Chief, I make housecalls...
She's got information inside of her.  I need you to get it out.
I tell you what.  I do this, I get to keep whatever images I get from her head.
I scored a goal!
I won!
What the hell.
Who are you?
Sean, wait...
It floated back up.  I had to take him out and --
Look, I've put my family through enough misery.  You gotta kill me! This way I can leave 'em something.
Let go of the gun.
You don't seem all that proud.
Heal who?
What?
Jesus Christ -- why didn't I know about this?
You want to bring it down.
You said they're destroyed.
-- and then walk out.
I'll get EYEscanned a dozen times before I get within ten miles of Precrime.  They'll pick me up...
How do I even know which one has it?
But I also know why he married you: you're as stubborn as he is.
All right.  Tell you what I'll do. First thing Monday, I'll look over the Witwer evidence and I'll have Gideon run the Containment files, see if anyone drowned a woman named -- what did you say her name was?
He just wanted a few minutes before --
Shall we call the Attorney General? I'm sure he'd be happy to clarify the issue for you.
I did find it.  It was inside of Agatha all this time.  So the question is, why would someone want this erased from the data file?
Precog Deja Vu...
Near Death's real popular right now, which includes everything from getting hit by a car, to falling off a high building to plane crashes.  It's a big rush, you come out the other side without a heart attack.
Uh, yeah, being concert master of the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra is one of our most popular choices...
The information we need is embedded in the grain of wood.  And since each piece is unique, the shape and grain is impossible to duplicate.
Because of the nature of murder.  "There's nothing more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that binds us than the untimely murder of one human being by another".
Why don't I feel like celebrating?
We could have lunch together.
I don't have any sugar either.
Since right after we lost our son.
Lamar Burgess thinks that you left John because he lost himself in Precrime instead of you.
Maxie wants me to replace you on the job tomorrow. He wants you to come by the office today.
He'll be a minute, hon. You want some coffee?
Now, Mr. Slade, you're in room 315.
Yes, sir.
Not on me, sir.
Are you sure?
What, sir?
All the suites are about the same.
It's as good a suite as we have, unless you want two bedrooms.
I don't get it. What do you do?
You think he don't know? I give him his cut of seventeen hundred, I think he knows I can't make that lap dancing.
It's a poison arrow tree frog.
Uncle Bobby?
I don't know.
Bullshit. These are classy customers. You can't show up all fucked up with a Fila running suit on.
Well, that's not gonna happen.
Ho's a fucking pimp! He encourages Wendy to turn tricks. And she's his fucking wife!
I want you to quit.
Max offered to stake me.
She needs a family. A dad. I'll give her what you never had.
Take her.
Yeah, well you let me know when you wanna start makin the real money.
What's up? Jess ready?
What's up. You all ready to meet Ruiz?
When's it going down?
Now, here's what worries me. He said he wants to meet up at a bar in Red Hook. You know where that is?
Brooklyn.
That it?
This is it.
A million. Easy.
I got a way we make everybody happy.
Ruiz wants to go alone, but it's not up to Ruiz. It's up to me, and I like a sure thing. Just go and we're square on the tooth.
That was before he lost my carpet cleaning van.
I gotta tell you, Mr. Reuben, I'm not comfortable getting in any deeper. It's one thing to look after Jess...
It's not that I don't appreciate the offer...
A bad heart.
Hi. I, uh, think that's us.
No. Just the cross streets.
Sorry, man, but...
What about it?
So, it was a draw.
Yeah. Page me. You know the number?
I do. It's a fuckin Persian Palace.
This is the opportunity of a lifetime. What are you? Nuts? You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
Damn right, I have. You think I like living on fucking Yucca? We do a good job on this, we're in.
We look good this year.
I'll get the girl.
'Cardiff Giant.' That's us.
Great. On my fucking room.
Oh really. Why's that?
I know you're not calling Jimmy.
This is bullshit, man.
What the fuck do you have to complain about?
What the fuck is that supposed --
Well, I thought you understood and I was just missing it.
So is this the drop?
He woulda told us right?
Yeah, me too. You're a fucking bull in a china shop.
Fuck you. Go then. I'm taking the car.
Look who's back? Want some champagne?
He said it's being arranged. He said Jimmy will know.
What are you doing.
Let's do it.
What about it?
Kinda. Yeah.
You want to come splash around.
Cardiff Giant. Just check.
I'll get you the list of videos, if you don't mind, I'll offer the other passengers a beverage.
Yes?
Yes.
Where's Spa.
How do you know it's not drugs?
It means you got a gun?
I'm not saying shit to neither of you.
Dude, you just gotta settle your shit down. You gotta go and say all that 'Red Dragon' shit. Make him think he's on Barretta.
Ow, shit...
I'm half Irish.
Coke?
No, really, mate?
Good morning.
Ricky.
So you're our own private guy?
I don't know. I thought you might. Any idea what the job is?
A lot of Persians?
Nigger, please. Don't even order that artichoke shit. West side guineas. Forget the drinks, Leo. We gotta roll. What do I owe you?
dollars in c-notes, a numeric pager, a double-A battery, and a first class round-trip ticket to JFK.
Yeah.
I get it.
So, we're talking money laundering...
Yeah.
What they call you?
Why?
I like your heart and I like your style. You might just do, Little. Lessen you got to git back to that train job.
How's it feel?
You're a damn liar.
Take it easy. Lay down and don't think about it.
The dirty yellow rat bastard.
Man, what do you want?
Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. You got some more?
Putting all that poison in your hair.
Leggo. I got to wash it out.
Sure, burn yourself, pain yourself, put all that poison into your hair, into your body -- trying to be white.
I respect myself. A man cuss because he hasn't got the words to say what's on his mind.
What? Everybody knows God is White.
What the hell for, man?
Then what you telling me to study in them for?
Aardvark, noun. An earth pig; an ant- eating African mammal. Man, that sounds like the dozens.
I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
What can I do for you?
Make it plain.
Women talk too much. To tell a woman not to talk is like telling Jesse James not to carry a gun or a hen not to cackle. And Samson, the strongest man that ever lived, was destroyed by the woman who slept in his arms.
Sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice cream soda.
Oh, yes, there is. I know a lot about you. Brother Bembry briefed me.
There's a few things you don't know about women, Brother Malcolm. They're possessive and vain.
It will be rough.
I just want to sit here and be still.
Families shouldn't be separated. I'll never make another long trip without you and the kids. We'll all be together.
Stop calling us. Leave us alone. Leave us alone. I'll kill you. I'll kill you.
Malcolm, they keep calling, threatening us. I'm going crazy, when is this going to stop?
Dear heart, where are you?
Brother Earl.
Let's cancel.
They were Hebrew, weren't they?
What color were the original Hebrews?
Now just a moment, just a moment --
No, each of us must relearn that work is the only worthwhile thing. Allah has given you a great gift. Use it wisely, never forgetting that we are nothing, while He is all.
I thought you said we were going to the movies last night.
And like a fool I believe it.
But our crime wasn't burglary. It was balling white girls. They gave us the book.
Baby, I'll call you tomorrow.
Malcolm, you can be anything you want. You got class and you're smart.
-- there is a serious question as to whether --
How many you turning out?
You're my father.
You the man.
You had the number.
Except she live on the hill and got a grandma.
Bang, bang. You're dead.
I forgot to tell you I'm wearing a bulletproof vest.
Jesus, Red, she's just a kid.
Palmed it right in the goddam chamber.
Baby, I love you. Take it easy, greasy. How about a snort?
Yes, I am, Brother Minister. All I want is support for my children. He should provide for his children. That's all I want.
What am I doing here?
My family lives in Miami. Because of the death threats.
I want to arrest you for murder! I want to shake your hand and reload your gun! I want to kill my pride and give you my blessing.
You have no interest in making things easy, do you?
[Where are you staying in Mexico?]
[Why?]
[Senor?]
I need the name and address of the owner of a Toyota Corolla, license number ME31704... We didn't get the last digit so I need the ten possible matches.
[We page him and he calls back on this cell phone.]
[What is his name?]
[How does it work?]
[Who pays you?]
[What's the PIN number?]
[Who killed her? You?]
[No offense, but I'm sorry that your profession needs to exist.]
[Do you know who I am?]
[Two million U.S.... Three million U.S.?]
[Yeah.  Yes.]
[The girl's. Pinta's.]
[Do you know who I am? I am the commandante of the Judicial anti- kidnapping division.]
What is it?
Is it loaded?
When did Mexican Customs start getting smart?
So how's business?
But don't you stay in El Paso?
You been working?
Well, you'd have to keep it under control.
What are you doing here?
There's still ink on my fingers from last week.
Then one day, he calls and says, 'I'm in love and I'm moving to Mexico.' I said what happened to the plan?
Stomach's gone. But... okay.
Do you like dogs, Mr. Creasy?
That's 'Bird.' Emilio forgot to take him with when he left.
No.
No.
Potential? I don't understand.
Are you going to quit? My last bodyguard quit.
We're taking a different way home.
Did you like school, Creasy?
Pinta, do you have a pencil?
I don't think they're broken. Anywhere else?
Do you always sleep with him?
Why do you ask?
You feel sorry for the husband?
What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes?
Remember you asked me what state I was from?
You're late.
Could I ask you a question?
I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.
Pinta, we've got to go. Travel sucks at this time.
Don't be a baby. You're tougher than that.
Continue to play in the wrong key, like you're dyslexic.
You're American.
You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.
Jordan!
Creasy... Wait.
Last night. Do you know something?
If she pisses you off, you get another one.
Of course I care about Pinta. She'll be as beautiful as her mother one day.
All my clients have kidnap and ransom insurance.
I know you need to please Lisa. An ass like that is hard to find. Good bodyguards are even harder.
[You have the money.]
I think he's been sick. He's alright now, but I think he's been very, very sick.
I'll call you from Detroit, baby.
My wife, Mr. Creasy.
She likes him.
Pinta likes him too much.  She thinks of him as a father.
[Then what do you have to lose?]
[When you talked to him, did he look sane?]
You helped him get this job.
So what do you feel like doing tonight?
I gotta pains in my shoulder too. I have a pain in my hip, and my right arm aches so much I can't sleep. It's a curse to be old. How you feel?
What they say?
Well, what Marty you think is gonna be here in this house with a girl?
Well, that's all. You will see. Today, tomorrow, inna week, he's gonna say to you, "Hey, Ma, it's no good being a single man. I'm tired-a running around." Then he's gonna say, "Hey, Ma, wadda we need this old house? Why don't we sell this old house, move into a nicer parta town? A nice little apartment?"
You come up here often?
Yeah.
Oh, I cry all the time, any little thing. My brothers, my brother-in- laws, they're always telling me what a goodhearted guy I am. Well, you don't get goodhearted by accident. You get kicked around long enough, you get to be a real professor of pain. I know exactly how you feel. And I also want you to know I'm having a very good time with you now and really enjoying myself. So you see, you're not such a dog as you think you are.
I'm twenty-nine years old. How old are you?
...you teach chemistry? That's funny. Where? What school?
You gotta real nice face, you know? It's really a nice face.
Well, I wouldn't call it an elegant profession. It's in a lower social scale. People look down on butchers.
I think you're kidding yourself, Clara. I used to think about moving out, you know? And that's what I used to say. "My mother needs me." But when you really get down to it, that ain't it at all. Actually, you need your father. You know what I mean? You're living at home, and you got your father and mother there, and you can go on like that -- being a little girl all your life.
Oh, you won't be so lonely. You'll make friends right away.
Marty...
No...
Waddaya doing New Year's Eve?
You got an elevator in this house?
Couldn't she find some sort of hobby to fill out her time?
You don't think my sister Catherine should live in her daughter-in-law's house?
Where do you think a mother-in-law should go?
Well, maybe that's what they teach you in New York University. In real life, it don't work out that way. You wait till you are a mother.
And that husband of hers is a skinny bit of a fellow, isn't he?
Oh, that's a sad story. And her husband is that little fellow, works in Peter Reeves.
Boy, beautiful day, hey, Thomas?
Sure. This girl said...
Hello, Ma.
Ma, I'm gonna stay home and watch Jackie Gleason.
How'd you come home, Ma? Thomas give you a ride?
Did you offer the young lady some fruit?
She's more than twenty-nine years old, Marty. That's what she tells you.
Don't bring her to the house no more.
...I been talking about two nurses Leo and me picked up in a bar on Seventy-First Street.
Your kid brother got married last Sunday, eh, Marty?
That's the big tall one, the fellow with the moustache.
Sure.
No, Virginia, I know how you feel.
Listen, let's go downa Kaplans' apartment. They told us to come down.
What about the time she wanted to make an old-fashioned Italian dinner for my brother, but you wouldn't let her!?
How they goin', Losing Preacher? What do you hear from the Pope?
I believe it takes both. I'd have to look it up.
I may need you to go to work practically immediately. But meanwhile perhaps you'd like to meet some of your fellow officers.
Yeah, maybe move that nurse in. She don't seem the type to keep you awake praying.
What are you going to do with him?
Okay, I'm a witness, but how do you prove who's right?
You – must – open – me – up – again?
But first will you please kindly shut the goddam door?
Wisconsin.
What?
You got directions?
No, Hawkeye just said it all.
Never mind. Forget it.
Where the hell we going to get us a football team?
Never heard of him.
How come nobody knows about him? And you do?
I thought we were heading for trouble putting on all these trinkets.
But no short-arm inspection. I'm with you there.
Let's hear from you, you goddam Yankee. Be nice to see you some time.
I think it's a marvelous letter.
Ravenous. What about you?
Frank...
Wait a second...
You betcher ass, Dad.
Well, Dad, we haven't found any holes in the large bowel. They've all been in the small bowel, but the smell is different. I caught a whiff of large bowel, but it ain't staring us in the face, right?
And there it is.
Oh, certainly, Sergeant. My name is Captain George Limburger, and this is Captain Walter Camembert.
I think I've seen this nut somewhere.  Haven't I?
That's the front up the road a few miles. We have to get by without some of the comforts of home.
We're throwing him a Last Supper. We came to invite you.
Or you can let him knock himself out. You personally'd be sending him to his grave.
Very well, Your Majesty.  Congratulations, Frank. He picked you.
Let me translate. I've had some exposure to the language. The young man is from Brooklyn and he wants us to vacate this vehicle.
Look.
Christ, it's Ho-Jon!
If we squeeze him through, I'm going to get him into Androscoggin College.
He only lasted one season.
Might make kind of a social issue, not having any other Negro officer.
Captain, I've been observing the nurses on your shift. But naturally your own opinion is more informed than mine.
All of them?
I've noticed that both nurses and enlisted men address you as 'Hawkeye.'
What's the matter?
How did you get called that?
You're an attractive man.
I don't make the distinction. But the sex urge is a powerful force. In women just as much as men.
It's terribly hard. Sometimes the temptation is just too much.
I couldn't have slept tonight anyhow.
I don't liking it at all, what I hear when I listen to the heart. And such a blood pressure for so young a boys. Is frightening.
At first is no doubt. But then I am seeing on his paper he work in American hospital. And I think there are so many drugs in such a places, he could take some by mistake.
You really say the cutest things.
They missed the boat.
The real Trapper John? The one who threw you the famous pass and went to greater glory on the Boston and Maine Railroad?
What do you do in the joint besides pimp?
What's wrong with him?
No, never in the slightest.
In the direction you want to go.
Good morning, Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest.
I have not understood what you means.
You don't aim to cause any trouble – But?
I should fire him because he got in the way of Trapper's fist? No. I've put up with a lot from you guys, but now I finally have to take disciplinary action.
What's going on? Who started this?
If you say so, Henry. But remember my claustrophobia.
O'Reilly!
O'Reilly, what is it?  There aren't more choppers coming?
We've got too many wounded for us to handle now! Get on the phone right away and...
Thank you, Spearchucker. I'll certainly take a look at these. Where the hell did you ever get that name?
Morning, girls. Good morning Major.
This one goes right to the OR. Tell Duke to do him ahead of the busted spleen.  And this kid can't wait. I'll take him myself, before I get to that ruptured diaphragm.
What's the bastard really like?
Soup? Rice? What are we doing, beginning all over again?
Would you be willing to say you wrote that letter—and stick by it?
Don't mind the Colonel. He hates people.
Action?
Yes!
Look, John. Something terribly important's happened. They're forming John Doe Clubs. We know of eight already and they say that there's going—
Oh, but you don't know how big this thing is. You should see the thousands of telegrams we've received and what they're saying about you.
You know, I had a crazy dream last night. It was about you.
But here's the funniest part of it all. I was the fella up there doing the marrying. You know, the Justice of the Peace or something . . .
How many people do you think we've talked to already, outside the radio, I mean?
Go ahead, driver! Ball park!
Hello. Whenever there's a pretty woman around, er—  This is my nephew, Ted Sheldon, Miss Mitchell.
Better let me talk to him.
Stick a fork through me! I'm done. I'll never get this speech right.
Yeah, I know. What are you looking for?
Oh, I'm sorry, Ma. Oh, don't pay any attention to me. I guess I'm just upset about all this. Gee whiz, here I am with a great opportunity to get somewhere, to give us security for once in our lives, and I'm stuck. If I could put this over, your Mrs. Burke can have six babies!
What?
There's enough in it for a hundred speeches, things people ought to hear nowadays. You be careful of it, won't you dear?  It's always helped keep your father alive for me.
No. I've had the whole army and navy searching for you because that's a game we play here every day.
The letter from John Doe.
Very pretty. Very pretty, indeed, Miss Mitchell. But would you mind telling me who goes on Christmas Eve?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Lemme get this through this lame brain of mine. Are you suggesting we go out and hire someone to say he's gonna commit suicide on Christmas Eve? Is that it?
Looks all right—
Well, maybe you're right.
Thinks it's terrific. Says for us to go the limit. Wants us to build a bonfire under every big shot in the state.
Now listen, Ann—he can't possibly get in without our seeing him. I'm watching the side door and the Colonel's out front, so stop worrying.
Well, nobody asked yuh.
Has he been here?
No sense in going up there! I been here for hours. He ain't here!
Hello! . . . Yeh?
Hey, boss. Get a load of this.
Yeah, Boss?
Hey, wait a minute, Mr. Doe!
Hey, whatsa matter with a bank account, anyway?
And when they get you, you got no more chance than a road-rabbit.
A what?
Hey, pretty nifty, huh?
Gimme mine. I ain't staying! You know we were headed for the Columbia River country before all this John Doe business came up. You remember that, don't yuh?
Now, that's all right, isn't it?
You must be wrong, Mr. Connell, 'cause he's been marvelous about the John Doe Clubs.
All right! Now, supposing a certain unmentionable worm, whose initials are D. B., was trying to use that to shove his way into the White House. So he could put the screws on, so he could turn out the lights in those lighthouses. What would you say about that? Huh?
Only one thing to do, Hank. Drop the whole business quickly.
What's your name?
Now, hold on a minute, young man! Hold on! That's rather big talk! I started the John Doe clubs with my money and I'll decide whether or not they're being properly used!
That's a lie! Listen—don't believe what he says . . .
Yes! I was paid! But the—
Listen, folks, it's a fact that I didn't write the letter, but this whole thing started—
I bet you he'd know how to say it all right. And me, I get up to it and around it and in back of it, but, but I never get right to it. Do you know what I mean? So the only chance I've got is, well, if somebody could kinda give her a warning sort of, sorta prepare her for the shock!
Have you got the speech I gave you?
A sea-gull? What's a sea-gull doing around the city hall? That's a bad omen, isn't it? 
I don't know.
Not that we know of.
This SWAT guy might be a good idea. He may be able to take a little pressure off you. I worry about you.
Apartment 306.
Not the fucking cop that showed up at my door!
God damn it! I still needed to case that fucking store. It's too risky to show my face now.
I won't get away with it.
This has nothing to do with Walter.
Tell my dad.
I hate fucking Springfield.
Really?
Who are you again?
Hold on a second here.
You signed out twice.
The suspect came in shortly after the bank opened. Botched robbery. A teller hit the silent alarm. He took seven hostages. Shot one -- the guard. He's still alive. So far he's asked for...
That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesn't...
Are you in charge, Roper?
You can't kill me like this.
Don't go reading my lips, man. That's an intrusion. Save that shit for the sniper school. Comprende?
What's the point of this?
You got a girlfriend?
You wouldn't want to put a small wager on this, would you?
Yeah, I've got a girlfriend.
Where did you hear that?
Nah, I just throw that in because I enjoy it.
You know the ten commandments?
To save lives.
My name's McCall. I'm unarmed.
What did you see?
So what do you want?... An autograph.
I'm just practicing my lying.
See this. Solis has me driving the shit-mobile, and he picked this up straight out of impound for fourteen grand. Probably worth thirty.
What the fuck is going on.
You're crazy.
Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them.
How many have you lost?
And what if you can't live with it?
Roper. Metro Division. Hostage Negotiator. Give me the short version.
Ray, if you walk out of here with me, I'll get you a job.
This baseball player you're going out with...  He's no good for you.
I worship you.
Please. I'm begging you.
Hey.
Maybe you should be.
Something I guess I can't have anymore.
You like this place?
Korda escaped.
Scottie?
Hmm?
Yeah.
Stay up there, Girl...
Are you going to make this hard for me?
What if you die and no one can do what you do as well as you do it?
And a car.
You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound.
Any verification on numbers.
This is Halden.
What do you want?
She said I have a son...
That's a strange question.  You a strange man?
Do you believe in miracles?
The guests are here.
What's happening?
Divinity?
But what if he doesn't --
Where you plugged-in from?
Take care.
Two maze runners.
The only way to eject it is from the inside.
Who did he digitize?
What did he tell you?
There was no need to kill her.
An interface attendant.
Insurance?
Then how do you know about --
Most nights you wake up crying. Never knowing why.
That's why they told you you can't go inside.  They can't have you running into her.
But I don't know anything about programming.
I wasn't with you.
Don't know what you're talking about.
My uni-net account.  I log on.  The program's there.
Program name?
Access granted.  Male or female?
Rangers...  I'm afraid you're too late.
Is this... food!
Wow.  Sand.
Let's teach these vermin a few manners.
In a place that came to be known as Angel Grove.
To assist you I have retro-fitted your helmets with new Opti-Scan devices.
It is said that to those who possess the Power... all things are possible.
I see... a fox
That's the only way to the Monolith...
... Nothing.
THREE DEGREES OFF THE COMETS TRAJECTORY!
009843... 42... 41!  WE'RE IN ALIGNMENT!
Let's go after him!!
I'm in!
IMPACT IN FIFTEEN SECONDS!
Bulk... why don't we give Mr. Peep here a chance to think it over?
There goes the neighborhood.
SKULL!!
And how do we release the power?
As soon as we've taken over the world I'm gonna change my name to Sir Mordant.  Or how about MAJOR Mordant?!
But boss, what about their parents?
THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN!!!
That's right.  And then we threw one of them off a mountain and another one into a raqing river!
What is THAT!
There seems to be some confusion about your registration. I believe I can find you a place at the Ambassador. Many persons of the Jewish faith find it quite...
I'm sorry, sir. Our clientele is restricted to White Anglo-Saxons.
What you're sayin' makes a lotta sense. Ya know, if I keep on killin' people like I have, I won't have no more friends left!
Torrio ain't like them guys. He thinks like an American. You'd like him, Charlie. He'd like you.
You ever been near a meat packing plant? My father makes a couple million per, but the smell in his office is enough to make you puke.
What do you mean?
I ain't mad. I ain't even surprised. But I can't let ya fuck me. On the other hand, if ya got needs beyond the thirty-five, I'll advance it to you against our next deal on the same terms.
They told me you wanted to talk about this Shane business.
Mad Dog Coll's in town on a job.
How much longer we gotta be shut up in this fuckin' sweatbox?
You ain't even a man yet.
No disrespect, Tommy, but why would Mr. Arnold Rothstein wanna do business with bums like us?
Come on. It's Christmas. At least stay for breakfast.
Would it be painful for you?
Charlie, I'm from the old country, and these American ways get me sometimes confused. You tellin' us you refuse the title of Boss of All the Bosses?
Julius Caesar never took no vote.
Bugsy, you and I don't need to be in business with Maranzano. We got more jobs than we can handle. That's not the problem.
We'll figure out something.
Married? To Anna?  You ain't got her in trouble?
Like Don Maranzano.
I'll handle the Boss.
After all this time I'd think you'd know me better, Meyer.
You're getting' 10 cc's
If ever I need a Boss, Joe.
I like that.
You boys carryin' pieces?
I got a place for you. In my family... or in the cemetery.
This business is about taking risks.
So fuck him. I don't care anymore. Let him come.
You get fifteen percent.
Your Calabrian friend, I will accept. At least Costello eats pasta like us.
Conditions have changed. Some people have become too powerful.
At first, it will hurt you. But you will come to understand and we will be strong together.
Salvatore. Always holding himself above.
The terms will be mine.
Why didn't you tell me that Maranzano had made you an offer?
The Big Picture.
Masseria's scared. He might make our deal.
What a cozy little scene.
Know something Tommy? You're a mensch.
Best we got.
Monkeybone?
Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull.
Jeez, it all looks like bad late-night cable.
Back? You're sending me back?
Death! Thank you!
Herb, it's too much. It's all out of hand.
Oh my God...you're proposing?
It's a special kind of party. A <u>farewell</u> party. Do you...get what I'm saying?
Guys, I don't mean to be rude, but I only have eleven hours and fifty-three minutes to...
Oh, baby, I can't believe you're back.
Meaning me, of course. I'm referring to myself. You have to assume Monkeybone would be a pretty lucrative franchise...
Bitchin' good cake.
We'll hop a plane tonight. An island ceremony. An Abba Dabba honeymoon!
It was you who got the standing O. It was you drawing on the belly over there...
How was it? I don't recall.
An hour ago. <i></i> I tried to prepare myself, but I didn't know he would be like, like <u>this</u>. I can't even bear to look at him... How about you? You're okay?
Kimmy! What's the matter?
You're such a beautiful man. Look at you - stuck in this place, and only thinking of her.
Don't ask where I got it.
Then you can learn to act normally. I had to!
I'm reportin' this to my union!!
I left my phone number in your undies. Try not to lose it in traffic.
<u>He</u> got an E-ticket. Where's mine? <u>When do I get</u> <u>to wake up</u>??
Y'call that art? Why, my three-year-old can paint better than that.
You gotta talk me into it. You'll screw up on your own. I mean, a guy's gotta have a <u>sidekick</u>. For moral support! Wisecracks - snappy banter - <i></i> It's the land of Death, Stu, the Land of Death! Don't go in there without your comedy relief!!
Oh, let me get out of your way then.
Excuse me, sir.  I just wanted to thank you for helping me get into my building yesterday.
The motorcycle gang?  Don't they deal drugs and rape young girls?
Don, this is my mother.  Mom, this is my boss, Don Palmer.
Yeah ... turned out to be a real jerk.
Mother!
You know, you ought to come out to South Dakota some time and meet my son, Steve. He's single.
Where to?
I'm from South Dakota.  Where are you from?
Ohhh.  Do you know the East Village?
This is one-way street.  You go down the block to the middle.
The Majority Leader? Right over there. And that's [           ] the Minority Leader. They're both pretty good in the clinches.
Right up there over the Vice- President's chair--the four in the front row represent the four big news services. You've met the press bunch, haven't you?
Look out for those fellows--they tell the truth about you--sometimes. That corner over there is reserved for guides and sightseers who come in for five minutes to rest their feet. That section over there is reserved for Senator's friends. The front row--the empty one--is for the President and White House guests-- see that old couple over there-- they've attended every session for the last twenty years. Over the clock back here is the Diplomatic section. They and the page boys are the only real class we have in this place. The rest are mostly people who come here like they go to the zoo--
I'll take your hat into the cloak room.
Then--this is *not* you signature, Senator?
Positively not in the station! Gone!
Now, you've gone and let Don Quixote in here again. I told you to keep him out!
Diz--
Any time.
You--you've been a good egg, Diz. Maybe we could clear out of this town--get to feel like *people*--get the habit of lifting up our eyes-- live like we just got out of a tunnel.
No! I can't think of anything more sappy!)
Where?
I case you don't know--I want to give ya a chance to back out if you don't like it--
Don't say "okay," Diz. Say you think it's beautiful.
I won't take it! See? I won't be party to murder. See? Steering a poor dope up blind alleys for that grafting Taylor mob is low enough. But helping that dame cut him up in little pieces besides--nobody's gonna make me do that. No, sir.
Come on--don't pull that. You know you'd give your right--. What are you staying away from him for?
Dinner, Hubert.
Emma, which is it--Horace Miller or Henry Hill?
Terrific! A born stooge! Horace'll perform like a trained seal.
He's batty!
They put up *their* candidate? Who?
*You won't?*
Yes! He's about to blow the whole machine to smithereens--and *you with it*, Mr. Governor!
Well--yes--I was saying--the State should reward you--
He's the greatest *American* we got, too, Dad. Can tell what George Washington said--by heart. An' "Boy Stuff's" got the swellest stuff in it.
No, *sir*! You couldn't do better, Dad.
Well--it started with a little mimeograph sheet--and it's just grown out of all sense and reason--
Washington!
My pigeons--I better see about my pigeons.
Here they are--I got them. They are all right.
I addressed the Chair first, sir!
Thank you, sir.
Ma's told me about it a thousand times.
I'm sorry! Gee! I hope--
But--there are a hundred other places in the state that *need* the water. Besides--I talked to Kenneth Allen, who owns some of that land--and he didn't say anything about a dam. No-- I'm sure, sir--there's something wrong--and I--I won't vote on this thing until I get a lot of questions answered--
Ah, now, that's better.
Will the Senator--
Mr. President--I did not say that Senator Paine was one of those Congressmen I saw. If the chair please, I will deny that Senator Paine *saw* Taylor or even knows him--
Good evening, sir. I was just making some--  Governor Hopper!
Yes, Ma?
Certainly would, Joseph.
I don't believe I've been so thrilled in my--oh, and that Lincoln Memorial! Gee! There he is--Mr. Lincoln--looking right at you as you come up the steps-- sitting there like he was waiting for someone to come along--
The Capitol Dome! Lighted up!
I had a lot to do with that little press conference last night--
Pardon?
--that's the main idea, Miss Saunders. The United States Government isn't going to buy or build this camp-- just lend us the money. You've made a note of that, huh?
Saunders. That's better.  Good morning, Saunders. Hello, Saunders. How's the bill coming, Saunders--?
Letitia.
Susan! Susan Paine--that's beautiful--
You--don't know it, do you?
No--not today! Boy, I feel like a house afire! Saunders--how did I do?
*Gentlemen*! Gentlemen are supposed to believe in something decent. Instead of twisting facts and making a joke of everything--why don't you tell the people the *truth* for a change?
Whoa! Hold it! Pipe down! Come on, now--that's enough of that.
How--how do you do, Miss Paine?  I--I apologize for looking like this-- I--I have to be going now--
Oh, the bill. Oh--splendid--I mean--  I--I just can't seem to talk in this suit.  I'll tell you a secret. It's brand new.
I don't understand, sir! I don't know what the gentleman--
"I do solemnly swear--that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States--against all enemies, foreign and domestic--that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same--that I take this obligation freely--without and mental reservation and purpose of evasion-- and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God."
However, Senator Smith is still a member of this Body and as such has equal claim on the attention of the Chair--
Since the time of Adams--not Washington.
One moment, friends, let's give the Senator a break.  Now, where'd you say you studied law?
Ax?
Whaddaya mean! What did *I* have to do with it? I don't blame the guy.  Wow! Twenty-four hours in this town and nothing but dog-fights! And things aren't bad enough--last night I have to get a run-around from some wise dame--
The Head Man's writing a Bill.
You can't find it in racing forms, Chick.
Here, Jeff, I'll advance it for you.-- Fine introduction to the nation's capital!
Joe! You *told* him to!
Be quiet, Chick--I'm trying to think--  This Deficiency Bill is going to be read in the Senate tomorrow.
I know that.
That won't work, Chick. This boy's honest, not stupid.
My daughter isn't here to carry out assignments like that for *anybody*.
Who? Who? Your boss! A nut, huh? A nut! Wow! There's a *story* in this guy--! I smelled it!
No--I'm sorry. I merely saw him home. I'm not supposed to tuck him in and give him his bottle. That's McGann's job.
Yes. He went to Mount Vernon to give himself a patriotic address.
And I'm an old hand at following instructions--
Why don't you do it yourself?
Well--me, too!
Joe, that's coming a long way in twenty years since I met you practising law down there in Main Street.
We can't drop it now, Joe. We bought the land around this Dam and we're holding it in dummy names. If we drop it or delay it--we are going to bring about investigations, and investigations will show that we own that land and are trying to sell it to the State under phoney names. No, Joe, in my judgment the only thing to do is push this Dam through--and get it over with.
Steamroller stuff, Joe? My methods don't go in Washington? They've done pretty well by now, haven't they?
Well, what do you want me to do? Stand around like you chump and let that drooling infant wrap that Willet Creek Dam appropriation around my neck. Either he falls in line with us and behaves himself or I'll break him so wide open they'll never be able to find the pieces.
Oh, I see. Out steamroller methods are getting too hard to your sensitive soul, is that it, Joe? The Silver Knight is getting to big for us. My methods have been all right for the past twenty years, Joe, since I picked you out of a fly-specked hole in the wall and blew you up to look like a Senator, and now you can't stand it. Well, maybe you won't have to stand it, Joe. Maybe we can fix it so you and your Boy Ranger can go home together.
Here, here, Susan--this is Jeff Smith-- our new Senator.
How nice.
Do I actually *see* this--?
Mr. President...
Senator Paine will state it!
I accuse this man--by his tone--by his careful denials--he is deliberately trying to plant damaging impressions of my conduct--! *I'll* tell you why we were in tht room. Because Mr. Taylor, a respected citizen of our State, had brought with him the evidence against this man, later presented from this floor, and *we were urging him to resign*-- !
Order!
Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?
I say, my friend, do you know a fellow by the name of Longfellow Deeds?
For no reason, I guess. He always does it. We always run into the house when we see him coming.
Why, you own it, Longfellow.
Are you married?
All right, Mr. Dodsworth. I think you'll qualify.  Take this to that desk over there for further instructions.
You are under oath, Miss Bennett. I ask you again - are you employed by the Morning Mail?
Did you subsequently write a series of articles about him?
Were you present when all these things took place?
Oh, thank you!
No, thank you. I'll be all right.
There you are. Grant's Tomb. I hope you're not disappointed.
Oh, I don't know.
I'd rather have Mandrake Falls.
Really?
I've often thought about going back.
In a day or so, I think.
What's up, Babe? Something's eating you.
You haven't gotten very far, have you? That's where you were an hour ago. Come on, let's knock off and go down to Joe's. The gang's waiting for us.
Uh-huh.
Oh, he's not getting away with anything.
Cinderella Man! That's sensational, Babe! Sensational!
What're you going to do?
That's the rub.
It don't look as though we're gonna get any pictures tonight.
Will you show Mr. Hallor to the front door?
Cobb's right. I mustn't talk to anybody.
Who? Miss Dawson?
How is this, sir?
It's a lie!
Hang up.
I can understand that.  We'll take a walk around town, meet you at the train at four o'clock.  Congratulations, Mr. Deeds. You're one of the richest men in the country. We'll see you later.  Goodbye and thank you.
I can't find him.
Look!
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Are your parents living?
Mr. Cobb here is an ex-newspaperman associated with your uncle for many years - as a sort of buffer.
Come in, please. Come in. Can I get you a cup of tea?
Sit down. Sure I couldn't get you a glass of lemonade or something?
Name your poison and I'll supply it.
Did you see all this stuff in the papers?
And what'd you do to those bodyguards? They quit this morning. Said you locked them up.
I don't remember. "Cinderella Man!" What do they mean by that?
I think I'll go down and punch this editor on the nose.
If they're going to poke fun at me, I'm going to—
She's the star reporter on The Mail. Every time you opened your kisser, you gave her another story. She's the dame who slapped that monicker on you - "Cinderella Man." You've been making love to a double dose of cyanide!
You shouldn't be running away like this. What's going to happen to the Estate?
I'm Chairman?
The wrong kind! There isn't any wrong or right kind. Opera is opera!
Well, we were rather expecting it to come from you.
Yeah - that's all that's worrying you. What do I want?  A chance to feed a wife and kids! I'm a farmer. A job! That's what I want!
Common-law wife. On top of that, there's a child.
Yes, sir.
Of course, we don't want to appear greedy, Mr. Deeds.
Yes. Have you any peculiar characteristics when you are creating?
Your Honor—
Proceed.
Mr. Deeds, you haven't yet touched upon a most important thing. This rather fantastic idea of yours to want to give away your entire fortune. It is, to say the least, most uncommon.
Who are they?
No, he's too fussy for that. That's what's the matter with him. There are lots of nice girls right here in Mandrake Falls who're dying to be married—
Hear what he said? You know how much twenty million is?
What is your name?
Farmer?
Where is your farm?
You mean—  —by the neck or something?
Goodnight. Don't worry. I won't keep her out late.
Tails tonight, sir?
No, sir.
He talks about women as if they were cattle.
Tell me, Walter, are all those stories I hear about my uncle true?
Yes, sir.
She was a lady in distress. She wouldn't let me help her. Got a lot of pride. I like that.
You kept searching me last night, sir. Going through my pockets. You said you were looking for a rhyme for Budington.
Madame Pomponi. She says everything is all set for the reception.
But she's on the telephone—
Why, that's an echo, sir!
Shall I call the police, sir?
What do they want from me?  What have I done that's so wrong?  They act as though they don't have their own peculiar things... They do! Believe me. Everybody's got something...  Even you probably have things.
Oh, all the great writers -- Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Moby Dick... those people. Each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents. It's a magnificent set -- and only $33.50 per volume. Right away you get Great Expectations for just $6.99.
It's irrelevant. It had nothing to do with what happened.
We argued on Sunday. He went to work on Monday and stayed in the city during the week, like always. But on Thursday, when he normally comes home, he didn't. Didn't call either. Not till Saturday afternoon.
I know my time's up, but I've got to get this out while I've got hold of it --
You can go out there if you like...
Dr. Mumford.
It's my daughter Sofie... she's gotta problem.
Oh... a lot of things. Several different factors. Will you see her, Doctor Mumford?
I'm not sure she'll come. She's in a mood. Do you ever go to somebody's house?
Hello, Mr. Cook. I was wondering if Sofie was around?
Thank you.
Dr. Delbanco. It's nice to see you again.
My mentor was an amazing teacher named Benton Mandlebaum. Died quite tragically in the collapse of a gazebo.
Dr. Sheeler is leaving Mumford? I'm sorry to hear that.
No?
What is it?
-- and you told me that. Still, there's some kind of imagery that's haunting you and, I think, getting in your way --
My guess is these images were burned into your brain when you were young. Maybe if we could nail down the exact fantasies that are haunting you -- maybe you could get past them... Anyway, I thought we could try an experiment.
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing? I want to know what's in here.
It's all right, it won't bite you. Under civil code 1294.67b you are entitled to be notified that your status and certification are being reviewed. This is the notice.
What brought this on?
Fill in the blank. I don't mind the office. The point is, you only go 'round once. Like the Zens say -- Be here now.
Althea hasn't told you?
No... I mean about Althea. About her...  ...behavior. Do you think you can fix her up?
Clarence Norman White, do you understand how serious are the crimes with which you have been charged?
What?
Are you disrespecting this court, Mr. White?
Meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or salad nicoise.
You're early... it's not ready. What happened?
How long you been in this town?
But you know how to drive?
I just got my license two weeks ago.
I think you know what I mean.
Wow. You're something.
Well, look who's here...
Just who is here, can you tell me?
Sofie. It's so obvious... you're after my daughter.
Even if you don't think it's real?
Mom's such a cutie.
I'm embarrassed. The list is so long.
Sore throat?
I don't know if I mentioned the headaches.
No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache.
You're purposely making me talk while we do this...  ...because you think this is good for me...  ...and you're a sadistic bastard...
That was really bad, wasn't it?
And he's where?
When I was in high school we used to come up here and make out. I liked to sit on the rock and watch the sun go down.
I can't tell you how much I admire you. You have a wonderful way with people. And you're very insightful. I feel like you've seen me clearly... I never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was. You've made that possible for me.
You're shockingly honest, that's what makes you great. I've never had a man treat me this way. With you, I feel really... listened to.  Can I tell you something? It's a little embarrassing, but I feel very unguarded with you.
It might've been more appropriate if we had followed a traditional approach to the doctor-patient relationship.
Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. Mumford.
Sofie...
...How violated I feel?
...so he already had the tattoo that said, "Naomi Forever"... and now they're broken up, see, and he has to have it removed. But while the scar is still healing, or whatever you call it when you have a tattoo removed, he meets Chandra. And it's serious, immediate love. So in no time, he's gone from the most gorgeous model in the world to the most gorgeous actress in North America.
In maybe three or four issues.
I don't think you know what you're talking about.
What did he want you to do?
...What balls on this guy? What're we...  ...going steady? Jesus.
I don't know if I can quit. We're gonna try it together, like, you know, AA or something. And I made him give up his .22. No more sneaking around the hills with his fucking nut gun like some loony tune.
Would you like another beer?
Skip, you're the head of the whole deal here. Are they busier than you?
So, would you say we're out here... let me think how to put this... Is your problem really that you're... lonely?
She's probably ten years older than you.
Lives downstairs from me. She's got a great dog named for Danny Ainge.
Pretty good, too. Lots of detail. Nothing hard core. Old-fashioned ones, from back when people cared about atmosphere and character.
All right, I'm just gonna tell you, as simple and direct as I can.  And you understand that this is a big secret? Just between us?  Okay. You know I've got this gift for certain kinds of... machines.
Guess.  Go ahead, guess!
I've told you a lot of private stuff.
Somebody's taking a shower down there.
Pretty creepy, huh? Are you totally disgusted?
I'm here for you, Doc.
Yes... your particular approach.
No mortal weapons can kill this creature. He is not of this world.
What then? Robbery? Extortion? Kidnapping!
You never were any good with the ladies, O'Connell.
Ten to one, O'Connell, your odds are no-so-good.
C'mon, friend.
Beni ya little stinkweed, where did you slink off to?
The Prince does not like to be touched by other humans. A Silly eastern superstition, I'm afraid.
The book! The black book they found at Hamunaptra! Imhotep wants it back. Said to me it would be worth it's weight in diamonds.
...and how do you say? Those slimy things, in your stomach?
Miss Carnavon. Gentlemen.
You think it'll send this guy back to hell?
And what is he in prison for?
I will give you one hundred pounds to spare his life.
A bright good morning to all.
You were actually at Hamunaptra?
-- I know what you mean. I was there, alright. Seti's place. The City Of The Dead.
Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?
Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin believe that Hamunaptra is cursed, they call it, "the doorway to hell."
You know your history.
Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks like a sarcophagus.
I'm not?
No... Why?... Should I?
Yes, they never used it because they feared it so. It's written, that if a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever arise, he would bring with him the ten plagues of Egypt.
Then we'll have to find some immortal ones.
He's here! I saw him! That thing is here!
You called me your girl?
I think you were jealous
You stole it from a drunk at the local Casbah?!
Do you really think he'll show up?
Do something, Jonathan! Kill it!
But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know?
And I know the terrible revenge that you plan to inflict on this city.
Um-hmm.
And what's that?
How about... the Savage Six?
It's late. I'm headin' home.
No one will believe us.
Hey... you okay?
Eat your mustard.
How's your dad?
Snap out of it!
What did you do with Captain Amazing?
How 'bout giving me "the tour"?
Who's the artist?
What?
Monica... I was wondering if -- uh -- maybe we -- I mean you and I -- could -- uh -- you know -- get a -- I mean have a...
I admire you.
Being a superhero, wanting to save the world. It's so... unselfish.
Most people just want to make money or be famous or something. But you risk everything, just to help people.
At the Frankenstein Center.
I'm going inside.
Come on, guys -- we're fighting against evil.
But now Casanova's back! And we're gonna sit around here all night eating pizza and telling stories! Hey, lets toast some marshmellows!
You drink too much.
Leave him alone. She's his mother, not yours.
Have you ever seen him?
So what else has Superman got?
GET MAD!
Your Spiderman Pez dispenser! 
He doesn't miss a trick, does he?
He's Lance Hunt! Just take off the glasses -- and it's him!
We need a break, that's all! Nobody'd ever heard of him until he busted Casanova Frankenstein!
What's that?
But... only when no one is looking.
So you're only invisible... to yourself?
Are you famous?
Wow.
Here you go. 
It's on the television.
Jeffrey, YOU THIEF!
I use it... to fight evil.
We may be getting in over our heads here.
Or Batman --
He busted Casanova and sent the crooks packing.
It is a thing entirely unknown in diplomacy, that one government should assume a right to dictate to another, who is upon terms of equality, the conditions on which she should conduct her commerce; and, assuming such a right, second it by threatening language, in case of non-compliance.
It's a fine thing to establish policies but, when they don't work, they must be reconsidered.  Granted that you have hurt England, but she is still on her feet.  And to seal off her trade with Europe, what has it cost you?  You have had to rule with an iron hand.  You have turned friends into enemies.  And even at that, the result has only been partly effective.  You have never been able to stop the extensive cheating, smuggling and corruption -- even of your own officials.  But I should think the situation in Spain, alone, would give your policy a minus balance.  You have had to commit a quarter of a million of your best troops against the guerrillas, with no victory in sight. And you have given England a dangerous foothold on the Continent, for her armies.
Well, that is a very interesting idea, General Kutusov, but I can assure you that Napoleon is no beginner at this.  Whatever analysis you have done on this situation, I am sure that he has gone over the same ground.
If he withdraws his army in good order, it will be a serious political defeat.  But, if he should be caught on the move, with his army, in the full grip of winter, then it will be a catastrophe.  If Your Majesty can prolong his hopes for a treaty by silence, be deceit, by any means, for another month, thus postponing his departure, then the graves of his army are already dug in the soil of Russia.
And, what a great pleasure it is, indeed, to meet you, Alexander.
Ah -- you approve?
Without a doubt, to estimate the enemy's strength on the battlefield. This is something that is only acquired by experience and instinct. At Jena, there were as many opinions about strength of the enemy as there were generals present.  Murat said there were 50,000, preparing to attack.  Berthier said there were no more than 25,000, about to withdraw. "Berthier sees only what is in the open," Murat said.  "But don't forget there is a second force hidden in the forest."  And so it would always go, each of them would judge things according to his own ability, character and state of mind, at the moment.
Yes -- who spoke up?
The 21st Dragoons, about two or three-hundred troopers.
Well, I believe there are at least 30 guns at Sablons.
I must be honest with you.  I first approached three generals more senior than yourself, and they all very prudently sent excuses.
Well, Belliard, what's this?  What are you doing here?  Where is the enemy?
I don't know the details of the treaty, sire, Marshal Mortier sent me word of its having been agreed to, and he said that I was to take the army and make for Fontainebleau.
I don't know what has happened to Prince Joseph.
She should have had Larrey or Corvisart.  They might have saved her... But why didn't anyone even write to me?  Can you believe that no one even bothered to write to me? Would you have believed that I should read such news in a newspaper?  How incredible!
I have just had the most vivid... dream... about Josephine.
Was it he who assigned you to command the escort which accompanied Madame Bonaparte's coach?
Did any difficulties of any kind arise during the trip?
No, they're living in Nice now.
My God...!  What time is it?
Why didn't you wake me then?
I told Mortier that he would answer with his life for any looting.
Impossible, I don't believe it.
No one can say how the Emperor's thoughts work, Ambassador, and unless we move quickly, he might change his mind again.
I have met her.  What is your business with me?
That is correct.
Shall we move closer to the fire?
Will Alexander be joining us soon?
Br-rrr, these sheets are like ice.
What's your name?
Only Lisette?
That's a very nice name.  Where are you from?
I would like both of you to read this.  Please read it aloud.
Naturally, one does not take much stock in such a piece of filth but, on the other hand, it is not the sort of thing one can simply ignore. What do you think, Joseph?
Yes, of course, I would.  You know I am not one of your wife's greatest admirers, but I certainly know nothing about this.
When is she supposed to return?
And you, are you in love with any one else?
Yes -- what is it?
I believe you sent for me.
Well, anyway, sorry to call you away from the festivities, but where is the breakdown on serviceable vehicles?  I asked for it yesterday.
That's all I can say.
Well, whatever the hell you wanted to do, you are going to tell me everything right now.  Do you understand?!
What?
You couldn't face telling me what?
I was in her maid's room at an inn we stopped at for the night, outside of Dijon.  It was an adjoining room to Madame Bonaparte's.
You could hear them?
Do you know the joke about the two Swiss boys who go to a bordello for the first time?
Article 46, calls for the virtual dismemberment of Prussia, reducing her population by half and her army to a token force.
Has Alexander agreed to this?
And where do you place Alexander?
A revolution is not a polite discussion in a parlor, Citizen Lieutenant.  One does not call it murder to kill such vermin.
Come in.
He made friends with a family called Columbier, and would later write of his first flirtation with their daughter, Caroline.
On December 2, 1804, Napoleon was made Emperor of France.  He would later say:  "I found the crown lying in the gutter and I picked it up."
Led by the warlike Queen Louisa, and her fashion-minded husband, King Frederich Wilhelm, the Prussians still believed themselves cast in the mold of Frederick the Great, and more than a match for Napoleon.  The King had a special collection of 60 splendid uniforms, and was personally involved in the design of all the Prussian army uniforms.
Yo' cousin, Craig.  Hook us up.
Hey, Debo, heard you running from a ass- whippin'?
Well, let me in.
Great moves, Day-Day.
What's crackin'?
You know it's been over a year since we kicked it last?  Up at the family reunion.
Who is that?
This you?
What's the matter?
This vacuum don't work.  Where's the restroom?
Craig, what the hell are you doing?
I hope to God that dog is happy.
Wait.
I will.  When can I come visit?
Karla.
Most definitely.
Huh?
Thanks for noticing.  It used ta be peaceful before they got out.  Took over the house and caused my mother's nervous breakdown.
You alright?
Can I help you?
What's the matter?
That nigga worst than them damn pit bulldogs or something!  That's why moving wit'cha Uncle Elroy and Cousin Day-Day is the best thing for you right now.
Nigga, you got knock the fuck out.
See you later, Day-Day.  Come by after work, I got the John Blaze shit for you.
No, give me my damn money back.  Right now, and I don't have no damn receipt neither.
I can't give you your damn money back on this.
What is it?
What was that?
I do.
'Scuse me, partner, but that's a ghetto knock.
Where's Craig?
Shut up!  Both of you right now!
What you say?
Get on.
Just do it.
You too big.
I can't feel my legs no more.
We must be here 'cause we stopped.
Hey, what's going on?
Somebody left me a message.  Well where's Craig and Day-Day?
Huh?
Aw, no lovin' tonight?
All right, I'll do it.
You were saying?  Your daughter....?
I appreciate that.
I have a problem.
You were very nervous.
It's the last chance they have for me to kill you. Try to get out of it. They won't let you. They can't. Try to change the schedule and you'll know I'm right. What have you got to lose? It comes down to who you trust, them or me? Test them.
Hey! I'll take the girl. I'll take the girl!
I will do no such thing.
Look at your watch. Look at it! At one-thirty your little girl is dead. Say it with me. At one-thirty my little girl is dead. Say it. Say it!
This says "invitation only".
I'm not stupid.. I know how this is supposed, to work.
My wife always said I had a problem trusting people.
I don't know.
Ready?
Yes, sweetie, it's me.
I have to do something.
Then why'd you drag me into it?
It's about time I did. I was one of those guys, workaholics. I worked my ass off for them - my wife, my daughter.  That's just what I thought I was supposed to do.
Why don't you tell me about the early years some other time?
Well, is it real? Do we know anything about it?
He's going to help the police. Your daddy is going to be a hero.
I'm not a baby.
Get moving.
I'm looking for them.
And what happens if I don't call you?
God can't help her, Mr. Watson. Only you can help her.
Put her on.
He never told about the money.
No, Ben.
You was quotin' Scripture. You said -- you said, "And a little child shall lead them."
The religion the Almighty and me worked out betwixt us.
Can't hear ye, boy.  ...So the big boats heave a sigh, They blow for Uncle Birdie...
And the Lord told that man --
See ye got two more peeps to your brood.
I'm figurin' how I can say it so's you won't get mad.
What's wrong, Mother?
Is he hit pretty bad?
Sure, but you was worried too, Mother; takin' off with never a word of goodbye. I even got to figurin' them gypsies busted in and done off with all three of 'em.
Twenty-five wives!
Willa Harper there is certain plain facts of life that adds up just like two plus two makes four and one of them is this: No woman is good enough to raise growin' youngsters alone! The Lord meant that job for two!
What he needs is a dose o' salts!
You go set down by the River.
That boy's as stubborn and mulish as a sheep!
I must wend my way down River on the Lord's work.
My, that fudge smells yummy!
Why?
Tell me a story, John.
Pearl! You ain't --
Where are we goin', John?
I'm hungry, John.
Are we goin' home, John?
Where ye from?
John, when your Dad says 'come', you should mind him.
Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --
Are we keeping secrets from each other, little lad?
Pearl, shut up! Pearl, you swore!
Yes; John's bad.
O no! Your turn!
Just tell me now; where's the money hid?
Is there anythin' -- anythin'...?
You thought, Willa, that the moment you walked in that door I'd start in to pawing you in the abominable way men are supposed to do on their wedding night. Ain't that right, now?
Get up, Willa.
She run off with a drummer one night. Durin' prayer-meetin'.
What do you want?
What are you after them for?
This man down at the Drugstore...
This gentleman warn't like them! He just give me a sody and the book.
What'd you all talk about?
Not to worry. No signs of pathology in Nancy's EEG or pulse rate. I'd guess what we've got is a normal young girl who just happens to have gone through two days of hell.
What the hell's going on!?
You believe in the Boogey Man?
Whenever I get nervous I eat.
You ever read about the Balinese way of dreaming?
Hello?
Rod's not a lunatic.
Decide to take a day off after all?
Only family allowed, Nancy. You know the drill.
He's dangerous.
Then you know more than I do -- I haven't even been upstairs.
What's the Coroner got to say?
Maybe god's punishing us all...
Apparently he was crazy jealous. Nancy said they'd had a fight, Rod and Tina.
Did you sleep?
I must be going nuts...
Go even crazier?
Did you ask Daddy to have the hat examined?
What's with the bars?
Bunch of us parents tracked him down after they let him go. Found him in an old boiler room, just like before. Saw him lying there in that caked red and yellow sweater he always wore, drunk an' asleep with his weird knives by his side...
Feeling better?
What you mean 'all at once'?
From Leon.
An omelet! Aren't you living a little above your ration?
An evening gown.
A dress you wear in the evening.
You want this?
...it may step out of a bazaar... it may wait for you in a corridor... it may hide in the shadow of a minaret....
He's cutting our throat...
We don't like Razinin.
Let's be happy that we're all alive.
What a lovely room you have here.
Is there anything I can do for you, monsieur?
Is there anything I can do, Comrade?
Comrades... I'm out of the omelet.
Not that we are giving in one inch, but tell us... what is in your mind?
Count d'Algout is still asleep.
A blue shirt, perhaps?
Your breakfast, monsieur.
I am, Gaston.
Oh, you're a reactionary! Don't you look forward to the day when you can come in here and stand square on your two feet and say, "Hey, you, d'Algout! from now on it's going to be share and share alike"?
Your Highness...
Good evening, Your Highness.
Is this satisfactory?
We don't blame you, Leon, but when we came from Russia we believed in simplicity...
What's the name of that Commissar on the Board of Trade?
You found your way to us and we weren't easy to reach, were we?
How much does this cost?
Yes, monsieur?
Well, boys, I'd like to help you but what can I do? Yesterday I waited six hours in the lobby!
All right, then make an appointment with her so I can see her!
Yes, there's no doubt of that...  Just look out of the window and there it is.
Give me another double brandy.
Here's my passport.... Please give me a visa. I have to leave for Russia immediately.
That's impossible! Nobody has the right.... You can't do that!... If you don't give me that visa...
I see a house that looks like any other house. What's remarkable about it?
He looks sad. Do you whip him?
That is correct.
I acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all.
You don't have to do a thing. Chemically we are already quite sympathetic.
Do you hear that?
It's midnight. One half of Paris is making love to the other half. Look at the clock. One hand has met the other hand. They kiss. Isn't that wonderful?
I can't possibly think of a better reason.
Glorious, analytical...
I must go.
Must one always be after something?
At anything. At the whole ludicrous spectacle of life. At people being pompous and taking themselves seriously and exaggerating their own importance. If you can't find anything else to laugh at you can laugh at you and me.
Because we are an odd couple.
I'll tell you that joke again. A man comes into a restaurant. Did you get that?
I don't look too foolish?
Well, first I should like to take off my hat and jacket.  Then could we have some music?
How do you do?
Oo! Darling! Something is the matter.
Comrades! Comrades!
But, darling, you can't do that.
Quite right... yes, yes, yes, but first you're going in that door and you're going to take a little spirits of ammonia and lie down.
No speech.
Not white, darling.
Radio! What is radio?
No music.
It wouldn't be fair to the man in the street.  There they are... they are terrible things, those jewels....
...they are the tears of Old Russia... see that stone?
Those newspaper people?
What a gruesome proof of the power of the press!
Was it for this that I refused to endorse Dr. Bertrand's Mouthwash? I could have made a little fortune by saying that the Vincent Vacuum Cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by the Romanoffs... and now you want them to smear my life's secrets over the front page of a tabloid?
First tell me, are you my little Volga boatman?
He's a waiter at the Clarence, poor devil. You know him.
This is the Duchess Swana... I want to speak to Monsieur Cornillon... it's very important... please get him right away... Hello, Monsieur Cornillon? The most incredible thing has happened! My jewels are here in Paris! Three Bolshevik swine are trying to sell them! Yes... yes... we must act immediately!... Call the police... Have them arrested!... Well, then, get an injunction!... But do something, Monsieur Cornillon!  ...But they are my jewels! There must be some way of getting them back!
Leon! What in heaven's name...!
Is anything wrong? Are you ill?
That bad?  Old or young?
Leon, darling, how nice! Have you ordered tea or a cocktail?
All right, I'll listen.
And I thought it was something serious! How could you frighten me so?
She's gone, Leon.
That does it, Swana.  Now you mustn't miss your appointment with your hair-dresser.
Don't worry, you were quite rude enough.  Do you mind if I let in a little fresh air and sunshine? I'm sure it will make you feel better and I want you to be at your very best. In full possession of your faculties, at least.
Not before you agree to use those reservations to Moscow.
I am willing to hand over the jewels and sign the necessary papers if you take that five-forty plane to Moscow.
Here, please...
Well... that's my business, madame.
You mean you have finished the whole investigation?
Well, Comrade, I am afraid you will have to turn over that work to someone else.
The future of the common people.
For Christ's sake, it soils my mother's memory.  Do you think I want the whole goddamn world to see my mother like this?  Raising a dirty mouth!
Well, he certainly isn't acting like it.
We could get that.
I agree it's ridiculous but --
I understand that, sir.
How the hell do you have the temerity to blackmail the President of the United States?
Howard, you'll serve no more than two years, then he'll pardon you.
It's a code or something.
Goddamn! How long have we had this fucking dog?!  Two years, he still doesn't come!  We need a dog that looks happy when the press is around.
I like it.  I like the idea.
And?
It's more than that.  It could be more than that.  I want Hunt paid.
What about England?
... Y'know Al, if Hoover was alive none of this would've happened.  He would've protected the President.
I don't have a pistol.
Exactly!  We've got to take the war to them.  Hit 'em where it hurts -- right in the nuts.  More assassinations, more killings.  Right, Al?
About a dozen.
Your lawyers feel it's the ... "smoking gun."
The army?
But O'Brien doesn't even use that office.  The Democrats've moved to Miami.  There's nothing there!
Their fourth!
Well, you know, sir, he's a nut.  He used to work here with the "Plumbers" and now he's running this Watergate caper.  You remember his plan to firebomb the Brookings using Cubans as firemen?  He wanted to buy a damned fire truck!  Magruder thinks he's just nutty enough to go off the reservation.
Should we talk to Trini about paying these guys?  Or maybe Chotiner?
Bob, did I approve the Ellsberg thing? You know, I'm glad we tape all these conversations because ... I never approved that break-in at Ellsberg's psychiatrist.  Or maybe I approved it after the fact?  Someday we've got to start transcribing the tapes.
Uh, no one, of course, is going to see these tapes, but ...
I suppose you thought the Presidency was above this sort of thing.
I think ... I think ... that's the sort of very dangerous and irresponsible suggestion that ... helping the Cuban exiles who oppose Castro would, uh ... not only be a violation of international law, it would be ...
And not just Hunt.  Frank Sturgis, all those Cubans.  All of them in the Watergate.  They were involved in Track 2 in Cuba.  Hunt reported to my military aide. But I met with him several times as Vice President.  That's what worries the shit out of me.  I don't know how much Hunt knows.  Or the Cubans.
Alright.  But why, if Kennedy is so clean in all this, didn't he cancel Track 2?
If they didn't tell Kennedy about Track 2, how did Hoover find out?
Well, one way or the other, Kent State is not good.  We have to get out in front of this thing.  The PR is going to murder us.
... never complain, never explain, John ...
Get that little fucker!  Great tackle! Reminds me of my days at Whittier. Most of these kids are useless.
Because they're not Americans.
We've got to turn the faucet off on this thing.  It's out of control ...  You might burden just me with this in the future.
Helms wants Iran or there might be problems.  All of his old CIA buddies are over there making a fortune off the Shah.
... There can be no whitewash at the White House ... two wrongs do not make a right.  I love America.  God bless America and God bless each and every one of you.
So am I.  Thy father will have to know of thy lying.
We haven't said grace yet.  Richard.
I'm honored, Dick, that you've come all this way out here to Virginia to visit us at last.
Robert Cushman is a lieutenant general in the Marine Corps, the Deputy Director of the CIA ... and this is what you use him for?
I suppose, "Mister President," you're unhappy that we have not implemented your Domestic Intelligence plan, but ...
Of course we've tried, but so far we've come up with nothing that ...
We have recent intelligence that a Soviet nuclear submarine has docked at Cienfuegos.
Are you tapping Kissinger?
Not if you have spies in the White House, it isn't your job.
Mr. Helms, we've lived with Communism in Cuba for ten years ...
CIA policy?  The CIA has no policy, Mr. Helms.  Except what I dictate to you ...  I try to adjust to the world as it is today, not as you or I wanted it to be ten years ago.
By offering Cuba to the Russians as a consolation prize?
Yeah, well, as I said, Edgar ...
Kissinger?
Yeah, you do.  I'd be bugging myself, Edgar ... Who'd get the tapes?
You're fucking me.
Gentlemen, I tried.  I told Kennedy to go into Cuba.  He heard me and he made his decision.  I appreciate your sentiments.  I've heard them from many fine Cuban patriots, but it's nothing I can do anything about.  Now, it's a long drive back to Dallas tonight, and Trini and I have got an early flight tomorrow to New York ...
Only if Kennedy dumps Johnson.
So, what's this about, Dick?
Alright, Henry -- we're gonna go your way.  Crush this Ellsberg character the same way we did Hiss!
You'll pick up the middle on this one - the Jews and Negros.
Housecleaning?  It would be ugly, Henry, really ugly ...
But your writings have changed the world, Mr. Chairman.
Do you miss Cuba, Manolo?
I don't know.  He made me see the stars ...
You're too modest, Nixon.  You're as evil as I am.  We're both from poor families.  But others pay to feed the hunger in us.  In my case, millions of reactionaries.  In your case, millions of Vietnamese.
Rocky's full of shit!  No way he's going to get nominated west of the Hudson with a new wife.  He's gonna be drinking Scotches in retirement at some goddamn country club with the rest of the Republicans.
Let's get out of here; it's too painful.  I hate it.  We went bowling last weekend.  Next weekend we're going to the zoo. Whoever said there was life after politics was full of shit.
This isn't '48, Dick.  They'll never buy it.
But it was all we had.
... Use his women.
The Orangemen!  Now there's a football program.  Jim Brown.  And that other tailback ... The one with the blood disease ...
... I don't really know you yet, Sandy ... What do you like?  I mean, what kind of clothes do you like?  Do you like blue ... red?
What kind of, uh ... music do you like?
Yeah, she lives in Dallas ...
We didn't come here to talk about football.  We came here to end the war.
Someone wants it ...  You can't stop it, can you?  Even if you wanted to.  Because it's not you. It's the system.  And the system won't let you stop it ...
We got the press this time!
There's more ... there's more than just me.  You can't break, my boy, even when there's nothing left.  You can't admit, even to yourself, that it's gone, Al.  Do you think those POWs in there did?
I sure am.  The goddamned missile crisis united the whole country behind Kennedy.  And he was supporting Brown. People were scared, that's why.
It would ruin us, Buddy, our family.
Everything's political, for Christ's sake!  I'm political.  And you're political, too!
Dick, don't...
Yeah ... I'm out.
They love you, Buddy.  They need you, too.
Yes ... you know it!  Yes ... I will. Yeah!
No, I don't.  I'm not Jack ...
Penny for your thoughts.
Not for the Pentagon it isn't.  I'm kissing Mao's ass.  And the press is gonna find some way to shaft Nixon on this one.
And what am I doing?
You don't expect me to believe that for one minute, do you?  Does it matter what's on them? Really? ... Murder, Dick?  Sex?  Your secrets, your fantasies?  Or just me and you and ...
It'll be over soon.
Won or lost?
But being out of the game gives me time to write.
Write.  You know, a book.  I'm calling it "Six Crises."  It's a good thing, Rocky -- take some time off to write.
How you been, Ellis?
Want a cup?
...What you got ain't nothin' new. This country is hard on people. Hard and crazy. Got the devil in it yet folks never seem to hold it to account.
You're discouraged.
No money in his room there?
He is just a goddamn homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom.
All that at the Eagle Hotel. It's beyond everything.
Hard to believe.
Not word one.
Llewelyn can take care of hisself.
Who's Charlie Walser. Oh! Well, I, uh... True story? I couldn't swear to ever detail but... it's certainly true that it is a story.
You wouldn't think a car would burn like that.
Does that look to you like about a '77 Ford, Wendell?
Well. Old age flattens a man.
...Somebody unloaded on this thing with a shotgun.
What about yours?
Sheriff, that's aggravating.
What was the bullet?
Wasn't no bullet?
Are you telling me he shot this boy in the head and then went fishin' around in there with a pocket knife?
You gonna drive out there?
How's that, Sheriff?
...Could I get you to call Loretta and tell her I've gone to Odessa? goin' to visit with Carla Jean Moss.
What do you think.
I wouldn't worry about it.
...Where'd you get the pistol?
I got a bad feelin', Llewelyn.
Mama's gonna raise hell.
We don't have to do this. I'm a daytrader. I could just go home.
You don't know to a certainty. Twenty minutes it could be here.
Huh? What is...
...You getting anything on this?
How'd you find it?
I don't know.
...You need to talk to me.
How much?
This. And the gas.
Didn't mean nothin'.
You're a bit deaf, aren't you? I said what time do you go to bed.
Why would you be comin' back? We'll be closed.
Well... I need to close now --
Look... I got to know what I stand to win.
Tent poles.
What kind of tent?
...You pick the option with the applicable rate.
What about one forty-two.
That's me.
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh. You know how he found you?
Not that way.
Took me about three hours.
Pot metal?
...I'm across the river. At the Hotel Eagle. Carson Wells.  Call me when you've had enough. I can even let you keep a little of the money.
I ask questions. If I get sensible answers then they get to go to America. If I don't get sensible answers they don't. Is there anything about that that you don't understand?
Are you jackin' with me?
Sorry you had to see that. You were saying?
No... Friends from the diner maybe?
Yeah, it was great. Really put the whole idea of "church bake sales" in perspective...
Good God... they're meat eaters, Roy, just drop the shit in there!
Jesus...
So, you think you're gonna find his scalp hanging in some tepee?
Yeah? Well, she called Sue Ann yesterday from Arizona.
Any idea where it is?
We need ammo... Go check his jacket, I'll cover you.
Do you know why I'm here?
Wait. Let me get this out.  I like the symphony, walks in the rain, sunsets, animals and children. I read passionately, and I like to discuss things. I'm basically conservative, but flexible. I've been involved in the death of thirty- two people, but I can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty- two pieces of shit, excuse my language.
Well, thirty-three, but I'm not counting Del, on account of you... so, what do you think?  You probably feel I'm flattering myself to see us together.
No... what about your sister?
It's all right.
Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday...
I gotta go.
Oh, you mean Fred.
Honey, I didn't want to tell you at the time, but Del and I go way back. We went to school together. In fact, he saved my life. Two more minutes in that icy water and I would have drowned. But Del jumped in and grabbed me. We fell out of touch eventually, but I still owe him one.
I just want everything to be perfect between us.
Why are you doing this to me?
So, call me when you --
What was that?
I took the blue Corsica, Del. Relax.
And I don't need Sue Ann's fat ass around to fuck it up...
Hi, Betty. You're looking good...
Have you checked the trunk of that car you're driving, Betty? I think there might be...
Where you headed, Betty?
Let me tell you something. I got groped by these Tunisian guys who thought I was a slut for wearing shorts, it was hotter than stink the whole time, and I got some kind of weird gum disease from the water. Plus, it ended my marriage --
Dr. David Ravell.
You're hurting him!!
You don't sound like you're from here.
So why'd you come to L.A.?
It's something I had to do. For David.
No... I don't really know where he is yet. I'm at a hotel around the corner.
Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men...
Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?
You know, the more I think about it, this really isn't David's kind of place.
Had. She died in a car accident last year. She was decapitated.
Guess who I saw today.
I spent my weekend looking for someone who does -- not -- exist. I should have been here at the hospital with my brother, but I was with you.
Don't worry, I'm looking... just taking a tiny break.
What are those for?
This isn't fair, you know. Do you always get what you want?
What? No, I'm not gonna let you just run out of here... You need to talk about what's going on...
What?! That you had something to do with it?
Yeah, but your running away isn't going to help you with all this...
These guys are here to help you, Betty.
I'm not some snot-nosed resident fresh out of medical school, Blake.
Here's Ghengis Kunt and The Demilitarized Zone. Get it?  They're Korean, so they're pretty hot.
...you can have the best damn running backs in the world, somebody's still gotta block for 'em.
If you ate at the Tip Top you did.
I'm asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.
I didn't think so. So, give me an example of a stupid person doing a stupid thing. Not being stupid, you're equipped to recognize it.
Like what?
Well, my idea of stupid is very different from yours.  So here's how this is gonna work. Would you take your socks off, please?
Hey... you got a fine one right here!
Relax, we brought the cash.
No, that's ignorant. They just don't know any better.
That's right.
You know, a hundred and fifty years ago you'd have been scalped for that remark about Native Americans. Right here where your house is -- you'd have been scalped.
I didn't. You gave me a look!
He's telling the truth. He doesn't know.
What?
You don't look comfortable here. That's 'cause you don't like being the center of attention, do you? Nah. You're like me.
What? What does she represent?! What could some cornbread white bitch from Kansas who's dragging our sorry asses up and down the Louisiana Purchase possibly mean to you?!! I'd just love to know...
How'd they describe her?
We should go.
...crazy! No shit, Shaft!! And you ain't far behind...
No... if we don't finish this job, how are we gonna look at ourselves in the mirror? This is it for me, Wesley, she's the last one. My instinct says I gotta see this through with her, and if there's one thing I've tried to teach you here --
If anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed, it would have been me.
Really?
Alright, I admit it, you had me there. You're better than most of them, anyway... do you have a headshot?
I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do you say?
Fine, but promise me one thing. If we use her, I want to direct those episodes. She's my discovery.
Because it ain't natural, young man.
Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again?
God, that sounds so familiar. Ravell, Ravell... where's he out of?
Hey... Is Betty still trying to find that soap opera guy?
Thankee boys for throwin' in that fricasee. I'm a man a large appetite and even with lunch under my belt I was feeling a mite peckish.
You can't do this -
'N I'm Delmar O'Donnell.
Visit those foreclosin' sonofaguns down at the Indianola Savings and Loan and slap that cash down on the barrelhead and buy back the family farm. Hell, you ain't no kind of man if you ain't got land.
Huh?!
What do we do now, Everett?
...but try getting a decent hair jelly.
Preacher said my sins are warshed away, including that Piggly Wiggly I knocked over in Yazoo!
Well that's right! If then! Believe me, Delmar, Woman is the most fiendish instrument of torture ever devised to bedevil the days a man!
It's Tommy! They got Tommy!
We'll go fetch it with ya, Everett.
Gonna paddle ah little bee-hind.
Well, that's how I characterize it.
Helluva idea.
Have him join us, run our campaign 'stead a that pencil-neck's.
Vernon Waldrip.
...Time for this old boy to enjoy some repose.
That's one of Aunt Hurlene's.
Well, I'm sorry honey -
A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey.
The hell it ain't square one! Ain't no one gonna pick up three filthy unshaved hitchhikers, and one of 'em a know-it-all that can't keep his trap shut!
...Nah, that ain't right... I'm thinkin' of...
It was a moment a weakness!
Fact of the matter - there never was!
This is crazy. No one's ever gonna believe we're a real band.
Well sir, my name is Jordan Rivers and these here are the Soggy Bottom Boys outta Cottonelia Mississippi- Songs of Salvation to Salve the Soul. We hear you pay good money to sing into a can.
Sir, we are Negroes. All except our a-cump- uh, company-accompluh- uh, the fella that plays the gui-tar.
Soggy Bottom Boys - I don't precisely recollect, uh -
Holy-moly. These boys're a hit!
Mama said you was hit by a train!
You, Zack?
This is it. This is where I live. I suppose you could bunk over there and you could go to school at the base.
Hey, honey, look at this! My son! Isn't he beautiful?  You should've called!
Ay, palequero. Never hochi in the P.I.
Why?
Hey, what did you want? A lot of fatherly bullshit? A big pat on the back?
Better watch out for that kind, Zackie. You know what they call 'em, don't ya?
She said you told her in every letter how much you loved her, how you wanted to marry her, have children with her...
You're pretty funny, Mayo.
Hey, baby, you could get sent to war, get your ass shot down.
Hey, did you hear? Sands and Kantrowitz DORed last night.  Survival of the fittest.
Joe!
When did this happen?
Are you laughing at me, dick-brain?
Mayo, the rest of your class knows about candidate Worley, and we're all sorry.
What're you waiting for, Mayo? Get your scuzzy ass up here.
Daddy, I don't want to get into anything with you tonight. I'm tired and I...
Don't you dare ask me that question. I'm an adult and you got no right to push your nose into my affairs like that!
Yes I do!
Exactly how late are you, Lynette?
Sid, there's no baby.
I'm not pregnant. I got my period this morning. There's no baby, Sid.
See you in a month when you get liberty!
Well, it you're not gonna ask, then I will. How was it?
How did it go with you guys?
You serious about having him over?
What did you tell him about the baby?
And you turned him down??
Hey, what kind of name is Pokrifki?
Italian. My mom was Irish. I got her ears. But the rest is all wop.
You got a girl?
I hear most of the girls who come to these things are looking for a husband.
Yeah? Why're you here?
Think you'll make it all the way to getting your wings?
Just think 'I'm gonna do it!' Program yourself. See yourself making it. It'll happen. I know 'cause I just read this article in Cosmo, and it was about that very thing.
There's always a choice.
Zack, I dare you not to fall in love with me. I ain't gonna get serious with you, no way. But how can you resist me? I'm like candy.
Want me to get a towel?
Call me during the week if you get the chance.
Paula, he DORed and nobody's seen him.
I'll never get it polished in time. Give me a buckle, Zack.
You'd make it. He's just getting to the girls. Come on, Zack. I gotta see my family, man. I couldn't take it if he keeps me here over the weekend.
I see you didn't DOR, Mayo.
Hey, you gonna tell anybody about this?
My girl back home. We're supposed to get married after I get my wings. She was Tommy's girl. They were engaged to be married before he died.  I should've told you about her. I don't know why I didn't, except I didn't want you to think I was a shit for making it with Lynette.
Calm down, Sweet Pea. She seen a doctor?
It's a big religious thing with her and she won't even discuss it.
Not if she won't even talk about an abortion.
Please, Zack -- go back to the barracks!
You're fuckin' A we can do this.
So what the fuck are we supposed to do?!
You should see the look on your face.
Stop it!  Stop it!
What?  What do you want me to do?
Are you okay?
The hell does she want?
That's your problem.
-- posed to mean?
Bullshit.
They're not supposed to be here!
They're not supposed to be here!
Forty-five minutes.  That's all you said you need.  That's like nothing.
They won't get hurt.
Asshole.
Where did you get this clown?
When you said you'd let 'em go I thought she'd come running right out for sure.
I'm afraid to let you think, Junior. Things get worse when you think.  Oh, that's gonna help.
She said she did.
Cell phone.
Yeah?
'Bout four o'clock.
What do you want?
Can we come in?
I don't have to tell you there is an acute shortage of living space in Manhattan right now and this is a highly unique property.
I hardly see how family gossip is germane to showing the property.
Hey, this is perfect for you...  Absolutely!  You're a woman, you're living alone now.  Your alarm goes off, or you head glass break, or for whatever reason you think someone's broken into your home in the middle of the night.  What are you going to do?  Call the police and wait until they get here on Tuesday?  Traipse downstairs in your sexy little underthings and check it out?  I think not!
Cut it back a little bit.
No cars.  Feet are faster.
Makes me nervous.
Ever read any Poe?
The phone works.  Hey, I hooked up the phone.
478...
Are you freaking out?
Why did the chicken cross the road?
Morse code?
Where'd you learn S.O.S.?
Got him!
Call Dad!
He'll do something.
What?
I'm sorry, Mom.
Those ain't cops.
Okay now, er, Huey, so what's your telephone number?
Well if anyone's gonna protect Malcolm's legacy it better be us.
What the fuck?
Sit down, This concerns you too.  I don't need to say that your department's handling of the Black Panthers -- particularly Inspector Brimmer's "undercover operation" has been a complete travesty.
You're Judge right? We need to talk.
Why didn't you tell us about the party you boys were planning at the capitol?
Get out of the car.
Judge, hold on, is your phone safe?
Go! Run! Go on! Get the fuck out of here!!
Yeah... I'm fucked up. You're fucked up. Government's fucked up. Whole country's fucked up. You got no idea what's going on here. This is bigger than you and me. We're just little tiny soldiers getting moved around on some big asshole's desk. The Panthers... fuck you're history... they killed you and you don't even know it.
Drugs Judge, they're gonna flood West Oakland with dope. Jack you up and string you out like a two dollar whore. And while the community's shuffling for a fix, they're gonna snuff every Panther they can find.
Sabu... High white dude's the only thing you could hustle.
I ain't gonna tell you no more. No pushing in the neighborhood, especially not on my fucking street. You're killing your own people asshole.
Motherfucker... you stay away...
C'mon Judge we got to start somewhere.
Hey, it's the invisible man. Brother where you been?
Don't I know it. Come on in Agent Rodgers. Sit down. Always a... pleasure to see you. How can I be of help?
I want it duly noted, that this operation was entirely under the auspices of the Oakland Police Department. The FBI doesn't have a monopoly on agents infiltrating enemy organizations, my friend. As I've said before, Agent Rodgers, we have things under control in our city...
Rodgers... this is no good...
To be quite honest it turns my stomach.
But lots of our people don't read, man. They need strong imagery to help them out.
Yes sir, I did.
You're a little old to be a school boy aren't you brother.  Cool it! You're probably not the only one they've gone after. Stall a little so they believe you're for real. Make them trust you.  Hey Tyrone, you figure feeding our children is gonna make The Man jumpy?
That's right. We'd be proud to provide as escort for Malcolm's widow. How many men you got?
You were. infantry right?
Yeah... You were a lot of help with those guns. Your soldier shit is bad- ass.
I saw... but...
You're a smart brother... you should dig what Huey and Bobby got to say...
What? You don't like to see a traitor get hurt? I wonder why that is?
Sorry man...
You better just kill me Tyrone. And when Huey gets out, when Oakland's just wall to wall junkies, you tell him you blew away the only chance we all got. I'm sure he'll be real happy about that.
We'll all get out of here together.
Rose, what the hell you doing here?
God damn it's him. I gotta go.
Yeah.
I hear them boys, those Black Panthers, they're communists. They don't even believe in God.
Congratulations.
I say we drink the wine, shoot the dogs, and use the papers for musket wadding.
Cheerful news to greet the morn.
You look well, Charlotte.
Of course, I do.
Shall we proceed?
Certainly you must know that in civilized warfare, officers in the field must not be accorded inappropriate levels of hostile attention.
Colonel, imagine the utter chaos that would result from un-led armies having at each other.  There must be gentlemen in command to lead and, when appropriate, restrain their men.
It seems our Swamp Fox wants to have a formal parley.
Father, a post rider came from Charleston.  You have a letter inside.
Is that why the Assembly was convened?
Father, I've lost respect for you. I thought you were a man of principle.
Is it?
Less than a mile.  Forty-one wagons, a company of Redcoat infantry, horses at the rear.
Lord Cornwallis is brilliant.  His weakness is that he knows it.
Gabriel?  Are you asleep?
Stay the course... your mother used to say that to me when I'd get drunk or lose my temper.
Tarleton has a list of our men, most are on it.  A regiment of dragoons is going to the homes on the list, burning them, killing whomever resists, women and children, as well.
Mister Robinson, I fought with Captain Marion in the French and Indian War, including the Wilderness Campaign.  We served as scouts under Washington and I have no doubts about Captain Marion's courage or competence on a battlefield. There's not a man in this room, or anywhere, for that matter, to whom I would more willingly trust my life.
A long time ago...
I recognize him now.  Is he as imprudent as his father was at his age?
We saw.
We're a breath away from losing this war.  In the North, Washington is reeling from Valley Forge, running and hiding from Clinton and twelve thousand Redcoats.  Here in the South, Cornwallis has broken our back.  He captured over five thousand of our troops when he took Charleston and today he destroyed the only army that stood between him and New York.
Fall, six months at the earliest.
Not held, just slowed down.
His wife was killed yesterday.  She was with child.
Goodbye, Francis.
Reverend.
Father, I saw a post rider at the house.
Father, you can't let them take him...
Who might you be, little Miss?
It's gorgeous!
Yes, but the rope might be--
Please hurry.
Have you got a death-wish, Ellen?
Yeah, I know...how are things out there in Chicagoland?
Because you promised.
I don't know, honey. Different people believe all sorts of different things happen to us when we die. Some believe in heaven or hell. Some think we're born again as little children--
I don't get it.
I'm not tired!
Ellie--
No--but if he drops by, I'll tell him to call you.
What?
Who owns the woods up ahead? Paper companies?
Not yet...how much further is it?
Loved that cat pretty well, didn't she?
Micmacs used to call it Little God Swamp.
The Micmac Indians. I brought you here to bury Ellen's cat.
What are those for?
Doesn't look like they last long.
I most generally don't start before noon, but this looks like an exception.
I tried to tell myself I buried him alive. You know--Edgar Allan Poe meets Felix the Cat. But...
They buried their dead and for a long time their dead stayed buried. Then something happened. Half the tribe died in a season. The rest moved on. They said a Wendigo had soured the ground.
Rachel not feeling well?
Leave me alone!
---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and---
It was that place. That creepy cemetery up in the woods. Whatever disease the kids in this town have got, I don't want Ellie to catch it.
You'll be fine, Ellie. Now you can be excused. Go and wash your face.
My dory.  The Jolly Mon.  Where is it?
AnaMaria, trim the mainsail!
We got that part.  Anything else?
Hah.  Ten years you carried that pistol, and you end up wasting your shot.
I know whose blood you need, to end the curse.
What -- you don't have the medallion?
Like after you've killed ... Every ... Last ... One ... of Norrington's men.
There's ... another exit?
That's proper, sir, according to the code.
Do you believe him?
My apologies, miss.  As you were saying, before you were so rudely interrupted?
There was a lot of long words in there, miss, and we're not but humble pirates.  What is it you want?
You have a name, missy?
Elizabeth, I'm relieved you're safe.  Clap him in irons.  And behind his back this time.
Actually, I find it all fascinating.
Difficult ... to say.
Why would my father send this to me?
There.  And don't you dare tell me that wasn't a proper kiss!
You?!
Has it changed since the last time you were here?
Don't be thinking I'm happy about this, Elizabeth.  But I see no use in wailing and gnashing my teeth over that which I can do nothing about.
Nothing ... it's nothing.  Just ... I'm reminded of a song I learned as a child.  A song about pirates.
To freedom.
These men will be facing an enemy that seemingly cannot be killed.
Oh, there's a hard tale, Jack. Most of the decent pirates in town won't sail with you -- seem to think you're a jinx.
Jack gave hisself up for the sake of his loyal crew.  He was marooned on an island, left there to die.
It's a signal.  If we resist, it won't just be death.  There'll be torture as well.
Hands!  Come about!  Jackets off the cannons!  We are to fire on our own ship?
Agreed.  You have the momentary advantage, sir.  But I will see you smile from the yard arm, sir.
Some sort of to-do up at the fort, eh?  You two weren't invited?
Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isn't it?
Norrington, think about it ... the Black Pearl, its captain and crew ... the last pirate threat in the Caribbean.  How can you pass that up?
You would do that?
It's still against the law.
Sure -- because he could always go pirating.
But I survived.  And I still have that single shot.  It's meant for one man.  My mutinous first mate--
On what?
Will -- don't do anything stupid! Don't say anything stupid --
There's no *real* ship as can match the Interceptor.
You've seen it?
He may be.
Wheelchair accessible.
What did you use?
Poison?  I'm surprised at you.  You lack vision, Mr. O'Brien.
Please, O'Brien, don't do this to me!  I'll give you anything you want!
You can't do this!  You owe me, O'Brien.  I made you plastic!  I made you!
Oh no?  Smell this.
Oh no.  No.  We'll get her assistant.  What's-his-name? Nebbishman?
You know how I feel about you.  You know how much I need you.  How much I trust you.  I would do anything for you.
Did you feel that?
Of course you understand, Dr. Argon, that once the nanobot is inside of you, there is no going back --
Yeah, I do!
Yeah.  I knew him when I was still in school.
They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the bonding element.
Well, you got another problem.
You're afraid of him.
You want to tell me what I'm looking for?
He's probably right, sir, the building is probably going to collapse under its own weight.
Somebody has to.
Oh no.  Not by a long shot.  I may look like the old Daniel O'Brien, but on the inside, nothing is the same.
Oh yeah.  See, Susie, a man doesn't do the hard time and just pick up where he left off.  Oh no.  The big house does things to a man.
The big house.
Nothing really worthwhile.
We've had this conversation already, Daniel.
Daniel, give him the Trix.
... just like the mouse.
The nanobot combined your molecules with the plastic molecules in the white assembler fluid, so that on a molecular level you now have more in common with a Good Year tire than a human being.
The replicators start off like assemblers, but the replicators never stabilize.
I think while we're waiting, we had better run some basic diagnostics on you.
What's that supposed to mean?
Victim my ass!  You stole my security key and used it to break into my lab to do who knows what kind of damage!  Maybe this is the end of the story and you finally got what you deserved!
Come on, I don't see you living in a cave!
I'm going to go out for a while.  I want to take the blood samples to a lab that has the equipment I need.
Only this ain't no tranquilizer gun. Now let's go!
All the different ways that I could kill you.
Vermin...
In fact, would it be safe to say, based on your general knowledge of this character, that he is already in the building?
You know something, lady, if you sold life insurance, I'd go for a policy in sixty seconds.
What do you want?
You're a peculiar person. Why the other day I pleaded with you not to send in that story and — 
Really?
Oh, Mother!
Your place?
Oh, Mother will give us the blue room. You haven't a red room, have you?  Well, bless her heart. Wouldn't that be nice! My, oh my - six rooms and two baths and a blue room. I guess she would let us have the right wing if we needed it, wouldn't she?
Look Anne, you're not serious about this, are you?
Listen Stew baby, let's not talk about things like that now—
Darling, I don't care whether you can look Gallagher in the face or not, but you're gonna be a good boy and wear garters.
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll wear garters and you'll like it too!
Yes. As a matter of fact, you failed to mention that Gallagher was a girl.
No? What do you look upon her as?
Stewart! We're all waiting for you. Where's your valet?
I'm talking about - I'm not going out.
Go downstairs, and tell them - anything. Tell them I'm not going. Tell them I'm not home.
I'll tell you what. Let's you and me sneak out all by ourselves—
I'll tell you what let's do - I'll take you and introduce you to all my gang. Would you like that?
Oh hello, Anne– He types furiously.
What is this person doing here?
Good morning, Mother. Didn't I tell you that he'd be marvelous. Everybody thought he was so charming last night.
Ah-ah-ah!
Why doesn't Dexter show some decency? And you might show some too, Mother. What do you expect a man to do when he's called such names?  I'm glad you hit that reporter, Stewart. He deserved it.
I want to see Stew Smith. Oh excuse me - I mean Mr. Smith.
I got him his job on the paper. I'm a stock-holder, you know.
Yeah!
Oh, that's all right with me. I won't hold it against you. But you see, I'm here to find out about—
Give my regards to your managing editor.
Say, take it easy! Take it easy! Listen, my boy. No use you hanging around here. Just buy the Tribune tonight and read all about it. You can rewrite it for your last edition.
Big Chief Bingy come to white man's tepee to make friends. Big Chief very sorry. To show how sorry - will bend over and let white man kick Big Chief where sun never shines.
Yeah, little Gloria.
Not on my own beat, no.
Gallagher and myself just came over here to do a little work on a story -
Well, when are you quitting?
What play?
Who are you?
Did you take anything out of those pants?
What are you doing fooling around in here?
Are you trying to tell me that I need someone to help me put on my pants and button them up?
Now I'm sorry. I appreciate your efforts. But I don't need anybody to help me button my pants - I've been buttoning my pants for thirty years all right, and I can button 'em with one hand as a matter of fact.
Yes, sir. Very good, sir.
I was sent from the Post in place of our social editor.
There you go, talking like a woman!
Sure, you ran away. Aren't you going to congratulate a guy?
Do you think your wife would walk up three flights of stairs just to eat out of paper plates?
Well, I'll have to look someplace else.
Gee Gallagher, do you look good! What are you doing to yourself?
Well, Gallagher! Glad to see you.
Then how do you expect to write about it?
What do you know about Conrad?
Then why don't you write about something you know?  Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme.
Oh, sure. She'd make a beautiful heroine...
I wouldn't worry too much about it, Stew. She'll see it your way.
What did he want?
Well, at best you might deny it.
I suppose you know why I came—?
Come in, Joe. It's all right.
I'm sorry nobody could come.
Pardon me, madam. They phoned through from the Mayor's committee to remind you it's past the hour for the reception.
As a matter of fact, I was just trying to decide the color of Anne's eyes. I can't tell whether they're blue, or whether they're violet. What would you say, Mrs. Schuyler?
Indeed? Perhaps he will do me a great favor.
He's a worm - and I'm gonna step on him!
That's the fourteenth crack you've made to me. I'm keeping count. When you get to twenty, I'm gonna sock you right on the nose. As a matter of fact, I ought to sock you right now.
Now, now Jeeves.[5] Was that nice? Was that being a gentleman, Jeeves? Was it, Jeeves? Your name is Jeeves, isn't it?
It's haunted just the same.
Yes sir.
I just love you in that sweater Mary-Sue. It's so flattering.
I put blueberries in them just the way you like.
Yes ...  It's just that ...
Bu-ud ... Mary Sue ... Your breakfast is getting cold.
Why no. She's still on her date with Biff ... is something the matter?
Wait.
Thank you.
Oh, hi ...
I just thought ... It's beautiful.
Isn't it great how she's resting like that?
No she's not.
What is that?
Sounds nice ... Once you get used to it.
I told you where I was.
... And you always seemed so smart and everything. Like that report you did on "Our Town Hall." Gosh. I didn't know what I'd talk to you about.
So I know I haven't been steady with anybody, but I just don't want to rush it. You don't want to make a mistake with something that important.
I mean, there's kids that are even holding hands already but I figure there's plenty of time for that kind of thing later on. Don't you?
... Why?
Mary Sue--C'mon ...
I don't believe it.
You want to ask her out tonight, right? And then you want to give her your school pin ...
I didn't say that. It's just that right now ...
C'mon. Everyone's turning colors. Kids are making out in the street. No one's getting their dinner-- hell, you could have a flood any minute ... Pretty soon you could have the women going off to work while the men stayed home and cooked ...
Oh my gosh. What's he gonna to do?
Why don't you start by saying "yes," and then getting me one of those swell pineapple kabobs.
Are you alright?  What is it?
Did you do this?
BUD--WHY DID YOU DO THIS?
Do you further admit that this was done surreptitiously and under the cover of darkness?
I think I've got something to say.
Dan! Arrest them!
You put handcuffs on them and you take them to the police station.
And where's that?
What's outside of Pleasantville?
Oh God.
Those are my friends.
So what's the point?
What did you do to him?
They're happy like this.
Me too. Sounds swell.
Not directly anyhow ...
Yeah ...
Are you sure?
That was sure swell ...
I baked you my oatmeal cookies.
Hi.
Sure ... Where would we go?
I picked them myself. They grow wild up here.  Mmm. So sweet.
Can I open it?
I like calling you David.
... Her father.
McIntire's.
Oh sure you do ... "McIntire's Department store" ... "Their father dressed as Prince Charming." That was gorgeous Bud.
What?
I'll be honest with you Bud. I'm getting sorta concerned about what I'm seeing in some of these re-runs ...
BUD.
Look ...
OW!
So ... I guess as long as I'm here, all sorts of things could happen to this place. We could have pink lawns and blue trees ...
How long do you think you've been here?
What's wrong?
You know, if this ever happens again, you can make the fries even if I haven't put out the napkins yet.
Look, you can't always like what you do. Sometimes you just do it because it's your job. And even if you don't like it, you just gotta do it anyway.
Wow ... That's pretty good ...
Really?
Oh, hi.
Aren't you a little early?
What's wrong?
Gosh, I loved that show. Watched it for years.
Free?
This is Barry.
Hello, Karen. I'm just working.
Well, I can't talk though --
I'm looking at your advertisement for the airline promotion and giveaway?
It's hard to understand because it says in addition to but I can't exactly understand in addition to what because there's actually nothing to add it too...
So, just to clarify, I'm sorry: Ten purchases of any of your Healthy Choice products equals five hundred miles and then with the coupon the same purchases would value one thousand miles --
It's extension 215 if you want to try me back.
Hey, how are you? BARRY I'm fine, hi, how are you?
Hello.
Yes, indeed, yes I am.
Yeah, but please don't do that.
You don't do anything, why are you being scared?
Did you ask Walter to get you a shrink?  Barry, did you ask Walter to get you a shrink? What's wrong with you? Are you ok?
Yeah I can't.
Goodbye.
What about her? You didn't ask her out, you're such a pussy --
Oh My God, yeah, I know exactly where she is, why?
Tell me why.
Hello, this is Back.
Hi. This is Jack.
...just talking to you....
It doesn't matter.
No.
...yes...
Thank you. What do you do, Barry?
Yeah....do you do well, do you make alotta money?
So.....are you stroking it, yet, honey?
I'm going to work.
Yes.
Should I call back and talk to your girlfriend?
Why did you tell me you did, then?
Come on, I thought we had fun, rich boy --
Ok. Maybe I'll see you later. Thank you for your help.
It must be weird for you to have so many sisters?
What do you do with all this pudding?
Six months, maybe five, five or six months...do you wanna check that?
I was, yeah, I was thinking about going there for business --
-- I'm probably not gonna go though.
This is funny.
Alright?
That's very nice. Thank you. Thank you for saying that.  You're friends with my sister?
How long have you known her?
You like her?
No I didn't say that.
I have a better idea of where we can go.
There's a better place for us to eat.
I don't know.
Really?
Have a good trip.
Hello?
Yeah?
I just wanted to make sure.
Oh my god, you are so adorable. I just....god dammit.
I just...your face is so adorable and your cheek and your skin, I wanna bite it....I wanna bite your cheek and chew on it....god damn cute....fuck....
Yeah.
That's right you travel so much.
I forgot about that.
....I'm not exactly sure what that means...
It's a plastic, yeah.
Ok...because of the time difference if you needed to call me early?
And your billing address and the name as it appears on the card?
And your Social Security number.
You want her to call you Jack?
That's fine. Can I have a telephone number, area code first on where we can call you back?
Now are you threatening me, dick?
You better watch your mouth, cunt, you're gonna get hurt.
What's up?
Yeah.
I don't have anyone to talk to things about and I understand it's confidential with a doctor - I'm embarrassed about that and I don't want my sisters to know?
I had this whole thing in my head, I was gonna be able to get this to you today -- I have to leave today --
Hey, good morning, Barry.
You ok?
What is this?
Good morning, Barry....
It's not a piano. LANCE! LANCE! MAKE SURE THAT YOU CALL THAT GUY IN TOLEDO.
What's up?
Alright: And I have to go and buy some more pudding for this trip to Hawaii and as I just said that out loud I'm realizing it sounds a little strange but it's not. So can you come and help me out?
Hey.
No, no, no, no c'mon man, don't make it a thing --
Yes.
HEY. You made a fucking sex call and now you're gonna pay. It's not a big thing -- just give us some money and then it's over -- we'll just walk down to the ATM and get your money out --
Ok. This is what you get when you're a pervert -- you said you'd help someone out and you didn't so we're just getting some money for her and that's that.
This is Barry.
Hi, Kathleen, I'm just working.
Nothing.
I'm just talking on the phone to you and standing.
I know.
I don't really remember that.
This is this place called Ace Vintage, you gotta find it, I don't know exactly where this is and I don't understand these maps so just go there and check it out. It's a '61 AC Cobra that this old guy says is fine, but I need to figure out why he's only asking 23 for it. So take a look, the whole thing, call me about that, if it seems alright then I'll head down there and check it out.
So they'll go.
Just tell him to call me.
You've been to his quarters, haven't you?
If you're going to slander him, then you don't deserve to hear his stories --
"To seal the wound, he took a poker from the fire --"
Charenton has changed; it's not safe for you here.
I should've told you it was the blood of Christ; you'd believe that, wouldn't you?
Have you truly read the book in question? Or did you run -- straightaway -- to the dog-eared pages?
It's a fiction, not a moral treatise.
You've a touch of the poet, too; perhaps you should take up the quill.
He can't do that to me.
What the devil --
I have a proposition.
You're tense, darling. You could use a long, slow screw.
If it were up to the Doctor, you'd be flayed alive.
What on earth would that require?
It's a potent aphrodisiac, isn't it? Power over another man.
Don't confuse one organ with another --
Abbe de Coulmier!
Indiscretions, Abbe? Please. I've read his case history. At sixteen, he violated a serving girl with a crucifix. After six months in the dungeon at Vincennes, he mutilated a prostitute, cutting her flesh with a razor, then cauterizing the wounds with wax --
He no longer roars or spits. He no longer taunts the guards or molests his fellow wards --
You have to believe me, I had no idea --
Madame Bougival; Mademoiselle Clairwil -- and of course -- the Marquis' wife --
You ought to be ashamed, Abbe. Exploiting those drooling, pathetic cretins for financial gain --
"As he loosened his manhood from beneath his robes, The Bishop muttered a Latin prayer. And then -- with a mighty thrust -- drove it into her very entrails --"
I'll be waiting.
And then -- to prove your truly mine -- I'll plunder you, darling, from behind!
Did I frighten you?
The unhappy tale of a virginal laundry lass, the darling of the lower wards, where they entomb the criminally insane.
What have they done to you now?
Surely you've seen a man naked.
I must say, in your novels you stoke the most unrealistic expectations.
-- whose cell lies next to the linen cabinet! There, armed with a quill of my own, I'll commit it to paper!
A tale more horrible than all the rest combined!
"...your wife."
It is customary to write first, and request an appointment --
But you've a pension, haven't you, from the sale of his books?
Good God, Marquise --
You've no right to assault me in this fashion; I'll call for my footman. I'll have you removed --
Public scorn carries a terrible sting. Trust me. I'm a woman who knows.
Doesn't that please you?
I'd prefer to have our brandy in the salon. There we can sit... side-by- side... before the fire.
Ever met Walter Winchell?
Of being found out. Of not being a genius
And we would hear them scuttling around at night with their little red eyes and little yellow t-t- teeth and I'm just imagining plague lice jumpin' all over the damn place So we set t-t-traps everywhere. And every morning we would find the t-t-traps sprung but no mice!
It's not so bad here. After all, what girl doesn't want to live in a castle?
Sure you can, just--
Who are you, sir?
How does one get 125 million dollars in debt?
Well -- he got us, didn't he? She stands and goes quickly to pour a drink. A forced laugh
You don't have any money left, okay?! That's the truth. I don't wanna say it, nobody else will say it, but it's the truth. You spent it all. You can't buy the Tribune in Chicago -- you can't buy ^ g-g- goddamn thing. Now you better face up to it--
Did you need it? Did you need any of it?
You are repellant when you drink.
Fuck you, Mr. Kane.
He lied to me
Keep filming.
That's right. A symphony of those: vaunted and valued tellers-of-truth. Those heroic minutemen standing sentry on our liberties--
You drink at 10 am, do you?
Hearst?
And Mr. Hearst has authorized me to tell you that you're looking at the most beautiful lawsuit in history if you release this picture. He'll bleed your little studio dry and you can all go on back to New York and do Shakespeare with the Boy Wonder.
But you keep coming up with the same elitist crap - - HEART OF DARKNESS with a million dollar budget?! - - no one wants to see that.
Not for me.
Howard Hughes killed Jean Harlow?
"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a stately pleasure dome decree. . . "How big is it, all told? The estate?
Jesus
Here you are, up with the birds for once, you vampire!
How long have we spent casting our minds about the world when the answer to our prayers was right here under our noses -- every single day in the newspapers and on the radio -- waiting for us in that ridiculous castle! Waiting for--!
The people. When they pay him homage, he adores them. But when they have the ... audacity to question him. To doubt him. To embarrass him. Then he despises them.
The title?
Cain -- like the Bible guy?
I --um-- I don't know if I should. I ain't been drinking since I started on this--
Did I ever tell you about my father?
What have I done?
Monstro! Ran into Walter Winchell outside He wants to play Herod in the picture. Hiya, George.
May I help you?
You talked to New York?
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud."
I know, I know! But what more can you expect of me?! I have pared this story down to the marrow to save money but to cut more would be to--!
Now don't have a fit -- but I want you to think again about doing WAR OF THE WORLDS-
This is an abomination There's no music and--
Well it' s all you've got !
You wanna commit suicide, fine! You got some death- wish, fine! But you will not drag this company down with you!
I told you! Where? Grauman's? El Capitan? Or did Radio City come crawling back?
It's my birthday this week. I'll be 26.
Aside from everything else, your family all right?
What who's been sayin'?
This looks done.
Sure. What is it?
You want me to do what?
What was that for? I know you can take punches. I can hit you from now to doomsday. What the fuck does that prove?
Huh?
I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there. Dressed up and everything.
Hey, watch your mouth. Don't talk like that. She's still my wife.
Well, sometimes you shouldn't listen to me! Now I don't know if I can make it down to 155. I'm having trouble making 160, and without telling me, you sign me for a fight at 155 pounds, and if I don't make 155, I forfeit $15,000! You're supposed to know what you're doin'. You're supposed to be a manager!
Say what you gotta say. Don't be a smart ass.
Nah, she would never...
Maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit her so she can't talk to you the way she wants to.
Sure, I'll keep an eye on her.
What? I just said hello. Since when I can't kiss my sister-in-law?
Well, you're not supposed to kiss your mother on the mouth.
Didn't it have nothin' to do with me?
Some things changed between us. Now, he thinks who the fuck he is. He's been passing certain remarks that I don't like.
You givin' me that look. I gotta accept your word, but if I find out anythin', I'm gonna kill somebody...
It ain't worth it, Jake. Get out.
Just keep your eye on the ball.
Now take the rest off.
Tell me, you think of anybody else when I'm making love to you?
I went out.
I called. You weren't there.
What was it about?
Did you ever go to the Copa when I was away?
Answer me when I talk to you. What happened that night?
You're the fuckin' animal! You ran around with every guy I knew while I was breakin' my ass for you.
Why don't you just call him up?
Aw, c'mon. Don't say that.
Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?
Salvy, would I steer you wrong? Let's say that's the truck; it's full of cigarettes, right? Now, two o'clock this morning we move the truck from here to there,  take the cigarettes out, sell 'em, make some cash.
Hey, leave the kids alone.
Talk some sense into him, will ya? You're still his brother. If he ain't gonna listen to you, he ain't gonna listen to nobody!
I think that's about the time I fell asleep.
Who said they left then?
I hate to remind you -- but this all started because you said she was murdered. Now did anyone, including you, actually see her murdered?
I can't do it even if he's gone.
A detective's nightmare.
Oh -- that phone call!  I gave them your number -- hope you don't mind.
Listen to me! Lisa's been arrested.
Like Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring. If that woman were still alive, she'd be wearing it.
I don't know what pet name Thorwald had for his wife. And that night he went out half a dozen times with the metal suitcase. He wasn't taking his possessions, because they're up in his apartment now!
Just don't dally. Thorwald knows he's being watched. He won't hang around long.
Stop sounding stuffy. I'll take pictures from a jeep. From a water buffalo if necessary.
Read some good books.
It's about time you got married -- before you turn into a lonesome and bitter old man.
Something wrong?
Well -- did you get it, Thorwald?
I can't. The police have it by now.
That's abnormal.
Nonsense. A man is always ready for marriage -- with the right girl. And Lisa Fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain, who can get one eye open.
Her father loading up the shotgun?
You're never going to marry?
Look, Mr. Jefferies. I'm not educated. I'm not even sophisticated. But I can tell you this -- when a man and a woman see each other, and like each other -- they should come together -- wham like two taxies on Broadway. Not sit around studying each other like specimens in at bottle.
People have different emotional levels that --
Isn't there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction?
What about this morning? Any developments?
Huh?
Mrs. Thorwald?
No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible.
You know, Miss Fremont -- he might just have something there.
What about the rest?
Who's Thorwald?
I couldn't think of anything more boring and tiresome than what you've been through. And the last week must be the hardest.
Jeff -- isn't it time you came home? You could pick your assignment.
Make the one you want.
That's what is know as "manless melancholia."
Well, she picked the most prosperous looking one.
If you're saying all this just because you don't want to tell me the truth, because you're hiding something from me, then maybe I can understand --
What is it but traveling from one place to another, taking pictures? It's just like being a tourist on an endless vacation.
Those high heels would be a lot of use in the jungle -- and those nylons and six-ounce lingerie --
Huh? Try and find a raincoat in Brazil. Even when it isn't raining  Lisa, on this job you carry one suitcase. Your home is the available transportation. You sleep rarely, bathe even less, and sometime the food you even look at when they were alive!
Don't you ever have any problems?
What's interesting about a butcher's knife and a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper?
Maybe she died.
There is -- I've seen things through that window! Bickering, family fights, mysterious trips at night, knives, saws, rope -- and since last evening, not a sight or sound of his wife! Now you tell me where she is and what she's doing!
What are you getting at?
Okay, chief. What's my next assignment.
Well, I guess it's safe to put on some lights now.
All day long I've tried to keep my mind on work.
And you, and you friend Doyle --  Did you hear from him again -- since he left?
But only her husband would know that.  And the jewelry! Women don't keep all their jewelry in a purse, all tangled, getting scratched and twisted up.
You said I'd have to live out of one suitcase  I'll bet yours isn't this small?
Weird.  Why don't I slip into something comfortable?
Of course, they have the same chance. They can look at me like a bug under glass, if they want to.
Whatever happened to that old saying "Love Thy Neighbor."
Did Mr. Doyle think I stole this case.
Do you like it?
Jeff, if you're squeamish, just don't look.
I'll try to give you at least fifteen minutes.
Shut up. I'm all right.
A man is assaulting a woman at one two five west ninth street. Second floor rear. Make it fast.
Buzzie--we better get out of here.
Feel okay?
What's happening?
You satisfied or you want more?
What you say your name was?
What time is it?
Mother--
Just give me a direct answer!  You going to stop me from going, Dad?
Well, just get it off your chest, son.
No.  I definitely don't.  I did the sa--
I guess when I nearly died giving birth to you--that shows how much I don't care!
Frank?  I'm frightened.
They not together, sir.  We don't see him in a long time now.
Oh, Mrs. Crawford don't believe in them!
Do you know why you shot those puppies, John?  Is that what they call you or do you have a nickname?
You remember me?
You shouldn't monkey with him.
He has a knife.
What?
I got to go in.  You better get home too.  Hey--what?
They're looking for you!--
Nobody talks to children!  They just tell them one thing and mean another.
We'll take it!
I came here before.
When I was here?  When I ran away. I used to run away a lot but they always took me back.
What you run out on me for!  What you leave me alone for?
You think the end of the world will come at nighttime, Jim?
No.
He's not saying that!  He's saying don't volunteer!
Too bad you didn't connect.  You could have gone to Juvenile Hall. That's what you want, isn't it?
Go on--don't give me that.  Someone giving you hard looks?
See?
Yeah--why--
Goodbye!  See you!
I swear, sometimes, you just want to hold onto somebody!  Judy, what am I going to do?  I can't go home again.
Why did you do that?
Of course.  Drown them like puppies.
How many rooms do you think there are?
Why?
Maybe he's scared of the dark.
Funny Jimmy.  You're so clean and you--this is silly.
I never felt so clean before.
I love somebody.  All the time I've been looking for someone to love me and now--I love somebody.  And it's so easy.  Why is it easy now?
No!
Don't give it a thought.  Only three million dollars a month!
Shall I show you the nursery?  It's far away from the rest of the house. If you have children--Oh I hate the word!--or if you decide to adopt one--they can carry on and you'll never even notice.  In fact, if you lock them in you never have to see them again, much less talk to them.
How did you know that?
But the same song.  I think it's fantastic!
Didn't you forget something?
Read a lot about you, Nick.
Read you're a man of some knowledge.
Gabriel! You said talk to him. That's all you ever said...
Searching for a money man...
We sell children's toys --
Negative five?
Saw my outfit or something, my coat --
Do that again.
No, c'mon --
Ashley, Jesus --
Ash... didn't you write me that you don't eat chocolate?
You need a COAT!
Well, I don't know about that --
We'll have more fun in Detroit.
I'm not him. I...  You want something from Nick, you got the wrong guy.
He'll kill you.
...maybe I die for Nick...
Bullets or no bullets, he won't do it.
WHERE'S THE FUCKING CASH, NICK!
You... you... YOU --
No --
You... you don't know me --
Where's she work?
Be more specific.
What's her greatest fear?
The hell you don't.
You wrote Ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working Christmas Eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. And the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. That a true story now?
I did.
What the fuck are you talking about.
We walked the place for a week.
Rather be back in the Mountain?
Do I get a country-western name?
Got something to say to me, Nick?
Can't be attracting attention, right?
You are lucky, convict. You're spending Christmas with the birthday boy himself --
Ash?
I can't go back to Vegas...
There's no snow in Vegas, 'kay? They don't know it, they don't want it, they got laws against the stuff. They got Egypt down there, right, they got Monte Carlo, Hawaii, they got ancient Rome, but where's the Winter Castle, right? Where's the Swiss miss Chalet? Where's the Big Fucking Igloo?
This trucker? Met a girl in a bar one night, she didn't know his situation. He's drunk, she's drunk, they get to mackin' hot and heavy and the woman swallows it. His tongue. Sucks it right down.
Thanks, sister. How are ya.
Hell yeah. You work here long?
What the hell was that about --
THERE ARE MONSTERS IN THE GELATIN!
Hot chocolate.
Why you gotta. We were gonna give you a ride someplace, man. Now I just don't know.
All I want... is to make it to Sidnaw, and sit down for Christmas dinner. Watch some ball with my old man, sleep in my old bed, and have leftovers for bout six months.
Don't move, Rudy!
Jesus, Rudy --
Tell her... I'll be there ...
Millie here used to serve drinks to these gunrunning truckers, real big talkers, talking bout a real score one day. I was in the Mountain, man, what the hell, why not let her get friendly with 'em? Let her tell 'em an idea she had, 'bout writing guys in prison. Getting one who could show 'em a sure thing.
They had the weapons and the willpower. We just gave them their inside man.
That was my king!
POP! That was My card!
Map is kinda dirty, Monster...
Without having them hit the alarms.
You fuckin' wish.
He is a motherfucker. He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job.
Jesus Christ, give me a fuckin' chance to breathe. I got a few questions of my own, ya know.
I'll call somebody.
I don't buy it. It doesn't make sense.
We can work this out, can't we?
The cops were there waitin' for us!
What the fuck d'you think we've been askin' each other?
Go ahead and laugh, you know what I mean. What a while bitch will put up with, a black bitch won't put up with for a minute. They got a line, and if you cross it, they fuck you up.
Nice Guy. When we got to the bar...
The Boots and Socks in Gardena. When we got there, I met Joe and a guy named Mr. White. It's a phony name. My name's Mr. Orange.
Who, Mr. White?
Me and Mr. White?
A little.
What's this?
Jesus Christ!
Mr. Brown?
Ain't that a sad truth. Remy Martin?
How is he?
Then one day she meets a John Holmes motherfucker, and it's like, whoa baby. This mother fucker's like Charles Bronson in "The Great Escape." He's diggin' tunnels. Now she's gettin' this serious dick action, she's feelin' something she ain't felt since forever. Pain.
Because you paid for the breakfast, I'm gonna tip. Normally I wouldn't.
I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it Joe; I'll give it back when we leave.
For the past fifteen minutes now, you've just been droning on with names. "Toby... Toby... Toby... Toby Wong... Toby Wong... Toby Chung... fuckin' Charlie Chan." I got Madonna's big dick outta my right ear, and Toby Jap I-don't-know-what, outta my left.
What for?
Two minutes, tops. It's a tough two minutes. It's daylight, during business hours, dealing with a crowd. But you'll have the guys to deal with the crowd.
Around twenty. Security pretty lax. They almost always just deal in boxes. Rough uncut stones they get from the syndicate. On a certain day this wholesaler's gettin' a big shipment of polished stones from Israel. They're like a way station. They are gonna get picked up the next day and sent to Vermont.
Okay ramblers, let's get to rambling. Wait a minute, who didn't throw in?
Your name's Freddy something.
What the fuck are they waiting for? That motherfucker cut off my ear! He slashed my face! I'm deformed!
You gonna bark all day, little doggie, or are you gonna bite?
Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you had a degree in medicine. Are you a doctor? Are you a doctor? Answer me please, are you a doctor?
I wasn't born yesterday. I'm hurt, and I'm hurt bad.
What happened?
Have you guys been listening to K- BILLY's super sounds of the seventies weekend?
Gun shot.
How the fuck do you think? The cops shot him.
Want a smoke?
As soon as I heard the alarm, I saw the cops.
Look, enough of this "Mr White" shit -
No real people?
At that point it became every man for himself. As far as Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't got the foggiest. Once I got out, I never looked back.
What do I think? I think the cops caught them, or killed 'em.
I got 'em, all right?
What?
Oh, you and Joe go back a long time. I known Joe since I was a kid. But me saying Joe definitely couldn't have done it is ridiculous. I can say I definitely didn't do it, cause I know what I did or didn't do. But I can't definitely say that about anybody else, 'cause I don't definitely know. For all I know, you're the rat.
I gotta take a squirt, where's the commode in this dungeon?
So, is he dead or what?
Assuming we can trust Joe, how we gonna get in touch with him? He's supposed to be here, but he ain't, which is making me nervous about being here. Even if Joe is on the up and up, he's probably not gonna be that happy with us. Joe planned a robbery, but he's got a blood bath on his hands now. Dead cops, dead robbers, dead civilians... Jesus Christ! I tend to doubt he's gonna have a lot of sympathy for our plight. If I was him, I'd try and put as much distance between me and this mess an humanly possible.
He got it in the belly. He's still alive, but won't be for long.
Is that supposed to be funny?
Not these guys.
You should be. Maybe Lednov heard about that Sonora ranch of yours.
We're going to look for him. Want to come along?
Anybody hurt?
What good is it going to do us to go to some ranch?
So am I.
Thanks. And isn't there something we can do about supper -- or making the beds?
But you eat, don't you?
If you were in his shoes would you take one of us home?
There's a nice boy.
Get back to the horses. They're straggling.
You don't have to explain. Did I tell you how grateful I am for what you've done?
You've earned it -- the horse ranch on the Toulomoe -- the girl in the spotted gingham.
She wears this gingham dress -- cooks popovers -- makes jam in season -- makes her own soap from pig fat and wood ashes and has cheeks the color of red apples.
Don't you trust me?
What did you expect? Speeches I don't mean?
Go on, take it. Then you can't spend the rest of the trip expecting to get paid.
I can't change either. Not unless somebody wants me enough to give me a hand.
Thanks for taking over.
I -- lost something.
Stretch out under the seat, Miss.
Like why you're buyin' a whole slew of 30 30 shells all of a sudden.
What was he in jail for?
Do you have to be so close-mouthed? I'm your brother. And I'm ridin' with you. Remember?
They were quite a ways off and the wind was blowin'. I didn't have them to aim.
Maybe you shoulda killed him.
Come on. We got a couple hours to eat and get some sleep.
You know what she asked me?
What did you come back for?
Is that the only reason you came back?
I can't take her with me.
You're not bein' quite fair.
You can't stay here. There's snakes and it's cold and you'll just get sicker.
Suppose that Lednov was to have found you, instead of me. Why you wouldn't have had a chance.
Helen -- why don't you and Mary go on with Clay?
Go away -- please.
Up here in the hills, a man gets a hankering to smell powder.
You're sure there's more where this came from?
There you are. Now take it easy and you'll be all right.
Clay could save us an awful lot of time.
You're not giving up?
-- Gaslights and a dance floor and a big bar. Cash registers with bells and a couple of boys with armbands just to keep 'em ringing. What do you think of that?
I'm sure of this. But not of you.  You won't open any joint. I've been watching you change. You're mad now and you think you can change back. But you can't. You'll end up making beds in a boarding house.
You said somebody was comin' back -- who's comin' back?
Is that your kind of reading, Steve?
It wasn't Clay's fault. We've been moving around most all the time -- mebbe when we get the ranch and stay in one place I can learn my letters then --
Maybe I could start you out.
Aren't we stayin'?
What comes after Z?
U-n-i-c-o-r-n-... What in heck's that?
What do they look like?
Nobody's gonna catch him sleeping. Don't worry about him.
Like when you were standin' there looking after Clay. I knew right off what you were thinking. Because I've been watching you.
Don't pay any attention to him. That's his way and I've found he's sure easy to get along with. I don't recollect him havin' hit me more'n a couple of times and I guess I had it comin'.
No, I won't let you do it.
Oh... I guess I'll die now.
Actually, I just met her. This is Alex.
Ouch!!
Hey, look, I'm Wilma Flintstone.
This house was built in 1898 by a man named Archibald Keaton as a gift to his wife, Cora.
You know, Buddy, about this friendship thing...
Oh yeah... another difference is she looks more sophisticated and classy. More feminine. And her tits are perfect. Not pointy and funny looking, or spaced too far apart...
We should act out our inner most fantasies.
What are we gonna do? I'm cold. I can't move, I'm so cold.
Cindy, let me...
You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...
What should we get?
Are you okay?
Oh, right.
This can't be happening?
What the hell are you doing?
Cool, but remember, as soon as he gets on the platform you gotta get out of there.  Nobody wants to go.
Father!
Left, right, left, right, crossover kick...
I'm telling you, it was possessed.
No, I'm just saying cats are known to be very territorial animals, and it is likely it did attack, but it doesn't mean it was possessed. Maybe the two of you should sleep together.
Good idea, and don't forget to give her a good-night kiss.
Got a problem with that?
I finished all the interviews.
Let me help you.
Yes. The scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for.
As I am sure you are aware, Professor, subjects who are close to death are statistically more likely to have the suggestibility required for paranormal investigation, which is, of course, why I've given them special consideration.
So, if one of our little chickadees is taking a shower which one of these buttons do I press to get a close- up?
Not to worry. There's been no reported activity in the house for over twenty years.
Professor, we need to talk.
The Professor might have everyone else fooled, but I know who the real brains of the operation is.
That's what turns me on about you, Dwight. You're so smart.
I supposed you'd like a leg. How about two?
A little bit... Give me your belt.
I'm so glad you're here.
It's okay. I understand.
Father.
Sit down and join us, Cindy.
Sorry, y'all. My bad.
"Fucked me."
"Ray!"
Aww, man. You just need to chill out. Come on, there's this party tonight it's gonna be fun. Lot's of alcohol and honeys.
Mrs. Sutphin?
0h, shit!
Bring her home... I guess.
I wouldn't give ya a nickel.
Sorry, ma'am.
Mrs. Jensen, I've told you. You have to rewind the tapes before returning them!
Bye, Birdie.  Chip, honey... I know it's hard being a teenager but I understand... I'm your mother and I love you.
In here, Mom...
I'm sorry he's dead, but... have you signed off yet?
Chip, your ride is here.
Yeah! Oohhhh! Get it!
You bitch!
The police are tracing your call right this minute.
FUCK YOU TOO, YOU ROTTEN WHORE!!
I know it's hard but we need the exact words.
MOTHERFUCKER!!
So you weren't drunk when you received those alleged obscene phonecalls?
Mr. Pickle! Did you see anybody in the booth next to you?
Who wants fruit salad?
Damn these yellow-jackets! I hate 'em!
You got your wish.
Did you find your Franklin Mint egg, Rosemary darling?
That was your People magazine with the letters cut out, wasn't it?
Oooohh! A fruit cake. Thank you, Mrs. Sutphin. Have a seat.
No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.
Murder, honey.
What was that?
I've been waitin' for you Miss Gibson. I want you to know I've decided to take your case.
Let's get out of here.
You're a curious man. You're willing to jeopardize Jacqueline's life in order to satisfy your own curiosity.
I don't get this. Miss Jacqueline was always so fond of you -- she was always talking about you -— had your picture in her office.
It's on Peary Street. Just ask the people who run it. They'll remember her.  People who see Miss Jacqueline never forget her.
I can't see much fun in teaching school. Why don't you go into the beauty business.
It always seemed to me she was sort of lonely and unhappy.
What were you talking about?
Nothing! That's absurd. I heard you laughing and talking, She was asking questions.
A man would look anywhere for her, Mary. There is something exciting and unforgettable about her -— something you never get hold of —- something that keeps a man following after her.
Afraid she might commit suicide?  People who commit suicide don't talk about it. That room made her happy in some strange way I couldn't understand. She lived in a world of her own fancy. She didn't always tell the truth. In fact -— I'm afraid she didn't know what the truth was.  There were many things about Jacqueline I didn't understand, and yet, without understanding, I had to be with her —— to see her —— to touch her —— in order to be happy. It's hard to explain to a youngster.
I'm sorry. I didn't intend to treat you like a child.
It's not much money, but it's enough to live on. You'd have to move out of that hotel and into a furnished room.
You've never believed a word I told you about Mr. August.
Who the devil is he?
I'm going to find your sister.
But I'm not joking.
Do you think he knows about this?
Could you find him?
She'll have to know some time.
You'll be all right?
Well,then I have spoiled your dinner -- "your food won't digest, and your wine will sour."
And you knew he'd be here.
I have been at the library.
I thought it would be, but just to be sure, I'll tell you that the Palladists are a society of Devil worshippers --
Oh, Mr. Jason. I really shouldn't be doing this, you know. It's against the rules.  When did you say you wanted them?
I saw you with her last week. I knew you'd be here tonight. Where is she?
Well, it won't work. Love and understanding won't make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet.
I'm afraid this is no time to play Cyrano, my friend. What was in your mind?
I've talked nonsense. I've scoffed and hooted -- but somewhere very deep down in me, I always felt that good held the balance of power.
I'm afraid not.
Yes.
I'll be out in a minute.
If I were you, Mary -- I'd go back to school. I'd make no further attempt to find Jacqueline.
I have no intention whatsoever of hinting. Your sister, Mary, is a murderess. She killed Irving August -- stabbed him out of fright when he discovered where she was hiding.
But she was here?
You mean she just came here, rented the room, locked it, and left?
We don't know, Mary. We've been unable to get in touch with your sister.
I'm worry to bother you. I want to ask you about my sister.
I thought you might know her. She was seen here about a week ago. Her name is Jacqueline Gibson.
Children, I want you to be very good and very quiet while I see Mrs. Wheeler a moment. She's going to take over this class for a while.
It is a very real danger and one which forces our decision.
Ann?
That was quick.
Do you have other things?
Graham is an unusual name.
This food is excellent.
Mother, father, sister.
Would you mind?
Can I tell you something personal? I feel like I can. It's something I couldn't tell John. Or wouldn't, anyway.
Do you understand what I'm trying to say?
Do you want them?
You are?
My therapist said that --
So you don't believe in therapy?
Of course not.
Oh, just a personal project like anyone else's personal project. Mine's just a little more personal.
What will you do when the money runs out?
Tell me your name.
Do you talk to him?
So you do fantasize?
About who?
Have you fantasized about me?
I remember. You could do that, couldn't you? Go down on me?
If I asked you to, would you? Not on tape, I mean?
Can't.
No, it was wonderful. That wasn't the problem.
I loved her for how good she made me feel, and I hated her for how good she made me feel. And at that time, I tended to express my feelings non- verbally. I couldn't handle anyone having that much control over my emotions.
Now I make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me.
If you do get out of your marriage, will you continue to be inhibited?
Subtlety?
And you feel the same way with John?
But if you were?
I've told you.
You mean you're still in contact with her?
But why can't you just put it all behind you? Can't you just forget it? All that stuff you did?
Graham...
That's the first thing that ran through my mind when I saw you. I thought this is not the same man that rode the unicycle naked through the homecoming parade.
Graham and I were talking about apartments and I told him to check the Garden District, there are some nice little places there, garage apartments and stuff.
Something wrong?
I'm not either!!
Loud.
Goddam right.
You son of a bitch!!
Are you afraid of his reaction? Of his finding you silly for thinking of such things?
What do you mean?
Well, I kind of tried once. It just seemed stupid, I kept seeing myself lying there and it seemed stupid, and kind of, uh, I don't know, and then I was wondering if my dead grandfather could see me doing this, and it just seemed like a dumb thing to be doing when we don't know what to do with all that garbage, you know?
Well, I don't know. The week started off okay, but then I was outside watering the plants, and I started feeling dizzy from the heat and that got me thinking about the Greenhouse Effect, so I went inside and turned on the air-conditioner full blast, and that made me feel a little better until I started thinking about radon leakage coming up through the floor, and --
No, he left last week.
What do you mean, like physically?
I'm glad you feel that way, because I feel that way, too.
What?
I say it because it's descriptive.
Well, I'll call him when he does.
Oh, please. Okay, so give me the Zen master's address, I'll think of a reason to stop by.
Lose something?
Are you getting Mom something for her birthday?
I don't... he doesn't want you to come over.
No, I didn't.
No!
I don't want to talk about it.
What!?
Well, it's too late now, isn't it?
In front of him, Ann, yes.
You couldn't do it, period.
I get real busy between two and four.
Bye.
Did he ask me to take my clothes off? No, he didn't.
No, I touched me.
She called you that, too. May I ask why you're here?
I just want to know why you're here.
How did you find me?
Nope. I think the man is a liar.
You just want to ask me questions?
Would anybody else see the tape?
Can I see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what --
Do I sit or stand?
I'd rather sit. Are you ready?
Would you like me to take my pants off?
John doesn't have sex with Ann anymore.
No. You'll have to get somebody else.
Ouch. Okay, I deserved that. Cynthia, don't you understand? After the first time it's just not spontaneous. There's no edge anymore. Look at the tapes, there is only one date on each label. I have never taped anyone twice.
Hello.
John?
How about inviting me over to dinner?
Well, this is timely. Your wife is here, would you like to speak to her?
Shit, after what you've told me, I don't know. I should've known, when he showed up dressed like some arty brat.
What if this tape gets into the wrong hands?
She's a grown-up, she can handle it.
No.
It won't. I trust him.
No, he didn't put me up to this. Jesus, I don't need people to tell me what I should do. I've just been thinking about things, that's all.
I know. Will you please leave now?
Plenty of room for two people.
Especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry.
Hi, John.
God, you need help.
No.
Your keys, asshole!! Your two fucking keys!! Give them to me!!
IBM.
...probably nothing at all. It's probably just a bunch of, I don't know, fatty cysts. You can have them removed in a doctor's office. Has Nick seen a doctor?
Hi.
Oh, you feel very good, Betts. You have such a cosy body. I'm jealous, I'm so skinny.
Did you touch anything? Move anything before we got here?
And that was her. Annabelle Horse... field.
Is that the man who called you up here?
Mrs. Ementhal's ready and waiting, Doctor.
Kiss, kiss?
Forsythe, Forsythe! What's wrong? What's happened?
I don't know. I just thought I might want to call you. I don't know.
You will make love to me, won't you, Janine? Won't you make love to me? You start it. Won't you? I think I've forgotten how to start.
She had a couple just like them. Right here near her belly button. You could push 'em around. I thought they were kinda sexy, myself.
Didn't seem worried about them.
Not exactly the kind of lunch Hobbes would have laid on you, Rog, but it's all I got, and...  ...all I got I share with you. Go ahead. Take all you want.
You put the bug into the body of a man with a diseased kidney, the bug attacks the bad kidney, dissolves it, it's assimilated by the body, and now you got a perfectly good parasite where you used to have a rotten kidney. I know what you're gonna say. You're gonna say it's crazy.
It was women did it to Hobbes. Couldn't handle them. That girl, that Annabelle -- talk about crazy projects.
But you'll think about what I said about working together, huh?
I've got a date with one of them at ten. Can you make it?
OK. It's apartment 1009, South Tower, Starliner Towers. May as well go there directly.
NIGHT NIGHT
BREAKING OUT
Later, Brenda.  Ah, Bert, could you spare a moment?
Sank you!  Velcome!  Sank you!
I know he's boring but... Neuro-specialists!  That sounds pretty drastic.
Is it because I'm becoming too popular?
Right!  An early start with Janet's debut on 'Good Morning Denton.' By the time we unveil Farley's 'Faith Factory' we will have earned our beauty sleep.
But...how?
SIN-I-FUL
With Fast Food Farley at the helm it'll be TV dinners from now on.
Look.  Look at that.  Bert Schnick can see.  Why...he's...dancing.
Care to indulge?
Betty, it's imperative we get Janet out of Flavors' fast fingers and Brad out of that hell-hole before they both disappear forever. If only I could place that name -- McKinley?
President?  Past Presidents! Betty, this is beginning to add up.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR ENSLAVEMENT
That's us.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR COMPASSION
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR IMPROVEMENT
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR ENJOYMENT
Mental instability?
We've heard rumors that you're going to unveil more than just a new series tonight.  Is this true?
It's only one night, Janet. Let's not forget who we're doing this for?
Oh my poor baby.
You shouldn't have said that.
I NEED SOME
Is it true they're all midgets with big heads?
F for...
This is the nerve center of operations, Janet.  You must stay here tonight.  That way we can all be here when Mr. Sun paints us a new day with his golden brush.
I FEEL THE HEAT FROM YOUR SKIN AND THE STUBBLE ON YOUR CHIN YOU'RE NO GOOD
WHAT A JOKE...
Hi!  Macy Struthers -- co-host on the F. F. show.
And we also know how you feel, we're not strangers to confusion.
The problem with that is that then there's one extra --
I'm not going to call every five minutes, but this is important.
My condolences.
Lot of good stuff.  Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?
You got it.
And what was that other one you did, the one where you're the jogger?
Two years ago, buddy.
Hey, guys. How's it going?
You know a gal named Maya? Works at the Hitching Post?
How you doin' tonight, beautiful?
Great. You look great.  You both do.
I'm thinking about the duck breast.
What happened to you guys?
Highliner, please.
Are you a writer too?
That's hilarious. You sound just like one of those guys.
Whatever you girls want. It's on us tonight. Sky's the limit.
Come on. You're fucking hungover.
Why did you tell them my book was being published?
Don't open that now. It's warm.
Shut up.  Here's to a great week.
Oh, that's tasty.
Did you read the latest draft, by the way?
What?
Hey, Miles. I really hope your novel sells.
Doesn't have to be now. Let's go taste.
Baked with a butter-lime glaze.
This is rose, right?
That's what you do with every one.
Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff.
Here's to my last week of freedom.
Ooooooohh. Now we're getting somewhere.
I'm trying to get you some action, but you've got to help me out just a little bit.
Single. Waitress. Getting off work. Looking for love. A little slap and tickle.
Victoria and I used to like this view.  Once we had a picnic here and drank a '95 Opus One. With smoked salmon and artichokes, but we didn't care.
She what?  When?
Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out!
You gotta excuse him. Yesterday he didn't know Pinot Noir from film noir.
And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot.
Where were you?
Stop it. You are blowing a great opportunity here, Miles. Fucking Maya, man. She's great. She's cool. She's funny. She knows wine. What is this morose come-down bullshit? These girls want to party. And what was that fucking ten-minute lecture on, what was it, Vouvrays? I mean, come on!
Goddamn, Miles, she is nasty. Nasty nasty nasty.
You should call her.
What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine.
You said she was shallow. Yeah, and a nouveau riche.
She likes you, man. Stephanie'll tell you.
You know, in life you gotta strike when the iron's hot.
What about your agent? Hear anything yet?
Don't come over the top. Stay still.
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! What's the matter with you, man? SHUT UP!
I said okay?
Yo! Yo! Here's my boy! Here's my boy! Who's your daddy, boy? Who is yo' daddy?
So tell me everything. Details. I like details.
This whole week has gone sour. It isn't turning out like it was supposed to.  I want to go home.
You ever actually been in there, Miles?
Tastes like the back of a fucking LA schoolbus. Probably didn't de-stem, hoping for some semblance of concentration, crushed it up with leaves and mice, wound up with this rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash bullshit. Fucking Raid.
Aren't you glad you didn't move up here and marry her?
She gets off in an hour, so I think I'm just going to have a drink and then... make sure she gets home safe.
No. She ordered them special. Took her forever to find them. They've got this design on them with dolphins and our names engraved in Sanskrit. We've got to go back. Christine'll fucking crucify me.
Please, Miles, please.
She tell you she was married?
Want me to drive?
Uh-uh. You're on your own.
I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight?
Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?
Hi.
Seriously, the '61s are peaking, aren't they? At least that's what I've read.
It might be too late already. What are you waiting for?
Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but this is tasty. Really good. How about you?
You got kids?
Yeah, weird. But great.
I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did.
Okay. See you around.
I had class.
No, we've got to get back Friday for the rehearsal dinner.
Victoria! How the hell are you?
Ken.
I guess I just thought there was still some hope for us somewhere down the road and I just, I just --
Since the last time we spoke? I don't know. Could be better. Could be worse.
You quit drinking?
French or American?
Where's Jack?
Huh.
Oops. Sorry.
Me? No, I think it's kind of a stupid game. I mean, at least, I could never get into it. I tried it once.
Hi, guys. We should probably get going.
It was a surprise, Mom.
Yeah, well. You know, Jack's pretty eager to get up to... you know, but, uh, yeah. We'll see how it goes.
No.
It's not contaminated. It's just tap water. Pour it in his bowl.
Not English though. You heard the voices right Uncle Merrill?
...Tell Graham --
And tell Merrill to swing away.
I'm not going to curse.
It doesn't sound natural when I curse.
Explain noises.
It was very dark.
Pharmacy crowded?
Do you think it's a possibility?
Do you feel comforted?
That's a game isn't it?  Anyway...  There's been some interesting developments.
They're on the roof.
He was only a year and half old.
Merrill!
They're distracting us?
It's getting stronger.
They're broadcasting...
No.
That's good enough for me.
Graham.
Dad.
They said one of two things could happen. One, they fight and are defeated and leave to return again with full forces hundreds or even thousands of years later.
What do you think about the idea that they don't like places near water, and we might be safe from them near a lake or something?
What about them?
It's not broken.
I don't know whether to look for a midget or a --
Okay.  So he was tall?
There was an accident. Drunk driving. They weren't sure.
She's not in an ambulance Father.
Is that him?
Some guy had a sign that said it was the end of the world.  Nothing really bad is going to happen, is it Uncle Merrill?
I think we lost 'em.
After the war my family worked a little piece of land near Savannah for a while. But the way it was down there then... well, they made it hard every way they could. Finally my daddy figured the promised land was out this direction. By that time I was so sick of farming, I didn't want to touch another hoe ever. I wouldn't come with 'em. My daddy took it pretty hard. Him, my ma, and my little sister headed out without me. They've got a little place south of Silverado. I guess they've done okay. Good enough anyway so that when my ma wrote me last time, she said they needed my help to work the place. That was almost nine months ago she wrote. Letter took a while to find me, but when it did, it was just the right time.
Where are we?
This was my father's. The men who killed him took it.
I gotta get to my brother. If they came after me, they'll want him too.
More than enough.
I guess tomorrow at dawn he'll be proved right.
Me, I'm riding along, minding my own business. Four cowboys come by and we decide to ride together for a while, friendly as can be. I always figure you might as well approach life like everybody's your friend or nobody is... don't make much difference. We get out in the middle of that frying pan and suddenly everybody's pointing their gun but me. I guess they admired my horse. She's a great one, a sweet little bay.
I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy.
They got a saloon there?
I hate to see any man swing. Bad luck.
You know, hanging around with you is no picnic.
What happened?
They're drawn to me by that. But it never lasts.
Didn't he tell you about Blind Pete?
That's the longest I ever did it. 'Bout bust a gut.
That's what you said in Turley. You remember how that ended.
You misunderstand. I want you out of town. In fact, I want you all the way out of my jurisdiction.
Hello, Rae.
Rae, all we got is each other.
You got a place to stay?
Good old Paden. I was hoping you'd changed your mind about the job.
Easy, boy. Just an idea.
I thought we talked about that.
You gotta calm down, Paden. Everything will be put straight in a few days.
You work here?
You wouldn't be needing any help around here, would you? Maybe with the gambling?
Where's the dog now?
You sure? Maybe that's the kind of friend I am.
Some people think because they're stronger -- or meaner -- they can push you around. I've seen a lot of that. But it's only true if you let it be. The world is what you make of it.
It's an advance. We want him to know he's going to be happy here.
But not everyone's imaginary, are they, Mr. Taransky?  I refer, of course, to Edith.
-- Do you know what these are, Elaine?
-- It's called a projector.
Listen, Viktor, I have good memories of those days too -- but this isn't about that or you or me or some high-minded ideal.  This is business.
I'm not taking away your daughter, just your deal.  You and I both know, after the divorce I kept you on for old time's sake, so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.  I called what's his name at Warner's.  He said he'd take a meeting -- in July.  I've fought for you Viktor...  You want to talk severance?
Don't be ridiculous.  I arranged a press conference.
Sorry I didn't get her back in time.
Really?  Oh, so she's really going to do all this nudity?
Hair and make-up?
She was in the theater?  When? Where?
As I've tried to explain to you, Elaine.  Simone isn't like any other actress you've ever known. She's about the work and only the work -- lives for the work.  She wants all the money up there...  ... on the screen where it belongs. She'd work for scale except I know you only respect people you pay a fortune.
Not today.  She's learning her lines.  You can also take cue cards and teleprompter out of the budget.
Experience, Viktor.  I've seen this a hundred times -- young stars destroying the very people who discovered them.  I'm worried about you, that's all.  This woman -- she controls your destiny.
Maybe you're right.  Twelve years after your daughter's born you decide to become a father.
I'd love to tell her myself.  When are you going to let me meet her?
Are you and Simone...  ... getting married?
My two favorite girls.
Elaine, it's Wednesday.
I'm sure you'll keep her focussed. She's lucky to have you, Viktor.  Is she really having your baby?
-- She already is.  Simone's not coming over, Elaine.  Not tonight, not ever.  I want you back, Elaine.
Who says that -- ?  -- Never mind.  You have to listen to me, Elaine.  Simone is thin air, pixels, molded by me from a mathematical equation.  I inherited it from a madman -- I can show you --
Thank Simone for the tickets.
You had no choice, Elaine.  He's a liability.
I can't believe she's doing this -- taking advantage of him this way. It's cruel.
"Why are we here?  Is that what you're asking, Jack?... Why are we here?  No why.  Just here".
Well, no one could accuse you of being over-exposed, Simone.  Why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight?
No, I'm okay.
Sure.  Where would you like to start?
The film.  The chemistry.  No reflections on Nicola but Simone and I -- we were just so right together.
Yes, perfect.  As a matter of fact, I ran into Simone on the lot the other day.
Absolutely not!
-- No.  No.  A real wall.  You ran right through it.
Is she here?
Not like this --
-- Flesh is weak.
You already do.  But my actor won't get old, fat, lazy or drunk -- won't throw tantrums, demand a body double, script changes or a bigger trailer.  The Disney Corporation has been using artificial actors for years.
An eye -- for performance.  You know the truth when you see it.  I know.  I've seen your movies.  I love your movies.
Do I hear the sound of... wedding bells?
Not quite how I imagined it --
Good-night, Daddy.
You know me -- married to my work.
-- I can't accept it.  I don't want a car, Dad.
The old Viktor Taransky.  I liked you better before -- before all this.  You were a loser, Dad, but at least you had integrity.  I can't stand to see you like this -- clinging to Simone's coattails -- it used to be about the work, and now it's all about her.  And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
Alright, Sayer, you've got a deal.
Is it a jamming device?
Am I wasting my time with you? When she sues to protect her privacy, she'll have to appear in a public courtroom to do it.
-- I've been here before! -- On my honeymoon with my ex-wife.
I beg you.  You can't do this to me.
You could play the lead.
Yes, of course it is.  You know you have a line here.  Not a wrinkle.  Actually, more of a dimple.  I've been thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
No one came in or went out just like you said, Mr. Taransky.
You mean they buy it?
I am the death of real.
Are you calling me?
That's very sweet. I'm okay.
Your eye frames. They don't seem to have any lenses in them.
What was that you were saying before with your soldiers? Day pro fun.
I got an award once. From the Mayor.
No.
No.
We were supposed to draw a picture. Anything we wanted... I drew a man. He got hurt in the neck by another man with a screwdriver.
You want to ask me a question?
Where should I look then, Cole?
He hates me.
...So your dad lives in Pittsburgh with a lady who works in a toll booth.
That isn't magic.
Your father ever tell you bedtime stories?
What makes you think that?
I don't know how the story ends. I hope it's a happy ending.
I told you what I want.
I'm going to transfer you. I know two psychologists that are exceptional--
Something happened, didn't it?
You have nice red in your cheeks now.
I wish I were somewhere else.
You were great in the play, Cole.
A lady. She died.
Where is she?
What are you thinking, Momma?
She wanted me to tell you--
I don't like people looking at me like that.
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
I work at an insurance place and at Penny's, so Cole can go to that good school.
Your pa's waiting for you up at the house.
Your grandfather sure believed in it. Worked pretty good... too.
Yo. "Billy Bob". Was I two beats behind, or what?
Bitch.
You have a strong unfufilled desire.
Aha. The Lovers.
Suzie???
Carl, what are you doing?
You're not going to arrest me for it, are you?
Thought your boy and his band were only staying the night.
That's not patricide. Patricide is when you gun down your old man.
The ancient Aztecs knew how powerful this stuff was.
Are you crazy?
He means moon shining.
Joseph Macdonald... Your son.
I came back for the funeral. That's all.
How... was she "called?"
Was. You ain't afraid of ghosts, now are you?
Old slave superstition. You sprinkle a little blood mixed with water on the crops, you get yourself a good harvest... So they say.
Sure. What do you want to know.
It's time to make amends.
Jesus. What a bunch of useless zombies.
Hey. Could you be a little more insensitive? We're on our way to a funeral for Crissake.
Asphyxiation. Choked to death on a ham sandwich. Next.
You wanna know the difference? The difference is that you're screwing up the song.
Yes!
Yeah. That's just the problem.
What about Jeremiah?
Think of it... as a threesome. You. Me. And... "Jethro."
We're almost ready. What the hell are you doing out here?
Strange... I can feel my old self coming back...
Suzie --
Suzie... No.
No --
Get out of here.
...no... Mac... p-please...
Yeah. Great work, Rod. But next time, it would be nice... if you could JOIN US FOR THE ENTIRE SET!
-- Where have you two been?
Shit.
Bill, this Brenda's Randy Flagg's niece. We need to find Grant yesterday! The town council has lit a Roman candle and stuck it up my ass!
That young lady heard you say 'squid.' She's gonna go out and create a Goddamn hysteria!
Don't worry. The lurker ain't around. I checked.
Sorry.
Mm hm. But only a few folks know how to get there. Wally. Rollo Linkski coulda taken you, but 'course he got hit by that train. Me.
No reception out here.
Was always curious why you... married Grant in the first place... Just never seemed outta love.
My father, he was -- he was real close to evil. People didn't know. Still don't. From the time I was a toddler he'd beat the hell out of me. I don't mean just like a smack for smart--mouthing... he took a real enjoyment in it. And when I turned eleven or twelve, things... well, they got worse. Starla looks at Bill, who seems struck.
That wasn't a good night, no.
What are you doing?!
We can probably get some first aid and food at this gas station up here.
We'll just head up here into Bishopville, get checked up in the hospital. Then maybe we'll head off to Hollywood after all, huh?
He's a fucking Martian?!
When I buy my zoo, I'm leaving them things the hell out!
Some kids found her necklace near Tipper Creek, as well as what might be her blood on a rock.
I think we best get you to a hospital right quick.
Slugs? No. 'Less you talkin' about that new waitress down at Sloan's! Ha ha!
Hey there, Chief.
Megan Halesy' little sister.
You're lookin' awful pretty.
Thinkin' 'bout getting me a couple of these big ol' rib eyes.
Grant, no -- I'm sorry, I'm just -- I'm not in the mood. Grant is on top of her, breathing a little too heavy. GRANT Come on, baby, it's --
Flip.
Yeahhhh. I'm sorry. I just got so excited about... your present.
You're my princess, aren't you?
Grant. Oh my God. What happened to your -- ?
I'll get if for you.
Maybe you better sit back down. You don't look so good.
Just the man who's gonna see you driven to your knees! Sheriff Buell Clayton from Texas.
You're crazy, man. Smart dresser, but crazy.
You got my barley pop?
Look, I'm a twenty-eight year old hoofer who spends most of her time with fags. Besides, I'm impulsive. It runs in the family. We're all crazy. Mind if I smoke?  Anyway, today was the 'bid day.' But as I was walking down the aisle, I realized this is total insanity. What am I going to do in Texas the rest of my life? I can't marry Jerry Jeff. I mean, we're eventually gonna have to talk. So, halfway down the aisle, I turned and split. You think I'm nuts, right?
Why? You have a bowling date?
Who'd want to?
No. I want to know what you think about besides ditching Smokey?
Is this fun?
You know, you're not a bad driver.
That's a Texas cop. What the hell's he doing in Arkansas?
See ya, Kate.
What the hell are you doing?!?
You know this guy, don't you?
Mississippi's the other way!
An unmarked police car.
I'm sure the Arkansas Bears put out an all-points.
I'm proud of you.
-- Actually, my heaviest relationship was with a rock singer named Ramblin' Bobby Holt. When I turned twenty- one, I went to Europe with visions of being free and independent. My luck, he was on the plane. I landed in Paris and fell in love before I could claim my baggage.  We were together for almost a year. I thought he was it.
I should've told you, but you would've thrown me out, right?
What do you want me to do, Hot Pants? Beg?
That means we gotta average ninety- four miles per.  Forget it.
Believe me, man; Fred'll be no problem.
We gotta let the slack out, Cledus; this is costing us time.
All right, here's our plan of communication, so as to avoid Smokey.
If I say go to twenty-one, go to nineteen.
Let's get the hell outta here.
Thirty-eight minutes ahead of schedule.
What's a Texas Smokey doing in Arkansas, man?
My vocal cords are fine, but Fred's ain't. He's been barking, eating the seats and driving me crackers.  Hear that? Where's his chow?
As far as John Law knows, I'm just a joy ridin' Georgia redneck. We keep 'em outta your backyard, we're cool.  Now just give me five to ditch this idiot and I'll meet you in Ole Miss.
-- Gimme a twenty, pardner.
-- But everytime we've ever messed up, it's because your rhyme's over- ruling your reason. I know you think you're God's gift to waitresses, but...
We're outta motion lotion.
How's the clock, Bandit II.
When we agree to do a job, we do it. Right?
Bandit, I just thought I'd lay a Smokey report on you.
Breaker. Breaker.
Breaker, Breaker. This is Bandit I, coming up on a portable gas station. Do you copy?
It ain't ever been done before, hot shit.
Have any trouble getting here?
Uh-uh. What Cobra?
Listen, pardner; this ain't no time to be getting laid.
Shut up, Fred.
Yeah, Bandit II, Que pasa?
I'm Kate. You must be Cledus.
I still think this whole idea is dumb, pop.
-- Did ya hear they nailed the Bandit?
It's gotta be tough keeping an eye on everything.
Yes, but no -- we have personnel stationed at both ends of that hall, twenty-four hours a day.
Is your security team armed?
Maroon uniforms?
How bad?
Yeah, ye-- I -- uh, there were, earlier, there was that guy Carrut--
-- run both those names through the D.C. database. Call San Francisco, see if they've got anybody in the field doing collateral inquiries for --
You investigating those murders out at the lake?
Yeah, shit -- hell, you're right. I'm sorry.
Two of 'em?
Are you on a land line?
-- Forget about the tissue damage you're doing to the heart itself. Sustained cocaine abuse will segue you from a very painful ventricular fibrillation into full cardiac arrest.  Buddy, nobody knows about your condition, or your drug use. Why you lied to me, knowing that I'd find out anyway, I'll never know, but it imperative now that I see you.
There are certain meds, certain intravenous measures that can counteract some of the damage you've done, but I'd have to administer them myself.
I'm here, where's the car?
What happened?
His law firm, same one that hired me. Israel walked out after he made bail and nobody's seen him since.
So I guess you're not going.
No, what did you say on the machine?
I could have it sent out...
Y'ain't never had to wash another man's blood off, dig it out y'fingernails... Y'had us for that. Y'ain't ever made a real beef on y'own, shit as light in the ass as you are, I'll bet you ain't ever made anything more than a fuck'n fist your whole life.  So if you think I'mma let your lil' punk-ass, with the dirt I've done for you, in the eleventh hour, sell me off like some fucking field nigger, hand me up to the Feds like y'last chip, then you done gone straight out-your-motherfucking MIND!
So he's personally issued the contract on Israel?
On an extradition flight back to El Salvador, he murdered a security detachment and vanished.
What the hell -- What is this!? People died. Agent Carruthers is dead!
I can't discuss --
...while Carruthers and a dozen others lie dying, you debate semantics. The Bureau's betrayed us...  The way they betrayed him...
Alright, now Buzzy -- this is, this is it, here, okay, so listen to me careful and wait till I'm finished 'cuz we got no room for slop.
Okay, he's gonna clip Israel, I just gotta outta there --
No question, no, you're right. We gotta do what's good for us now.
That's not a problem. Are we goin' outta pocket ourselves?
Shoot.
-- No, no, not when y'can see the shore. I hear ya.
-- never in a million girl --
No doubt. That's my moms there, taught me them skills.
It's going around ain't it? Mafuckas catching bullets like the common cold up in this bitch.  I think I accidentally shot and killed my boy today.
That takes some of the sting out.
Why?
Jus' remember, this is more rescuin' shit than rampagin' shit... What are you shootin'?
You got the fifty up? Bitch y'tryin' t'take down a jumbo jet? Blown the moon out the sky? T'fuck you wanna get that grimy?
...So you heard from Keith? He still fuckin' with that 'lil light-skinned girl?
I'm not givin' it up jus' yet...
...Shhhhhhit... girl, there's these two dudes, just sittin' here in this elevator, all shot up...
They musta been beefin' big time with one another, cuz this shit, got way past words, whatever it was.
Bulllllshit...
You're being tricked.  Sartorius picked a fight with you to avoid telling you about his idea for getting rid of the visitors.  He's figured out they're made of subatomic particles called neutrinos, and he's going to create a negative neutrino field.  Twenty four hours a day, until they're back on Earth.
I want to hear your version.
Where's his body?
She'll come back.
You didn't bring any chocolate, did you?
I can't talk just now.  I'm too tired.
How long can you go without sleep?
Kelvin, you awake?
We can liquidate the station.  Take the Athena back.
What happened?
Kelvin, she'll disintegrate.  You don't believe me?  Let's radio that shuttle pod you launched -- better yet, let's go get it.  I've charted it's trajectory, only take a few hours...
Who are you trying to please? Yourself?  Her?  Which her, this one or that one.  Can you face both?  We are in a situation that is beyond morality.  So: Leave with her.  You'll see the transformation.
Jesus...
Oh, God.  I'm awake.
"And Death Shall Have No Dominion".
What do you remember?
Is it a planet?
Then it's God, right?
Where've you been?
Thinking what you were doing and saying, just being consumed by thinking of you.  I loved it so much, that feeling.
What does Snow think you should do?
You feel sorry for Solaris, or for me?
What's wrong.
I'm sure there are worse people to talk to, but I don't know who they are.
Was she right?
You don't want me.
I have these strange thoughts, I don't know where they come from.  I can't explain it.
But that's what happened before.
Please don't lie.  I told you before, I don't know how I came to be here. Whatever you think you can't say to me, I need to hear you say it.
Listen: I don't care about anything but the fact that you are here.  You are her, you are Rheya.
Chris, I had to.  I had to.  I didn't think you'd react like this.
Chris --
Chris, please.  Chris, I'm serious. I won't make it.
What do I have to do to stop it?
I... I am Rheya.  But I am not the woman you loved ten years ago.
I think they help.
It put you here.  I'll admit it, it acted like a God and put you here, put you into my consciousness.  I was asleep, and it put you into my dream.  I saw your mouth.  And there you were.  Whether you've been sent here to make me happy or punish me, it doesn't matter.  The decision we make now is all that matters.  Stay with me.
Last night.  You were talking to someone in the corridor.
Followed by non-human manifestations.
It's terrific Win.
Straight ahead.
Uh...
Are you nervous?
Hi.  Just checking to see if you're here.
You all right?
I'm sorry about what happened.
He said he'd kill me.
... It was like... the minute I saw her... I knew.  She looked so damn adorable in a cop's uniform... puttin' on a big, tough act...
Yeah.  It was.
No dog.
Stop, will you?!
Are you okay?
Oh yeah.  When is it?  This thing in Queens.
What a memory.
I'd miss my life...
... Mike.
I'll miss you, Mike.
Mom, what's going to happen with you and Dad?
Hey, can we go to McDonald's?
My ass if falling.
I read the article.  You didn't tell me she was so beautiful.
Okay?
Honey.  You got him.
She's got to identify him.
I'd identify him.
What's wrong with your paisley tie?
Did you hear what I said?
C'mon, don't make an issue of it. Do you want the fucking meatloaf or not?
What was that?
I already did.  I mean, I talked to his wife, and she talked to him...
Let me drive...
Ellie...
I don't know how you did it, but whatever it was, keep doing it.
I asked for the man in charge...
You should'a brought the girl.
Bullshit!  Prove it.
Get that gun away from his head, or I'll keep her from coming in!  Put the gun on me, he can't hurt you! He's tied up!  Put him under the table!
Watch your step!
How are things going, pal?
What!  What kind of pathetic line is that?
What, want a glass?
Ah, ya know.  Neighborhood's not what it used to be.  Kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day.
S'funny.  When your mom and dad, uh, passed away, I had this idea. I wanted you to be the best baseball player in the world.
When you won that scholarship, I was proud of you.
Yeah, take pity on the feeble minded.
Flash, drop it--
Hey, guys.  Check it out-- I saw this dud on the tube last night. He is incredibly cool.
You maniac.  You'll blow your scholarship.
What's in there?
Oh, I need your notes from the classes I missed.
Now tell me you love me.
You taking extension classes, Mr. Jameson?
I bet you don't think I appreciate you, Parker.  I do.
I got a question, college boy.  What the hell am I supposed to do with these!?  I ask for disaster, pathos, what do I get?  Salvador Dali!  When I want artsy-fartsy double-exposures, I'll ask for--
I don't give a gerbil's ass how you got 'em!  I can't print this surreal garbage!
Would you cool it already?
No refund on the mask, y'know. Health laws.
An even five I throw in the jacket.
Is that bug juice, or are you just glad to see me?
I see.  So, Amazing Spider-Man-- I'll assume that's not your given name--
No.  I was lying about the coffee.
I suppose.
Eugene.  Admit it, Peter-- you'd do anything for a nickname like "Flash."
What's in the bag?  Garbage?
-- but at least Aunt May's okay now. I really have to stop by the hospital this afternoon.
You were the last one to see Thorkel.  In Octavius' hospital room.
Toxic dumps, huh.
Yeah, Roz.
Roz? Rosomoff?  What is it?
There's nothing in there worth stealing!
What the hell is that?
Proof.  Proof of a unified field. Not just theory and equations-- experimental proof.
Then the alumni reports came in-- fund-raising is down this year.
Otto, we are mere mortals. You must never forget your own limits--
Mr. Parker.
How much do you know about it?
Really.  I'd like to speak with him.
Kid, you were terrific.  Max Reiss, novelty acts.  Was that judo or something?  Ah, skip it.  Question is, can you do it again?
No…
Why? It is a wrestling match, or…
So they're airing this tonight?
Mr. Reiss-- I need a quarter--
Spider-Man, be careful!  He's quite mad.
Professor, you ever fly one of these things before?
Up here, Docky Ocky!
Don't let him kid you. Cagney couldn't have pulled a sweeter job.  All right, boys. We were waiting in the depot in Frankfurt, see? And there was an ammunition train coming through, the longest ammunition train you ever saw, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room, see? Fixes himself a time bomb, busts open the window and just as the train moves out, lays the thing in there, see? So then, he comes out like nothing's happened and three minutes later you can hear it -- boom! Broke every window in Frankfurt. It was gorgeous!
Jawohl.
Throws what? How could he have a time bomb?
I had to be the ham! I had to shoot off my mouth!
Ready?
How did he get over there?
Then we're all in on it?
You killed them, huh? Both of them?
Come on, Schulz! Spill it! How did you get the information? About Manfredi and Johnson? About the stove and the tunnel? Who's giving it to you? Which one of us is it?
Who doesn't! Suppose we wait until we hit the Waldorf Astoria.
105-353.
I'll live.
I don't know what you're talking about, Colonel.
Ever try forty sleeping pills?
You have no idea how boring my life here is. If it weren't for an occasional air raid or some foolish prisoners trying to escape, I wouldn't know what to do. I want to thank you for keeping me company. I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't read. I hate music. That only leaves good conversation. It will be a shame to lose you.
As for the blankets, you will notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool.
Whatever it is, it's out of your jurisdiction. This man is not a prisoner of war. Not any more. He is a saboteur.
And the way you search your prisoners, it does sound rather unlikely.
You were saying --?
Jawohl?
Hey, Schulz! I got a deal for you. Suppose you help us escape. We'll go home and have everything ready for you in Madison Square Garden. For the world championship! Schulz, the Beast of Bavaria versus Halitosis Jones!
Hey -- Russki -- Russki! Look at those bublichkis! Over here!
No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on!
You want Betty Grable!
Animal! When the war's over, remember I told you I'd fix you up with Betty Grable!
How? We go to California. I got a cousin that's working for the Los Angeles Gas Company. That's how we get the address, see? Isn't that clever? I take you up to her house and ring the doorbell and say, 'Congratulations, Miss Grable. We have voted you the girl we'd most like to be behind barbed wire with, and I'm here to present the award'.
Ain't that too bad! Tomorrow he'll have to suck a raw egg!
Sugar-lips Shapiro! Frightening, ain't it?
You don't want to cry over a dame that doesn't even know you're alive! Snap out of it!
...a Lieutenant James Dunbar?
Wait a minute. We have some rights here.  Why is this man being taken out?
Not yet.
What do you say, Hoffy. We'll hit the air raid trenches and cut out in back of Barracks nine.
Los, los. Dummkopf!
Anybody call?
Says me.
What's it add up to you, Sefton?
You heard that, Sefton?
Two packs of cigarettes say Dunbar never gets out of the compound.
Hurry up on that trap.  What are you trying to do, Sefton? Gum up the works?
You off your rocker?
What are we going to do with him?
Price. When I go I want you to give me five minutes. Exactly five minutes to get Dunbar out of that water tank. Then you throw Price out into the compound, nice and loud. He'll draw every light from every goon tower. It's our only chance to cut through. What do you say, Barracks' Chief?
You could use a new one yourself.
Today's Camp News!  Father Murray announces that due to local regulations the Christmas midnight Mass will be held at seven in the morning!
Three hundred and sixty-fifth Bomb Squadron? Out of Chelveston?
Stop that, will you!  Those idiots! So they sprang Dunbar! So what good is it? He's still in the compound, isn't he? How long can he last? Where can they hide him?
Are we going to stand around here and listen to him until the Germans find out where Dunbar is?
Will you get this guy out of my hair so I can go?
December seventh, forty-one.
We have no radio.
Wie hat er's gemacht?
Du lieber Gott! How do you look? You had a fight?
What's the matter with you? You want to be killed?
Hey, Schulz -- as long as you're going to move somebody in -- how about a couple of those Russian broads?
My grandmother's ear-muffs.
Toh-pak-cha=8A 
But that wasn't so long ago. It couldn't have been more than...
What do you mean?
Fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome. It's something we all have to learn to deal with.
Wait a minute. I thought you've always been afraid it would overload your neural net.
But at the first sign of trouble, I'm going to deactivate it. Agreed?
I don't see a control panel, or an access port.
Sensors show five life signs aboard the station, Captain.
Looks like you're stuck with emotions for a while. How do you feel?
Deck 15, section 21-alpha.
Soran may still be obsessed with getting back. And if he is, he'll do anything to find that doorway again.
This is the Nexus?
Where is he now?
I know exactly where I want to go, and when. Back to that mountaintop on Veridian III, before Soran put out the star. I have to stop him.
I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd like to welcome you all aboard.
Prepare to leave spacedock. Aft thrusters ahead one quarter, port and starboard at station keeping.  Captain Kirk, I'd be honored if you would give the order to get underway.
This clock, I gave this clock to Bones.
Captain of the Enterprise, huh?
I'll find a way to contact the Enterprise. You're going to be all right.
But I do have a theory...
An anti-matter discharge directly ahead=8A it might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away.
Keep her together until I get back.
Kirk here.
Normal is what everyone else is, and what you are not.
Sir, is there anything wrong?
Report.
That's a pretty big margin of error.
Well, with all due respect to your Betazoid senses, I prefer to be alone right now.
It's only natural to feel a heightened sense of tragedy when a child dies.  But it goes deeper than that, doesn't it? I can sense that Rene meant a great deal to you.
The royal...studs?
One of the dead Romulans had a tricorder. We analyzed its sensor logs and found they were scanning for signature particles of a compound called trilithium.
As their cloak begins to engage, their shields will drop.
Status!
Will we get another ship?
Unit two, this is One. The Kobayashi Maru has set sail for the promised land. Acknowledge.
Excelsior closing to 4,000 meters, sir.
What's Grissom up to?... Will they join us, or fire on us...?  Chekov, break radio  silence. Send my compliments to Captain Esteban.
For an instant... A scout class vessel.
Do you wish to advise Starfleet, sir?
Sector two... Indicating desert terrain. Minimal vegetation, temperature thirty-nine point four.
It's snow. Snow in the same sector. Fantastic!
Same sector. Metallic mass.
Negative, on surface... A manufactured object.
There <u>shouldn't</u> be any. Only plant forms were built into the Genesis matrix.
Later. Let's go...
So, like your father, you changed the rules...
I don't understand.
Captain... the logical alternative is obvious... beaming down to the surface is permitted...
Very well. Exercise caution, Lieutenant. This landing is Captain's discretion and I'm the one who's out on a limb.
I'm sure Starfleet would approve, sir.
Eight weeks, sir.  But you don't have eight weeks so I'll do it for ya in two.
Certainly, sir. How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle worker?
As promised, she's all yours, sir. All systems automated and ready. A chimpanzee and two trainees could run her.
What happened...?
Is there <U>anything</U> we can do?!
The Genesis planet is gone.
Excelsior, the great experiment, is adrift in space.
Mr. Sulu, you're on manual.
How is Doctor McCoy, sir?
Welcome aboard, Admiral.
But, we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to Genesis...
Yours...?!
Out of the question! The Council has ordered that no one but the science team goes to Genesis!
Yes... I hear you.  I just had to try.

Commander, Klingon vessel. Stand by to board this ship on my next signal.
No.
But -- why?
Please wait!... Surely he would have found a way! If there was so much at stake -- Spock would have found a way!
Why haven't they finished us?... They outgun me ten to one; they have four hundred in crew to my handful, yet they sit there.
I give two minutes. For you, and your gallant crew.  Take every last man: form a boarding party, armed heavily!
Range: 3000 Kellicams.
Firing range, sir.
1,000 Kellicams, closing!
My Lord, enemy commander wishes a truce to confer.
Commander, these are some of the most famous people in Starfleet! Admiral Kirk, my God!
But dear Lord, are we intelligent enough to -- Suppose, this thing were used where life already exists?
Not anymore! Now you can do both at the same time! According to myth, the earth was created in six days. Watch out: here comes Genesis; we'll do it for you in six minutes --
Are you out of your Vulcan mind? No human can tolerate the radiation loose in there!
Say thank you.
Bull. You're hiding -- hiding behind the rules and regulations --
Shore leave, Admiral.
This is completely improper, Commander Chekov. I have no intention of allowing Reliant or any other unauthorized personnel access to our work or materials.
... taking Genesis away from us...
Wait --
Does that about do it?
David. Please.
All right, let's get on the Comm-pic to Doctor Marcus. Maybe it's something we can transplant.
Are you sure these are the coordinates?
Captain Kirk was your host! You repaid his hospitality by trying to steal his ship and murder him.
Khan, listen to me! Captain Kirk was only doing his duty! You --
I'm Admiral Kirk...
I was wrong about you. And <u>I'm</u> sorry.
What are you looking at?
Careful: Not all at once. <u>The</u> <u>engine room</u>. Lock on target and prepare to fire.
Sir -- our shields are dropping!
At them! At them! FIRE! FIRE! Why can't you?
No!
Tactical!
Yours... is... the superior...
Genesis, what's that?
Scotty -- what's left?
Uhura. Can't you augment?
... No response, sir.
Every young boy's fancy. I seem to remember it myself.  Very well. Mr. Scott, are your engines capable of handling a minor training cruise?
Admiral, I've got to take the mains off the line. The energizer's shaken loose and I can't get in there to fix her -- radiation --
If he hadn't, we'd be space by now.
Spock, this is Kirk. It's two hours. Are you about ready?
Your first training voyage, Mr. Preston?
I believe you'll find everything shipshape, Admiral.
It had the virtue of never having been tried.
So you said at the time. Speaking of which, your prot‚g‚'s first rare -- a trifle emotional --
Hrummm... and where are you off to, now?
Their coil emissions are normal... Wait: their shields are going up. They're locking phasers -- !
Admiral, you can't give him Genesis...
Regula is class "D'. It consists of various remarkable ores. Essentially, a great rock in space.
I think we can guarantee she'll follow us, Mr. Saavik. Remind me to explain to you the concept of human ego.
Estimating nebula penetration in two minutes. Reliant is closing.
... the good of the few...
Captain Spock, if you do not hear from us within <u>one hour</u> your orders are to restore what power you can, take the Enterprise to the nearest Star Base and alert Starfleet command when you are out of jamming range.
Very well.
A no-win situation is a possibility every commander may face. Has that never occurred to you?
How we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life, wouldn't you say?
May I speak, sir?
I failed to resolve the situation.
Indeterminate life signs.
It doesn't make sense. These coordinates are well within Regula -- a plantoid we know to be lifeless and airless.
But the damage report -- we were immobilized...
Regulation 46-A: 'If transmissions are being monitored during battle...'
Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha. All is well.
Stop engines.
Sir, you did it.
Approaching Regula and Space Lab Regula I.
Phaser lock inoperative, sir.
We are clear and free to navigate.
I do not understand the final question...
To Earth. To offer testimony.
Don't tell me fish stories, kiddo. I've known you too long.
No!  No... What did you have in mind...?
I mean <u>him</u>, back at his post, like nothing happened. I don't know if you'd got the whole picture but he isn't exactly working on all thrusters.
Now wait just a damn minute.
It doesn't look all that different.
Jim, you've got to let me go in there! Don't leave him in the hands of Twentieth Century medicine.
Wake up, man, wake up!
Hi... Busy?
You mean I have to die to discuss your insights on death?
Most unusual. An unknown form of energy of great intelligence and power. I find it illogical that its intentions are hostile...
... I don't think he understands...
What's your degree in, dentistry?
What's causing that!?
Can you isolate the wave?
Find it?
Team leader, this is team 2.   Come in, please...
So you were at Berkeley.
Well, for one thing, we simply don't have the money to keep feeding them a couple of tons of shrimp a day!
Ohhh<u>kay</u>. I don't know what this is about, but I want you guys outta here right now or I call the cops.
There's really very little point in my trying to explain.
He's harmless.  Back in the sixties he was part of the Free Speech movement at Berkeley. I think he did too much LDS.
Memory problems, too.
Iowa.
He's just going to hang around the bushes while we eat?
So how did a nice girl like you get to be a cetacean biologist?
How will that be done, exactly?
Flown... And that's the last you'll see of them?
What's that?
Well, why didn't you say so? Why all the coy disguises?
Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this for all the tea in China.
Here... In the park?
Steady, now. We need your help.
You can't. Our next stop is the 23rd Century.
I have no time to argue, Gillian. Or even tell you how much you've meant to us... The <u>frequency</u>.
I belong here.  Suppose by some miracle you do get them through.  Who in the 23rd Century knows anything about Humpback whales?
Hey! -- Where you going?!
Well, I... As they say in your century -- I don't even have your phone number. How will I find you?
Thank you, Admiral.
That leaves us no choice. We must destroy the probe before it destroys Earth.
Ready to engage computer, Admiral.
Earth... But when?... Spock?
If memory serves, there was a dubious flirtation with nuclear fission reactors resulting in toxic side effects. By the beginning of the fusion era, these reactors had been replaced, but at this time, we should be able to find some.
Well, Spock, thanks to your restored memory and a little bit of luck, we are in the streets of San Francisco looking for a pair of humpback whales.  How do you propose to solve this minor problem?
I think we'll find what we're looking for at the Cetacean Institute in Sausalito. Two Humpbacks called George and Gracie.
Oh, the complete works of Jacqueline Susan, the novels of Harold Robbins....
Come on, fellah -- speak up!
Spock...
Status?
Admiral. Full power is restored.
Admiral, may I suggest that Dr. McCoy is correct. We must help Chekov.
10,000 M.S.L., Admiral.
Let's see what she's got, Mr. Sulu.
Admiral, I am receiving whale songs.
Scotty, we have to find some Humpbacks.
Stay with me, sir -- I need more power curve...
Go on ahead... Close the hatch!
Admiral, I'd like to continue my work on the ship until you leave.
And... Here is a deposition I have made. If it is not sufficient, I will return to Earth to testify.
I am well, Admiral.
Genesis was perfectly named: The creation of life not death. It was the Klingons who had first blood while trying to possess its secrets.
Your vessel did destroy U.S.S. Grissom. Your men did kill Kirk's son. Do you deny these events?
Professor Scott, if you'll --
If you'll follow me, Professor --
Doctor Nichols, I might have something to offer <u>you</u>.
Hi.
All right, then this is old stuff to you.
It is kind of you to make this effort.
Yes, of course... Do you have any message for your mother?
You have warp capability?
Will it?
Seeing my home planet from space for the first time...
Right beyond that ridge is where the caves begin... we can hide for days...
Do you really think your mighty Federation would be interested in protecting six hundred people?
Perhaps it would surprise you to know that I have often tried to imagine what it would be like to be a child...
But they are in a constant state of growth. Do you find it difficult to adapt?  A child's specifications are never the same from one moment to the next. I am surprised that you do not... trip over your own feet.
Do machines ever play?
Chase me!
Won't he rust?
To many offlanders, what you have here would be more valuable than gold-pressed latinum.  And I'm afraid it's the reason that someone is trying to take this world away from you.
Tricorder functions are limited due to heavy deposits of kelbonite in these hills...
Incomplete, I might add.
Why would the Federation or the Son'a wish to move the Ba'ku?
You're not going to launch anything until...
We're taking this ship out of here... this mission is over...
On Earth, petroleum once turned petty thugs into world leaders. Warp drive transformed a bunch of Romulan thugs into an empire. We can handle the Son'a, I'm not worried about that...
The concentration in the rings is what makes the whole damned thing work. Don't ask me to explain it. I only know they inject something into the rings that starts a thermolytic reaction. After it's over, the planet will be unlivable for generations.
Our best scientific minds already have. We can't find any other way to do this.
What you're asking me to do... is impossible... the crew is loyal to Ru'afo...
The countdown control has been transferred to the collector...I can't override...
Gallatin! So the righteous Starfleet Captain finally released you. Did you encounter any problems on the surface?
The injector performs perfectly in every simulation...
There is an alternative to an all- out assault. Isolinear tags would allow our transporters to lock on to them.
Admiral Dougherty will not be joining us for diner. Deploy the collector.  Do you have a problem with those orders?
Separate the Starfleet personnel and secure them in the aft cargo hold... see that Picard joins them...
His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions...
If we don't outrun them, the manifolds are going to be the only thing left of this ship.
Will that stop the tear?
The Diplomatic Corps is busy with Dominion negotiations.
... and gorgonzolla cheese.
Worf to Picard...
I've already modified a tricorder with one of his spare actuation servos. Its operational range is only seven meters but it should shut him down...
Sensors are not picking up any ships coming from the surface...
He might be using the planet's rings to mask his approach.
Doctor Crusher asked to talk to you when you returned...
You need a haircut, Commander.
All injector sub-systems are confirmed off-line.
... Population three hundred million...
Counselor?
This isn't one of the usual therapeutic postures...
Why don't you try sitting up?
All hands. Battle stations!
We're fine, sir. It will take some... time to explain.
It's Cochrane.
It's not the radiation... and there's nothing wrong with the combadges... the Enterprise just isn't responding.
Is it Japanese?
The occipital fracture is widening... we're going to have to fuse the bones...
You are the guiding intelligence behind the Borg...?
No... no, it's so... empty... please... give it back... I need it...
Dispersive armor is holding.
The Borg ship has modified its shields, Captain. Our phasers will no longer be effective.
It has entered Earth orbit.  Correction -- it is not in orbit. It is heading directly toward the surface.
Mister Data, I want to know the exact date and time.  Give me a damage report on that missile silo.
But now... they are all one with the Borg.
Who are you?
No. Human beings do not have that luxury, and neither should I.
I have the silo, sir. Bearing three one zero... distance, three hundred meters.
Blast door. It's designed to protect the control room when the missile is launched.
Picard to Enterprise.  Enterprise, please respond.
This used to be the throttle valve assembly.  It controls the thrust of the engines. It's been completely vaporized... and without it, there's no way to launch the ship.
Yeah... if I knew what it looked like. There's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this...
No... the door's too thick.
The nacelles are charged... nuclear warhead standing by. We're ready to ignite the warp drive.
Are we on schedule? The Vulcan ship will be here in less than two hours.
Oh...  yes... ultraviolet protection. Thank you. Mister...?
Jean-Luc Picard.
That was a pretty clever trick you did with the hospital's batteries. How'd you do it?
Invasion.
There is no invasion...
Take care of him. He's a very special man.
No... but sometimes I feel that way.  What I meant was, I'd be willing to trade for the photographs.
Ruby... I need to talk to you about those photographs. It's very important.
We?
You're leaving, aren't you?
I don't care if you're from France or Venus... just take me with you.
Why?
Signal the Endeavor to fall back. We'll cover them.
Port battery, ready sir!
Captain, I've found the Borg Sphere. It's on the far side of the planet...firing at the surface.
Report.
Looks like they damaged the silo...
And if they succeed, humans won't make First Contact with the Vulcans tomorrow.  As First Officer I should be the one beaming down...
What are they doing?
They're re-routing the deflector power conduits...
They're connecting the conduits to subspace communications...
Emergency override!
Someone...?
Worf? Is something wrong?
No response.  I'm not reading any Starfleet com traffic in this entire sector.
Captain, they're firing at a nuclear missile silo... in central Montana.
Are we in any danger of being detected by Earth defense systems?
Mr. President.
I'd prefer not to be the President to push the button if I can avoid it.
Spock, that was actually funny.
Specifically of...?
It's the viridium patch Spock slapped on my back right before we went aboard Gorkon's ship.
Once we're beyond the shield they should be able to pick it up two sectors away.
Perhaps with a few small steps at a time. Like this one.
Too bad we can't SMELL her.
Retire.
Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?
I tried to save him! I was desperate to save him! He was the last best hope in the universe for real peace.
Would you care to go topside?
WHAT HAPPENED?
Under article 184 of Interstellar Law, I place you both under arrest. You are charged with assassinating the Chancellor of the High Council.
What?
Spoken by you?
You deny that your men beamed aboard KRONOS One and shot the Chancellor?
Captain, you're not going to show them the bridge??
Just the size of my head -
Get close enough to a man and you can kill him on "Stun" without setting off the alarm - of course you can't get rid of the body...
This is the first evidence that corroborates our theory.
I've heard of chameloids - "Shapeshifters" - I thought you were mythical.
Your friends are late...
How did you know...?
I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.
Maybe if their particles just got a wee bit mixed...
Stand DOWN, Mr. Scott. All stop. That's an order.
We're almost at the rendezvous - I thought you'd want to know...
I always wanted to try that.
This is Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior.
I'm sorry, Captain - your message is breaking up.
The Conference is at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border. I'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency.
I know your father's the Vulcan Ambassador for heaven's sake, but you know how I feel about this: they're animals.
DON'T TRUST THEM. DON'T BELIEVE THEM -
Lieutenant, I am pleased to see you.  The Lieutenant is the first Vulcan to be graduated at the top of her class as the Academy.
We HAVEN'T fired -
I am responsible for involving you in this. I will go.
I was blind. I couldn't see past the death of my son. I couldn't trust.
Captain, perhaps we're going about this the wrong way; our job is to get to the conference; HER job will be to stop us.
What's she waiting for?
Uhura?
How did you - ?
Suppose when they returned they threw the boots into the garbage?
If you are logical.
But it was when you tried to persuade me the Captain was guilty that I should have understood.
Trouble?
We can send a message to Starfleet Command -
Apparently they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.
And if they're still in place?
- could take weeks, sir.
Can you tell me how you came to be on the planet where we found you?
Can you remember our father?
Why?
I do not understand.
Do you know anything about Shinzon's plans against the Federation?
Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship?
Jean Luc, Whatever you were... Right now you're the man you've made yourself. He's someone else.
The more I studied his DNA the more confusing it got. Finally I could only come to one conclusion... Shinzon was created with temporal RNA sequencing. He was designed so that at a certain point his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly, so he could replace you.
As a result the temporal sequencing was never activated. Remember, he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age. He was engineered to skip thirty years of life. But since the RNA sequencing was never activated, his cellular structure has started to break down. He's dying.
So... To happy endings.
That is because you have a familiarity with them. You can predict specific reactions and behavior and are comfortable in that knowledge.
The choices I made have led me here as well. This is the only home I have ever known. I cannot foresee a reason for leaving.
To new worlds...
Starfleet intelligence was only able to provide a partial account of his military record. We can infer he is relatively young and a capablecommander. He fought seventeen major engagements in the war. All successful. Beyond that, we know nothing.
What do you imagine this is?
Do you think this is a wise course of action?
How can you be sure?
Why am I looking at me?
You have a red shirt.
Well, he seems to have the same internal mechanics as Data but not as much positronic develop- ment.  The neural pathways aren't nearly as sophisticated. I’d say he's a prototype. Something Dr. Soong created before Data .
We have lost structural integrity on decks twelve through seventeen, sections four through ten.
No.
May I have this dance?
Sir, the strongest sense I had was that he's more than urious about you. He very much wants to know you.  The same way you want to know him.
Shinzon's Viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts. I've become a liability... I request to be relieved of my duties.
But how can he? He'll kill you.
I'll always be with you now. Now and forever.
It's very faint but I've isolated it to the third planet in the Kolarin system.
I read six distinct positronic signatures, spread out over a few kilometers on the surface.
What's he doing?
He thinks he knows exactly what I'm going to do.
Deanna, on my mark.
Sir, we're being hailed.
New Praetor?
Enterprise. We are the Reman Warbird Scimitar.
So, human... you've met your better self!
It would take me but an instant to tear that valiant heart from your chest.
No!
Sir, we're being hailed.
He wasn't designed to live a complete, human life span.
Strength in numbers?
Counselor Troi, report to the bridge.
Right now, you’re thinking this all sounds too good to be true?
Romulan ale -- I'm surprised. I can't stand it.
Of course you do. If you had lived my life and experienced the suffering of my people... you’d be sitting where I am now. At least I hope you would.
And you dreamed about what was up there. About...
In time, Jean Luc.
All of this so you could capture me?
Maybe I'll train it to do little tricks for me like your robot does.  Or maybe I’ll snap its ugly head off.
I see an old man, set in his ways, afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a Starfleet regulation to tell him what to do. I see the man I will never be.
I don't know.
I hope you're still alive, Jean Luc.
So they’ve got him up and running.
My God...
Minimal damage to the Scimitar.
Believe it or not, I think the cavalry has arrived.
Are we prepared?
This is a mistake.
How long?
What is it?!! Focus on your job!!
Join us, Commanders.  Now what's the disposition of the fleet?
I thought we discussed patience, Commander.
Benny, there's nothing there.
Gate three. It's boarding now.
Food. Eat. I prepare food. I work as a cook. That's how I make money.
What do you do?
Hey, that sounds interesting. You like it?
What do you think of America?
Well, here we are... You go down that ramp there, you're sure to get a ride.
What was your last stop?
Not necessarily bad! If they knew we were here why didn't they let us know they were coming?
George, we've just confirmed the existence of the live extraterrestrial.
I don't care where you're from you just can't disappear into thin air.
We don't have to do it that way. We can catch him this time.
You can change a directive, George. You've done it before. Listen to me. He's going somewhere in Death Valley. Lathrop Wells was never anything but a bus stop. East is the nuclear site. There are no roads in there. She was teaching him to hitchhike. I'm telling you. We block the four roads into Death Valley and we got him.
Mrs. Haydn...
If I don't speak to Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up.
You've been through quite an ordeal, Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? We'll fly you home.
Is the man who kidnapped you there now?
What?
Steering wheel... gear shift... dashboard...
Minneapolis... Minneapolis...
No gas.
Who are you?
Gas.
Who?
Satisfied? Now get out. Out.
I will see it next time.
Sun...
How many days and nights do you have to go...  ...here?
I won't tell anybody if that's what you're worried about. I promise. You'll keep...
I'd love to have a baby. But I can't...
What is hitchhike?
Will you please do it my way? You'll get into trouble if you don't. If anybody talks to you, tell them... I do not speak English.
Your thumb tells the driver that you want a ride.
What are you doing?
I am not a good singer.
What are you saying?
What?
The cowboys were right. You can make money fast gambling.
I'm sure we could find a country and western station.
Tell the baby about me.
Help me!!
Aghh... I'm supposed to umpire a little league game tomorrow.
Tell him I'm not here.
You get that, Lyman?
They're gonna let some local cop blow him away.
We had a flight of F16's play tag with the spaceship over Michigan for an hour. Then it shot straight up and disappeared.
I don't understand.
Is there a reward in this?
Hey, it's none of my business why you're chasing a retard... You want my opinion, it's the girl. She had to hold the guy's hand all the way to the car like he was a kid.
Eh... the store tells you to call when there's trouble, so they won't get sued... But that shouldn't matter if there's a reward, right?
All the roads into Death Valley are blocked. We'd like to talk to you.
Yeah, that's right.
Okay, let's get you wired up.  I hope this axle grease you got in your hair doesn't screw up the squid receptors.
We have nothing to talk about, Lenny.
Lenny the loser.  Panhandler of stolen dreams.
You said you were going to get her out of this.
He doesn't know what's going on. Leave him alone.
The only time a whore should open her mouth is when she's giving head.
And then she said, 'Since we're going to be spending so much time together--'
Cut it out, Tran.
You have to go.  I mean it.
Let it alone, Lenny.  It'll take care of itself.
Look, baby, I've watched you create yourself out of nothing.  You're like a goddamn cruise missile, targeted on making it.  And you will.
You're crazier than I thought, Lenny.  Coming here... Tran's just in there.
Who did it?
How did it happen?  What was Iris doing riding around with Jeriko wearing a wire?
So finally he gives Iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do.
No.
What kind of things exactly?
You see the look on that preppy puke's face?  Fuckin' pissed in his Topsiders.
I'm telling ya, it's over.  We used it all up--
But at the same time he's sending the signal to her--
That's right.  He wants to share. Needs an audience.  This is one sick puppy.
He's been cooked-off
What stuff?
Jesus.
Give him the tape.  See?  It's fucking brilliant!  The tape for Faith.  I know he'll go for it.  I can set it up.
I sent her to the party.  I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran.
Wait a minute.  Now I'm remembering. I killed Iris too, didn't I?
Picture it... I feel like I gotta share this with somebody.  It's too perfect.
No plan is perfect, Lenny.  Hey, cheer up.  World's gonna end in ten minutes anyway.
So there never was a death squad.
How'd you get the tape?  Why didn't the cops put it in evidence?
Yeah, but how'd it get to you?
I said that?  Look, I'll take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer.
Iris, man.  Pay attention.
I don't know, man, she wouldn't let me see it.  Said I wouldn't want to see it.  She said she was going to give it to you to hold for her. Like insurance or somethin'
Show a little respect, Nero.  The man was an important artist.
Nero.
I don't like disappointments, Nero. And do you know what disappoints me very much?
Greetings, gents.  So let's hear this week's sad story.
Come on, Mace.  This is gonna be a big night.  Can't you feel it?  The energy in the air?  There's money to be made, dreams to sell.
Jeez, you're pathetic.  Okay, I got a pickup at the St. James.  I'll take you there, you can get a cab.
Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.
Hey, careful on the jacket.  This is Armani.  You angry?
I need my case.  It's still in the back.
I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace.  Really.
Blackjack?  I don't understand--
And gives it to you.
She said "If they get me".  They. Which means the whole sex-killer thing is a cover, which means somebody whacked her for a reason.
If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.
Whatup Lenny?
What is it?
Lenny, have you lost it completely?
Goddamnit!!  911 is busy!
I can't believe we had to give them the damn tape.
Tell me.
Uh unh.  I won't do it.
It was a tough call.
He's totally cut off from the outer world.
Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--
Yeah.  Lenny.  I have.
I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity.  I was lost, Mace.  In outer darkness.  Then I busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. When I met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank.  Another lost soul.
What is that?
No.  I haven't noticed because I make my payments.  So, Max Pelcher, how's the P.I. business?
Was this him?
Where's the Nuevo American Diner?
Agent Mackelway.
What does the Manager say?
Show's over, boys. Nobody home.
I have 6 tons.
Look...
You're going to miss it. Pay attention.
What did he look like?
An old junker. Like a reservation car. Blue, side door with brown, you know, primer paint. New Mexico plates. A Ford or ah, yeah, a Ford.
Don't say that. Don't even think that. The next thing we'll be hearing about "Zorro Killer" in the media -- this hasn't gotten out, has it?
Chuck, hello.  This is Agent Kulok. She has a background in medical forensics.
I might point out, Agent Mackelway, the reason we haven't been able to crack those rooms is that you refused to share that information with us -- which is also why you were reassigned.
The cut on your arm -- mind if we remove the bandage?
You feeling okay, Agent Mackelway?
We had every reason to believe he was on that plane. He was supposed to be on the plane. Everything was incinerated, it was two weeks before we reached the crash site. We, the Director and I, decided it was in everyone's best interest to declare Dick Low dead. That way he could exit a hero.
I suspected, but you were the one Low contacted. That's why I brought you back here.
I got a look in Testa's computer. His screen name was "Imelda." Have to give him that, had a sense of humor.
You didn't tell anyone where you were?
Watch out for Dick Low, he's a liar; he has his own world. There was a Junior Agent in Seattle, not unlike you, an Agent who fell under Dick's spell. He'd have done anything for Agent Low. Richard got this Agent to take a suspect to the crime scene, beat him up, force a confession -- all unauthorized, all illegal.  The Agent died that night, killed by the suspect. Richard Low got him killed. Worst of all, we had to hush it up, let the suspect go. The suspect was George Sheldon, the second man Richard killed.
He's got you believing in Zero now too.
Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?
Agent Kulok, that boy, as we speak, is in Hawkins' truck, probably still alive, in a dark refrigerated compartment, shivering in just a T- shirt: put yourself in his mind, freezing, terrified, wanting his mother. Put yourself in his mother's place, desperate, imagining the worst is happening as she pleads, back there at the rest stop, for someone, anyone, to listen to her. This is not hypothetical, this is real. It is happening now and you can do something about it.
You used to be in the Behavioral Science Unit, right?
And who kills in the manner of his victim.
Yes I do.
What about the chat rooms themselves?
Chat jargon for moving from fantasy to real victims: "I went live last month."
He thinks he looks young.
It's a no-no.
Hello?
I met with Richard Low.  These are names of missing persons he has flagged. I'm double-checking every case, but I don't want to be too obvious about it. I marked the ones I'd like you to work on.
What happened?
Unlock these cuffs.
Mack must think Zero has a police band.
Uncuff me. What's wrong with you? Don't you want to save the boy?
Okay, I'll unhook you. No weapon.
Agent Mackelway?
This is Richard Low. Stay on the phone. Do not disconnect. I'm watching you. I will instruct you where to drive.
How's the arm?
What was your weakness, sir?
Of course not. They're possibles. I've checked them against Bureau records, check them against your file. How did you get it?
And who else did I find? Agent Thomas Mackelway, crackerjack FBI techie. I was greatly disappointed when you were re-assigned.
[Reality very risky.]
[Lionheart, what happened?]
[You want to talk, Lionheart, or you want to take this a little more personal?]
Headed there now. The same shift will be on at noon.
"MyDick?"
I don't think you understand.
Deputy Director Koessler doesn't want Zero. All he cares about is Low.
You really should. Life, after all, is really just a series of challenges...
Don't do it, Mike.
You ever go to the Kelbo's? On Pico?
Yeah.
Well, you know, it's tough. A lot of traveling. A lot of hotels... but, you know, it's a dream... and the money's really good. I think I might buy another really expensive imported car after my next gig in Vegas...
I like quiche.
Well, I left someone very special behind.
Oh, God. That's two more than me. Tell me it gets better.
To do what?
Oh, I'm sorry. How'd your folks take it?
No... no... The worst was when I went in for this After-School special and I'm sitting in the waiting room with all these little kids. I see they're all signed in for the same role as me...
Let me just check on my boy.
The poor thing. Six years?
A couple of high rollers like you?
You have to lay it on the table.
You're not allowed to hand me money, sir. You'll have to lay it on the table if you want me to change it.
Can I check my messages? I have a calling card.
You said there are advantages to being single. I want to know what the advantages are.
Well... This is it.
Me too.
Neither is acting. Not if you're serious about it.  Can I have one of these?
Hi. Sorry about that.
Hi.
So I don't call either way.
Unless she comes back first.
I don't think I'm gonna take it.
Sounds more like Aids...
Kinda money, huh?
I can't get over how cute the girls in this city are.
I can't wait till I actually get to touch one of them.
There are so many beautiful women here.
No, I just promised myself I'd give it a try. I gotta get out there sooner or later.
I'm such an asshole.
See, it's all how you look at it. If your life sucks, then mine is God awful. I mean, I moved out here partially because I saw how well you were doing. You got in the union, you got an agent. I thought if you could make it, maybe I could too...
How did you get over it? I mean how long 'til it stopped hurting?
By the way, the guys back home said she put on some weight.
You little bitch!
...which means no one will get there 'til ten.
What's he do?
Big butt... you know, can't fly coach.
You live in such a fantasy world...
...It was six months, and she didn't dump...
But most important, man, I'm sorry about what I said. I was drunk... My adrenaline was going...
Thanks, man.  I've been hating myself for the last two days.
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Hi. This is Nikki. Leaves a message. 
That was Sue. We got two parties tonight. One's for a modeling agency.
I don't know, I don't know -- listen to you. We're gonna have fun tonight. We gotta get you out of that stuffy apartment.
You got it bad, baby. You need Vegas.
Tonight, baby.
I'll pick you up in a half an hour.
I took out three hundred, but I'm only gonna bet with one. I figure if we buy a lot of chips, the pit boss will see and they'll comp us all sorts of shit, then we trade back the chips at the end of the night. You gotta be cool though.
Vegas! You think we'll get there by midnight?
Vegas, baby!
First let's see what happens if we play it cool.
Don't make fun, I think we can get some free shit if we don't fuck around.
Let's go. I'm not paying for a room, and if we don't leave now we'll never make it.
She likes you.
It's just that I've been out of the game so long. Trent, I was with her for six years. That's before AIDS. I'm scared. I don't know how to talk to them, I don't know...
...and then I'm struggling to impress some chick who's not half as classy as my girlfriend, who I'm not even really attracted to...
Nice, baby.
Whatever.
Please, Tee. I have to use the phone. Sorry, man.
Sorry about interrupting...
I don't know. The whole Judy Garland thing kind of turned me on. Does that makes me some kind of fag?
That was different.
Selling scrap metal.
He drives a carriage.
I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something.
I wish the game still had fights so I could bitch-slap Wayne.
You guys are such assholes.
How you guys doing?
Was I money?
Please, don't mess with me right now...
You're not just, like, fucking with me?
So, two days?
It's not like that...
Guys... Guys... I got it under control.
Bitch... You little bitch!
Because he's a bitch.
What a surprise...
Yes she did.
Baby, don't talk that way, baby...
...we're not...
You dick.
...Anaheim...
...Shut up, Sue...
It's on...
It's on.
The bear's got his claws back.
Anything...Anything the Godfather wishes.
The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
Be my friend.
What's the matter, Carlo?
You filthy guinea spoiled brat. Clean it up or I'll kick your head in.
Maybe three, four times.  I always asked Freddie if he wanted another bodyguard, but he said no.  Things have been so smooth the last ten years...
Mostly it gives witnesses an excuse to change their identification when we make them see the light.  Then you take a long vacation and we catch the hell.
You think we'll go for that last place?
Thirty per cent.  In the first year your share would be four million dollars; then it would go up.
I'm sure it's the most generous gift today.
No.  Let the people enjoy him.  You see?  He is a good godson.
What is this nonsense?
When I meet with Tattaglia's people; should I insist that all his drug middle-men be clean?
You mean Tattaglia.
What was this for?
And this?
Have you thought about a wife?  A family?
Yes, but sons who would be professors, scientists, musicians...and grandchildren who could be, who knows, a Governor, a President even, nothing's impossible here in America.
Is that why there are more men on the walls?
We hear.  We were told you were a Pezzonovanta...big shot.
Hey, beautiful girls!
You look wonderful, kid; really wonderful.  That doctor did some job on your face.
Ever seen anything like that before?
Mike!  The party starting!
Tom, you're the Consigliere; you can talk to the Don and advise him.
Is the hospital covered?
We should hear what they have to say.
Yes, even the shooting of your father was business, not personal...
No more stalemate Tom, we got the soldiers, we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it. They know me for what I am, Tom-- and they're scared of me.
Hello Kay.  Your father's inside, doing some business.  He's been asking for you.
Christ, Tom; I needed more time with him.  I really needed him.
You really want to know?
My Father sent Luca Brasi after them.  He tied the two Capone men hand and foot, and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths. Then he took an ax, and chopped one man's feet off...
Then the thighs where they joined the torso.
Then Luca turned to the other man...
I never know when you're telling me the truth.
If he's your brother, why does he have a different name?
Michael...
Can you say it?
Visiting hour ends at eight thirty. I'll just sit with him; I want to show respect.
When will I see you again?
Your sister wants to ask you something.
I'm Michael Corleone--this is my father.  What happened to the detectives who were guarding him?
Go on Mike.
O.K.  How long do you think before I can come back?
What is it?
Do you pledge to guide and protect this child if he is left fatherless? Do you promise to shield him against the wickedness of the world?
Barzini's people chisel my territory and we do nothing about it.  Pretty soon there won't be one place in Brooklyn I can hang my hat.
I'm not asking you for help, Mike. Just take off the handcuffs.
Buy me out?...
You think I scam?
You straightened my brother out?
I think so.  Detective squad?
Is he alive?
You should come and have lunch with us, before you go -- Dickie?
I just woke up. I'm sorry.
We?
What? What?
Hi Tom.
It'll just be for a little while. He can be... he makes me laugh.
You'd say if you mind?
If you're not at my place by 7.00, Tom and I are running off together.
Princeton is like a fog, America's like a fog.  This is Marge Sherwood. Tom -- sorry, what was it?
Who? Oh, Tom, hello, how are you? We thought you'd disappeared. We were going to send out a search party.
I'm intruding.
I can't write and I can't spell. That's the privilege of a first-class education. You're upstairs at the back. I think Ermelinda made the bed up.
She can do that stuff for you. Anyway, just wear some of my things, wear anything you want, most of it's ancient. 
Freddie?
She came to me for help, she needed money, and I didn't help her. I didn't help her. Now she's dead and it's my fault.
...The thousand dollars, of course, was only due in the event that you succeeded in bringing Dickie home. Naturally, I hope the trip has afforded you some pleasure despite the failure of its main objective you need no longer consider yourself obligated to us in any way...
Why?
Then I'll take it as a compliment.
I wanted to tell you my plan.
No, no, it's not a threat, I've explained all of that.
What?
Do you think you can steer this thing?
Of course, he's been very involved in his music, hasn't he? I think his theory is, you know, you have to go into a cocoon before you can become a butterfly.
You should watch that!
Hardly.
I suggest you ask Dickie that yourself. Otello's is on delle Croce, just off the Corso.
Is Mr Greenleaf here?
Pleasure to meet you, Dickie's made a fine catch. I know Emily thinks so.
You were right about the telephones. There are no lines, there's some problem.
The thing with Dickie -- it's like the sun shines on you and it's glorious, then he forgets you and it's very very cold.
Dickie!
How are you? Sorry. Is your book going well?
I think he's planning on staying in Rome for a few days.
Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the next day I'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. You tell me.
Dickie was at the Opera last night.
I don't know. Peter has a concert in Athens next month -- and he's asked if I want to go along, help out. He says goodbye by the way -- he's in rehearsal, otherwise --
What?
How would you know that?
Peter Smith-Kingsley. I've heard about you, of course -- from Marge, and Dickie.
So you found Peter...
What's your secret?
You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's?
But you're going skiing with us Yankees, aren't you?
Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
Dickie, my God!
You know, the whole world thinks you killed Freddie? It's terrible.
Ho assunto io la guida delle indagini in seguito alla negativa valutazione delle disdicevoli circostanze verificatesi con il mio predecessore Roverini che come e noto non e riuscito a impedire il verificarsi della scomparsa del signor Greenleaf, il quale era l'unica persona al momento passibile di incriminazione del reato di omicidio del signor Miles.
We'll be there.
My God.
Peter, I'm really sorry to put you through this. I just couldn't face going to the police by myself when my Italian's so rotten.
Welcome to Venice. This place reeks, doesn't it? Can you smell it? Ugh. Sorry. Not the best way to spend your first day.
Anyway I've got to the bottom of the delay. Finally. We're waiting for someone from Rome.
That's good, isn't it?
I've been backpacking.
Tell him I have a fiancée, Dickie has a fiancée and Freddie Miles probably had a string of them.
He wants to know if you killed Freddie Miles and then killed Dickie Greenleaf?
But you're still tormented, you must be, you've killed somebody...
Tom, are you okay?
Hello. What are you up to?
Plans -- good, plans for tonight or plans for the future?
Was that Meredith?
Didn't look that way -- you know -- from a distance.
Why lie?
Or Tom and Peter even.
What are you talking about -- you're not a nobody! That's the last thing you are.
Senta. We have to ask you to stay in Rome.
Yes, exactly, but his first, his first conclusion was that Signor Miles was killed not later than seven o'clock yesterday evening.
Even her.
A few days ago.
That is Miss Sherwood now. Marge Sherwood.
I'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends.
Well, that's not exactly what the Senator has proposed. You might not want to canvass, but there is plenty more other work we need done: Office work, filing, poster hanging.
Yes?
The DMZ?
Well, I don't go to the Plaza every night.
You must be rich.
I didn't mean that, Travis. Just the part about the contradiction.
Your stereo broke? God, I could hardly stand that. I live on music.
What are you doing?
Alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious,
He's Black, OK?
As I said, he isn't Italian. Besides, I thought they just killed them.
Why don't they leave a pigeon instead of a canary?
No, no, it's alright. I'll have a big Coca-Cola -- without ice -- and a large buttered popcorn, and...  ...some of them chocolate covered malted milk balls... and ju-jukes, a box. They last.
Sure. What do you think? She wanted to get out of the cab. I said "Look, you're in the middle of the fucking bridge..."
You run all over town, don't you, Travis?
Truck drivers bring up Harlem Specials that blow up in your hand. But this guy don't deal no shit. Just quality. If you ever need anything, I can put you in touch.
Where.
Yeah. From the likes of them.
What's your name?
What's your real name?
Why? Who are you?
I don't remember.
Listen...
Who's a killer?
He never killed nobody. He's a Libra.
You a scorpion? That's it. You're a scorpion. I can tell.
What's so important?
What should I do? Call the cops?
God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue.
You're not much with girls, are you?
Well, I'm one of your biggest supporters. I tell everybody that comes in this cab that they should vote for you.
Clean. Real clean.  As clean as my conscience.
Twenty-six.
Some. Here and there.
No, I want long shifts.
Who?
Is it hard to get to be a Secret Service Man?
I kinda thought I might make a good one. I'm very observant.
Here, officer, take me in. I'm clean. I didn't do it. Got a ticket once in Jersey. That's all. Honest, officer.
I saw. $20 fifteen minutes. $30 half hour.
Wha -- ?
So howsit?
Wiz?
Look, ah, we never talked much, you and me...
Real down.
Hey!  Now there's some good news.
Maybe.  Not really.
What do you do for the F.B.I., Goodspeed.
Motor oil?
You referring to your intellect, Goodspeed?  Or another portion of your= anatomy ....
Partners?
God's speed.
This Luke was a pretty good guy, wasn't he?
I believe you.
Did you bring along something to read?
Not exactly light reading, I know. Believe it or not, I've read this since high school, and it got me all the way through law school. Besides, there's something in there that'll help you.  You won't have to get very far, it's near the beginning.
I see you got the telegram.
What.
I do?
You first.
Whoa.
No, you are.  I know exactly what you mean.  It's not that you're missing something.  It's that the other person gives something to you... that you had all the time. You just didn't see it until they came along.
We've done this before, so many times.  The last time was so long ago, but it feels like yesterday.
You know, everyone's so excited about the Bijou re-opening...
Your dancing's very good.
Yes, sir.
Well, that's what I knew then.  Or who I knew, I should say.  You see, I was trying to court Miss Angstrom.  I went to the meeting to impress her.
Doc, with your permission, I want to bring someone in here.  Maybe it'll jar this young man's memory.
Luke, I'm hopping you can help him see the reality of the situation. I'll come to the point.  I want to buy the property, and I'm prepared to offer six-thousand dollars for it.  And that's just for the property, mind you.  If you want, I'll leave it to you and your father to dismantle and liquidate the building for whatever salvage value it has, and you keep those proceeds.  I just want the land.
Nine and-a-half years ago.
Why don't you two get out there and dance?
Well, son, I wish I could've shown you more, but this is all that's left.  Just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago. Nineteen twenty-five, to be exact...
Pete.  You think maybe you've had enough?
'Sides, car's right outside.  I'll be seein' ya, Jer.
And you don't know your name or who you are, that right?
You think he's drunk somewhere?
Peter, their hands are tied.  You see that, don't you?
So, you're saying that it's true. You went to a meeting of a known communist organization.
Not at all.
Kid, you gave them what they wanted.  This committee, it feeds on names.  The more names, the better.  But for some high-profile witnesses, like yourself, any name will do.
They'll come back, you know. They'll all c-c-come back.
What happened?
That you got let go.
He was, but he got sick.  We got a new director today.  Why?
You mean, he was... let go, too?
You hungry, son?
Mr. Appleton, I have reason to believe you're holding something back, and that just rubs me the wrong way.  Sir, are you a communist?
I've been wanting a cigarette for the past twenty minutes, but I couldn't convince myself to stop. This 'tilling of the soil' can get a little compulsive, you know.
That sign.  Do you think I could have the room for a single night?
It's utilitarian, I'll say that for it.
Isn't there?  Maybe there isn't. Maybe there's never anything between Mitch and any girl.
And what had you done?
Then why did she object to you?
Annie, that adds up to a jealous, possessive woman.
Then what are you doing here in Bodega Bay?
He got a call from Dan Fawcett a little while ago. His chickens won't eat, either.
Well, Mom, he's the first to admit it.  He spends half his day in the detention cells at the Hall of Justice.
They haven't harmed anyone.
Why didn't Annie stay for dinner?
Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?
Why are they trying to kill people?
I'm looking for a man named Mitchell Brenner.
And the white house?
The two kids?
I see. How do I get down there?
You see, I wanted to surprise them.
Where would I get a boat?
The little girl's name.
Mrs. Bundy, you don't seem to understand. This young lady says there was an attack on the school.
I didn't even know there were many crows in Bodega Bay this time of year.
Deke, have you got a first aid kit back there?
I had a man trip and fall in the parking lot once, sued me before I could bat an eyelash.
How do you do, Miss Daniels?  Acknowledge a what?
There's nothing wrong with those chickens, Mitch. I'm going to call Fred Brinkmeyer right now.
He sold the feed to me, didn't he?
Tell him about the party.
Mother, get a rope!
We won't be here.
I want to try for San Francisco. There are buildings there. Steel and concrete!
We'll worry about that when we get there.
Do you think Cathy's all right?
I lost my husband four years ago, you know.  It's odd how you depend on someone for strength, and then suddenly all the strength is gone, and you're alone.  I'd love to relax some time. I'd love to be able to sleep.  Do you think Cathy's all right?
Then I don't suppose it'll matter much to anyone but me.
Please don't mess me up with bandages, Mrs. Brenner.
'Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know.  Sure is a peculiar thing.
I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
What's more likely, they got in the room and was just panicked, that's all.
Well, if there's anything else I can do, Mitch...
Well... yes, sir, there are.
I understand completely, sir.
No, of course not.
I think so, sir.  Now then, let me see.
Yes, we call them that too.  Ahhh, here we are, Lovebirds... 
What did you say?
But how... how do you know my name?
When?
I think you're a louse.
That was the damndest thing I ever saw.
Do you practice here?
To bring your sister those birds. You said it was her birthday. Besides, I was coming up anyway.
Just a few... just a day or two... the weekend.
Yes, but...
With... with Annie, of course.
...who didn't much care for propriety or convention or...
...the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth?
You were lying.
Why?
Do you expect me to believe...?
I'd still like to see you.
But not for me.
I have several jobs.
I do different things on different days.
You look a little shaken.
Last night? What do you mean?
It's so damn quiet out there.
I hadn't thought of that.  And then the swifts came.
Melanie, Melanie...
That was Al on the phone. He wants me to meet him out at the Fawcett place. Says some detectives from Santa Rosa'll be there in a little while.  Will you be all right here?
I keep thinking of Annie. 
Do you want to try your father again? 
What time is it?
The power.
Have you got a pencil?
They said the myna bird would be here later this afternoon. If you'd care to come back...
I might be able to have them by tomorrow morning. Would that be all right?
No, the birds didn't attack until the children were outside the school. Crows, I think. I don't know, Daddy. Is there a difference between crows and blackbirds?
They're both perching birds, of course, but of quite different species. The crow is brachyrhynchos. The blackbird is cyanocephalus.
For what purpose?
Doesn't it seem odd that they'd wait all that time to start a... a war against humanity?
Help how? What do you want to do?
That's right, sir, I recall it. A large flock of seagulls got lost in a fog and headed in for the town, where all the lights were.
I'm going out that way, lady. You can follow me.
I haven't finished my drink.
Dr. MacFarlane said I should pay you --
I fear he may have to.
I don't know that I can do that, Mrs. Marsh.
That porter was Gray and the gentleman of consequence who couldn't swallow the shame of it -- who took my last paltry savings to hire Gray --
Listen to me, Fettes, I'm one part befuddled with drink, one part over-heels in love with MacFarlane, and one part fey. You're a lowlander, Fettes, and you have no way of knowing what we Highlanders call the second sight.
He's not home.
You don't went to find him. Your news will keep until I tell him.
You know how we get the specimens we use for dissection?
And that's why you don't want to be a doctor, Fettes?
Dr. MacFarlane -- you remember the lady who came to see you yesterday -- the lady with the little girl?
Every street singer with a cracked voice gives tongue to that one.
I don't know that -- neither do you.  This subject may have been an epileptic -- thrown a fit -- fallen out of bed -- cracked her skull and killed herself -- there is everything explained -- the bruise on her head --
She's unconscious.
See that, Fettes?
Did you think Gray was the only one who could handle a mattock and shovel?  I've had some practice in the art.
Of course -- I don't have friends. That's because I can't walk.  I try to make myself used to it.
Afraid you are not as good a doctor perhaps as you make out to be.
No.
Toddy hates me.
Now that wasn't a friendly thing I heard, Toddy.  Not at all friendly.
You can't build life like you put together blocks, Toddy.
Why should I be afraid of you? What are you holding over me?
Aye, Toddy, there is something in what you say.
I brought you something tonight, MacFarlane -- an interesting specimen -- in very good condition.
This is a gift.
Gray, I must rid myself of you -- you've become a cancer -- a malignant, evil cancer -- rotting my mind.
You're getting old, Gray, and it's a hard life driving a cab through these wet and windy streets of Edinburgh --
But why, Gray? Why?
No digging Joseph. The churchyards are too well guarded. We will "Burke" them,
Was the paralysis immediate?
Any attacks of pain since?
Is her pain sporadic or constant?
How long ago?
Believe me, Madame, if I were only a doctor, I would undertake this operation at once.  But I'm more dominie than doctor -- I've a school to run.
How many innocent people did you leave dead back there?
I was hoping you'd find out.
Where is it? This place?
Wrong. Answer.
The scar. Which of you has it?
I was a friend of your sister's.
Daisy. How did you know?
Are you ok?
This tree. Here's where it happened.
All I knew, she was pulling away. It made me crazy.
It's ok, it's ok...
Do you believe in ghosts, Nathan? Because there's a ghost threatening us.
What were you yelling about?
What is it?
What? What is it?
Honey. It's doesn't mean anything. It's not a message.
I think I dropped an earring.
The whole city has stopped. People are running around like ants!
Good. Did you speak to our friend Mr. Carpenter?
As though unsure of what he's heard) Yes -- yes, I have.
You'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting?
Would such, a demonstration be possible before the meeting?
Maybe a little demonstration.
Can I help you look for the space man? Can I?  I know what he looks like! He's got a square head -- and, three great big eyes!
Oh, boy -- can I, Mom?
Well -- Professor Barnhardt, I guess. He's the greatest scientist in the world.
Go to the movies.
Gee -- those look like diamonds!
All you have to remember is, first find the common denominator -- then subtract.
I don't believe it.
How does he explain that?
Naturally we're very curious to know where it is you come from.
The present situation?
Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President--
I -- I'm not sure I understand--
I'm afraid that would be a little awkward. It's -- it's completely without precedent. And there are practical considerations -- the time involved -- the enormous distances.
Good afternoon.  I'm glad to see you up and around.
Our problems are very complex, Mr. Klaatu. You mustn't judge us too harshly.
He's not there.  But look what I found in his room
Tom -- I've been trying to get you all afternoon--
You'll feel different when you see my picture in the papers.
You wait and see. You're going to marry a big hero!
I don't know how to thank you.
He's a fine boy, Mrs. Benson.
I -- I was Just going to lunch.
I saw Bobby this morning before he went to school--
I want to know what he told you last night.
It's only a few blocks to Barnhardt's.
Hello.
No -- that is a power reserved to the Almighty Spirit.
How dare you write on that blackboard!  Do you realize the Professor has been working on that problem for weeks?
That's what I wanted you to tell me.
No -- no, thanks.
Well, how do I know who you are?
I don't like horror comics.
They wouldn't be out in the daytime.
<u>I'll</u> have to drive!
We've been aware of some very serious vampire activity in this town for a long time.
Did you see that sucker burn?!
We still going?
We were gonna grab some food.
So how do you like those maggots, Michael?
Where's Star, David?!
What is this, David?
Where you going?
And these Archies should be over here with the Richie Rich's.
This is just our cover.  We're dedicated to a higher purpose.
Bad breath?  Long fingernails?
What's that smell!?
We don't have one yet.  And we only have two and a half hours to come up with one.
David.
Lucy, you're the only woman I ever knew didn't improve her situation by getting divorced.
Max?  You men we're having company again?
... And stay outta here.
Thanks, Grandpa...
Grandpa, stop doin' the Indian Walk!
Hi... I'm Laddie.
I had the dream again about <u>them</u>.
It was a dream, Star.
You like Michael.
See you later.
Michael, are you still in bed?
Max is coming for dinner, Michael. I'd like you to meet him.
We're getting close...
Ocean air!
What did you say?
Not funny, Sam!
-- a job.
You're cute, Max.
Yeah.  Runaways, mostly.  They come from all over.  Attracted by the boardwalk and the ocean.  Lucy... listen I know I have no right to ask you this... but don't look for another job just yet... I mean besides being the best employee I have... I think you're cute.
I'm really sorry, Max.
Will somebody please tell me what this is all about!?
Are you hungry?  Wanna get something to eat?
Let's go see them.
David's looking for me... I have to go.
Where are we going?
What did <u>you</u> do last night?  You look wasted.
Lose the earring, Michael.  It's not happening.  It's just not happening.
Michael?
What happened, Michael!?
What did you to do him, Michael? Why did he bite you?
Pretty nasty out, Mac.  Thirty-five knots.
Clark, did you notice anything strange about that dog?  Just anything at all?  Any little thing?
... It could have gotten to somebody...
Don't you understand?!  That Thing didn't want to become a dog...
Now why'd you go and...
What?
Auxiliary light cables...?  Been cut.
Could have been anytime.  Anywhere.
Let's open it.
I suppose... well, it's possible someone might have lifted it from me.  But...
Lighten your load, sucker.  You ain't the judge and executioner around here!
Childs!  That a fuse?
Torch it over there!
Well, who says I want you going with me?!
You ain't tying me up.
Spaceship of some kind.
Neither will we.
Maybe we shouldn't make it.
What are you doing?
Would that test have worked?
... Guys as crazy as that could have done a lot of damage to their own before they got to us.
How long will it take you to prepare this?
After all this mess then.
'Bout eighty kilos southwest.
We're a thousand miles from anybody else, man.  It's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better.
Put that down!
Let's rush him.  He's not going to blow us all up.
Looks good.
How's that Thing get to the dogs?  I though we stopped it in time.
Where were the flashlights?
What if it doesn't come?
That thing's too smart to be hiding any more of its clothes, MacReady.
We're going to draw a little bit of everybody's blood.
Where was he trying to go?
Get your gear on.
Magnesium of some type... or some kind of strange alloy.  And those poor dumb bastards had to go and blow the hell out of it.
He's one of them.
You hear that?
It's in between us and them!!  How we going to get back?!
... Well, you wanted to see it.
Yes.  Just about here.
I must say, you look remarkably good.  You don't want a book then?
Please, we need your help.  The Morlocks have taken --
Do you know where they live?
Because you'll never die.
Aren't you a plucky little -- ?
Machines?
Why did they built it?
Takes a licking but keeps on ticking...  ... For a while anyway.
Well, Alexander, as a fellow scientist I know you have a thousand questions --
No, we created the Morlocks.
You wouldn't understand.  We genetically engineered the Morlock class to serve our needs.
And centuries later when we tried to emerge into the sun again, we couldn't.  Our adaptation was too successful.  We survived... we endured... for this.
No... they didn't survive only to be your food.  You did that.
You took her because she helped me.
She won't remember you.  None of them will.  You will be forgotten. That is how history works.
How do you keep the water temperature stable?
Dance with me...
Alex... people are staring.
Let them.
I was not.
Damned if I can keep her out of my equations.
Alex, really... good luck tonight. She's a fine girl, and she's done wonderful things for you.
All these clocks -- how can you constantly be running late?!
I've been working.
It's my Jamie's birthday today. Your godson.  He's nine years old. At his party he asked me if Uncle Alex was coming.  I told him no. Then he asked me if you didn't like him anymore.
I know that --
You won't say that in a week.
Did you hear me, lad?
Yes.
His curiosity is amazing.
We don't have anything like this. Or the machine where Kalen found you.  And I doubt they do beyond the valley... Now where do you come from?
Oh, that explains everything.
That machine --
You seem fascinated by the stars.
Mara, I had a strange dream last night.  I was here, walking through a forest very much like this, and then...
Yes!
The mud carriers.
It has no purpose.  It's just beautiful... Does everything have a purpose where you come from?
Alexander...?
You've welcomed me into your home. Into your lives.  Everyone has... For the first time in a long time it doesn't hurt quite so much.  I thank you for that.
Yes... a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship- shape.
Oh, I'm already swooning.
Sir, Mr. Philby is here.
But I know that none of my faculty would ever deviate from the assigned curriculum.
Sir, that curriculum is forty years out of date.  The students today are looking toward the new century -- they want to be challenged and inspired, not spoon-fed dusty old equations that have been proved a thousand times.  They want to explore.
No, sir --
With respect, sir, would we have the telegraph without fantasy? Would we have radium and X-rays without someone first dreaming we could?
And hungry, I'd say.  You had such a long journey.
My father has gone to a better place.
Good morning, Alexander.  Feeling up to some work?
We have to go after them, find where -- !
What did you do at night?
I want to see your home.  Will you take me?
Should we be...
I didn't dream it. I may have been asleep but it wasn't a dream. BECKER sits down in a CHAIR, half-shrouded in the light.
I'll say a prayer for you in Church today, Starks. Maybe the Gods can pick up where the medicine left off.
No. I didn't. I swear I didn't. I probably helped push you to kill yourself, but I didn't do it.
That's right! Goddamn, you're the spitting image. I didn't know he had a son.
What should they be looking for?
You look like you've lost some weight. Are you eating?
I need to get this letter to someone.
And I can't stay here in my condition. I am going to die tonight. It's already been decided.
But I like it I guess.
What're those?
Stop it! Stop it! JACKIE covers her ears and looks at him, pleading with her eyes. STARKS' eyes plead right back.
You can't be William Starks. He's dead.
I looked it up.
I gave you my dog tags.
How long do we have?
What about Captain Medley? He never told them what happened to you over there. His testimony...that coward wanted them to think you were crazy.
What's happening to me? Why am I getting so much weaker?
What?
Because Becker resigned after the charges brought against him by State Patient Advocacy Groups.
And if I didn't want to come?
So maybe Dr. Becker would know. [Beat] But, as I'm sure you know, the statute of limitations has run out for charging the hospital with any liabilities.
What about the world?
[Beat] Like who? Like MacKenzie maybe?
And how do you know that?
I know. I know it all. Save your strength. I already know everything you're going to say. [Beat] You're in the Jacket right now, aren't you?
Can I get some paper and something to write with.
I'm not gonna let that happen.
Yeah, well 30 times probably would make you seem crazy.
I know you need one when it's really cold.
Oh no, you're pretty young. Your body'll be able to handle a lot more of it than you think...
If you're deaf, read my lips...I don't need a psycho following me today.
Well, where are you from?
Of course you don't know.
[Beat] Yeah, I'm fine.
What's this?
This is a great song.
Honey?
On what?
He said he took it to a motel in Oklahoma City.  He also says that at that time he met a man.  He identified you through a series of mug shots.  He also told us that you and Mrs. Dickinson seemed "close." Is that true?
Did either of them ever indicate that they might be running from the Law?
Well, you're not exactly an expert witness, but what makes you so sure?
All we know is there were two women in a green T-Bird convertible that turned left out of the parking lot, going real fast.  We're trying to get a make on the car, but nothin' yet.  So far, we got nothin'.
That's certainly possible.
This is serious, son.  A man is dead.
Armed robber.
What kind of gun was it?
We're going to leave someone here at the house in the event that she calls in.  Someone will be here until we find them.
Good God.
Stop.
Don't hurt me.  Harlan.  Please.
This is J.D.  He's a student.  We're just givin' him a ride to... to here.  Louise said we could bring him here and then he'd have to go. And that's what he's doin'.  He's goin'.  Aren't you, J.D.?
What?!  Parole officer?  You mean you're a criminal?
I've always believed if done right, armed robbery doesn't have to be a totally unpleasant experience.
You're kinda the best thing that's happened to me in a long time.
Good answer.  Same goes double for me.
I have a savings account with about sixty-seven hundred dollars in it. Now I know you won't be able to get it out, but I'm good for it.  I need that money.  Can you wire me the sixty-seven hundred dollars and I'll pay you back?  Please, I'm desperate.
Something real bad has happened and I can't tell you what, just that it's bad and I did it and I can't undo it.  Can you help me?
Louise, let me call you back after I wire it, so you'll know which office to go to.
What?
Hello...
Now, my little coconut, what seems to be the trouble here?  Tell Daddy everything.
So whaddya think.  I mean... I could... uh... get a job.  Of some kind.  I mean you've been tellin' me that for years, right?
I'm the one... I never made it work. I just... It's not that I don't love you.  It's not that.  I just never thought I'd be thirty-six years old and I never thought... I don't know what I thought.  What do you want, darlin'.  What do you want me to do.
You wanna take it out of your wallet, please?
Front.
You're kiddin'!  Alright!  I'll be there around two or three.
I don't know.  Warm stuff, I guess. It's the mountains.  I guess it gets cold at night.  I'm just gonna bring everything.
Whose place is this again?
Thelma!
I just haven't seen you like this in a while.  I'm used to seeing you more sedate.
Alright...  I changed my mind.  I'll have a margarita with and a shot of Cuervo on the side, please.
Jeez, Louise, that wasn't very nice.
So, Jimmy still hasn't called yet?
Exactly.
Shit!  I... I, which way?
We have to think this through.  We have to be smart.  Now is not the time to panic.  If we panic now, we're done for.  Nobody saw it. Nobody knows it was us.  We're still okay.  Now all we have to do is just figure out our next move.
It means shut up, Thelma.
You're not touchin' that car.
Did you finish thinking?
You talked to him?!  Is he mad?  Did you tell him?
But you think he fools around.
I... I don't know.  I don't know what you're askin' me.
Louise, this young man is on his way back to school and needs a ride, and I thought since...
Well, it looks like we can get on this road 81 that heads down towards Dallas, then cut over to...
I'm sorry.  Well, we need the money. Now we have it.
To find out if he knows anything. If you think he does, you gotta hang up because it means the police have told him and the phone is probably tapped.
But it wasn't!  We got away!  We were walkin' away!
That J.D. kid is a little shit.
How'd they find out we're going to Mexico, Thelma, how they know that?
Just stop talkin' to people, Thelma! Stop bein' so open!  We're fugitives now.  Let's behave that way!
Oh yeah.  You mean Peek-a-poos.
This is so beautiful.
Look!  Look who it is, Thelma.  I'll be darned.  What's he doin' way out here.
Well, I figure if you take a state policeman, shoot up his car, take his gun and lock him in the trunk, it's best to just get on out of the state if you can.
I don't want to see any more beef jerky.  I mean the next beef jerky you hand me is going out the window. It's drivin' me crazy.  The whole car smells like it.
And I don't want any more Wild Turkey, either.  It's burning a hole in my stomach.
He said they're charging us with murder.
We'll be drinkin' margaritas by the sea, Mamasita.
Yes!  Yes!  Now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that?
We've gone insane.
I guess we shoulda made some kinda plan for what to do if we get caught.
What?!  What d'you think?!
You're a good friend.
God!  It looks like the Army!
Then let's not get caught.
I'm not apologizing for shit!
Well, uh, can you tell us his name?
This wasn't your first time, was it, Ted? How many we talking?
Stop it!
It must be great with a wife like that.
Mary again.
Whatever happened to Mary?
So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up?
You're kidding? What did they say?
What's that, Dom? What's the bright side?
What's so funny?
No You mean...?
Shoot.
Fuck me.  Let's go home.
Oh God, I'm fucking nervous. I don't know if I'm ready for this, man.
Check.
Think about it: After you've had sex with a girl and the two of you are laying in bed, are you nervous?
Wrong. It's because you ain't got the baby batter in your brain any more. That'll fuck with your head, that stuff will.
Bob, do you remember Mary?
I got twenty bucks says you're full of shit.
This is a good one, Mare. Sounds like his partner's all lubed up.
You should thank me -- that girl was not easy to find. What'd she scam you out of-some insurance dough?
I'm worried about you, man. You better learn to have a pop once in a while or you're gonna fall off the wagon. You're being a fanatic and that ain't healthy.
Jesus, you know what? This shit doesn't even taste good to me anymore.
The sawbones?
Oh yeah.
Yeah, don't talk in someone's backswing.
Here. Spend it on your trip to Katmandu.
What are you doing with all these blueprints?
I'm kidding. Yeah, I guess you could call me an architect -- it's just a job really, a way to keep me moving. My real passion is my hobby.
You know...  ...the guys who ride the short bus.
-- There's this one kid, we call him Mongo on account of he's a mongoloid. He got out of his cage once and --
Yeah, it's fun for them, but it's heaven for me.  Those goofy bastards are just about the best thing I have in this crazy old world.  Ooh, hey, I gotta run.
Oh, Pufferball likes his little tum- tum rubbed, doesn't he now?
I know he's around here someplace.
Try to be. It's tough going with the crap they make today. If Dumb and Dumber's the best they've got to offer I say thanks but no thanks.
Yeah.
No, forget it, it was stupid.
Fuck!!
Urrggghh...
Are you okay?
You want her dead, don't you?
I get one hundred a day plus expenses.
I've got some very, very good news for you, my friend.
I think your life's about to change.
Nope. Never been.
Thanks, Healy. Good work.
Look, uh, I've been thinking about everything you told me.
Well I think you're right, I should look her up.
Yeah well fuck you! You just can't stand the fact that it was my turn.
Are you telling me you didn't send Mary a letter outlining our deal?
Among others.
Well, I'll tell her I ran into you.
Do you know the... soccer stadium?
You know, I really should take your card.
You what?
I'm a phony -- just like you, man.
I mean I'm a fucking fraud. I'm no architect. Don't be a putz -- who's been to Santiago twice in a year?  Estadio Olimpico -- please!
Yeah, Steve. Steve was all right for awhile.
I don't know, it was complicated. He's in San Francisco, I'm in Miami.  Besides, Magda's psychic dog hated him.
You picked that up on the scanner. We gotta move.
So who's the lucky guy?
Sure.  Uh, Magda, why don't you get some more cheese and crackers...?
I'm buying bananas tonight.
Don't bet on it. Last time I had a pap smear the guy needed leather gloves and an oyster shucker.
Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're in love doesn't mean everyone else has to be.
Holy shit...
Magda!
Oh, hi hon. Just straightening up.
You don't think they're too big?
What's up?
I can't believe this is happening. I'm supposed to be meeting him in an hour.
Name's Norm. I live up in Pompano with my folks.
Hey, you're limping. Did you just hurt yourself?
Oh he can hold you. He weighs two- hundred-and-thirty pounds.
The prom -- you going?
By the way, how's he doing?
Oh. So... what brings you down here?
Nope, haven't walked the plank yet.  There was this guy back in college who was bothering me... got kind of ugly -- a restraining order, the whole bit. Anyway, when I got out of Princeton I changed my name as a precaution.
What's that?
Okay, sometimes I'm a nineteen.
It's too bad you don't live down here, Ted.
Well good for you. I bet it works out for you.
Ted... you're not that far ahead.
Yeah? What do you want?
Jesus Christ, guy, what the hell were you doing?!
I, uh... I got it stuck.
Just relax, dear. Now, um... what exactly are we looking at here?
Hey.
Piggyback ride.
See you, Warren.
I believe the President made it clear that there would be no firing on ships without his express permission.
Good.
There's still no sign they know that we know about the missiles. Been a lot of cloud cover; probably think we aren't getting any good product.
Well, I'm not.
He gets it, but he's pissed.
The other thing is...
Where've you been? We've been trying to find you all morning.
All right, so maybe we overestimated how reasonable this trade would look. Okay? You happy? So now what?
We gave so much to get here. I don't know. Sometimes I think what the hell did we do it for?
Yeah?
Hey, Mac. You're up bright and early.
You gotta stop 'em. We know it's Jack and Bobby's idea -- they leaked it to Lippman. The military guys are going ape, and they're not alone.
Is this the Chiefs' recommendation?
What happens to you? I'm not leaving without you.
If you're home it means either Jack and Bobby have finally figured out what a con man you are and fired you, or --
It's Tuesday. You said to call. When do I get my 45 minutes?
Secretary of Defense...
I was eating that.
Call me Irish, but I don't believe in cooler heads prevailing.
I'm not calling and canceling on Daly. You call and cancel on Daly.
How does a man get to a place where he can say, 'throw those lives away,' so easily?
That's going to be tough. You know how these guys are about their chains of command...
He's right, we can't rescind DEFCON 2. The Soviets will think we've gotten sweet on them.
It's a goddman trial balloon. Trial is the operative word, here.
They know each other! Khruschev and Feklisov aka Fomin were war buddies!
At least it will expose whether Khruschev has been overthrown. We'll know what we're dealing with.
That may be why Khruschev's introducing this guy. We've been burned by his usual players in the formal channels, so he brings in an honest broker.
Captain, belay that order!  Bob, where's that coming from!
Anyone stops us going in, we're with the Bowen-Hamilton Textile Company. We have rug samples.
You know how in your big cities, you got your niggers and you got your Puerto Ricans? Well out here we got Indians. That's just the way it is.
What are you doing?
Interesting bloodline you have, Ray.  French, Scots-Irish, Italian, ...and one-eighth American Indian.
South Dakota...  Did I do something unsatisfactory, Sir?
Hey, hey, hey. J. Edgar would've loved you. He'd love anybody who joined the bureau to, what was it? "To enforce the laws of my country and protect her interests"?
Somebody was serious about doing this guy, that's for sure.
Leo has to take the journey, Cooch.
Leo's gonna need his hands, Cooch. He does quillwork.
Water. Worth killing for out here, I'd think.
They obviously wanted it to be known that they offed Leo. Some kind of statement.
Her oil pan is shot.
The right man? Talk to me, Ray.
Today. And now you -- there's a dog in the van --
I'll sleep around a little.
Bastards...
It may have been Maggie's way of saying "get off my ass."
Eagle's claws and a bear's balls that's what her profile says.
Tread matches. It's the car.
And it was full of water when I drove by here three days ago. Full. I mean... a river.
Never turn your radio off! I thought I was gonna find you scalped! Damn it!
Come on, Ray. Come forward.
Ray...
No. Not just a track. You gotta listen to the trees, man. To the leaves. To this sand, you FBI's kicked all up. You gotta listen to the earth.
What did he say?
What's he smoke in that?
So did this one. Wambli is a rare and sacred creature. When someone finds a dead one, the feathers get around the res. We share everything. A lot of power in the eagle feathers. But you think that's bullshit too, don't --
The old man? He's gonna tell you who killed Leo?
I can't do that,  It's a Rolex.
It's not real.
You think you was sent here cuz you're a good cop?
You got Jimmy. Let her go.
Why? So you can get rid of me, too?
I'm a full-blood Oglala.
Maybe it was just a dream. Ya know, just one of them, what do ya call 'em, fitful dreams?
Alright. Shit's comin' down. He's callin' council fire. All the old chiefs and the warriors, too. I gotta be at Grandpa's place in two hours. We need to get the tribe together. We need to block this thing.
I thought it was a rare case of a brother getting a break in the courts. We did an honorin' song for him and everything.
He's gone.
They got us sealed. What are we gonna do?
I'll have to see what the visions say about that one.
You take care.
I desecrated it?
What?
I have a pick-up truck. No plates. Subject -- Indian -- entering suspect's house. Over.
X21. Come back.
I'm not that sure. Yeah, I think --
They said I'd never see FBI again, and I'm livin' with you fuckers. I don't feed ya information on the Warriors, it's back to the pen. I don't do this, back to the pen. Your word against my word. Against a con Indian's word. I really got a chance, man, right?
What's Tashka Sha, speak English, speak English!
Yeah, most likely.
I beg your pardon.
You saw a MiG 21?
Yes, ma'am.
You seemed determined to do that anyway.. Why didn't you tell me you were a famous MiG insulter? MAVERICK Would it have made a difference?
What would?
Some one comes up hot on your six, what do you do?
And probably never again. It's nothing personal. It's just...I know a lot of pilots. Maybe I'm immune...
Anything.
It dies. We live.
No!
Does it bother you?
You're totally insane.
...they say you're alright.
That's what you get flight pay for.
Where are we?
I'm not good company. I should be alone.
No.
You're crazy.  That's a pretty silly game.
You say the truth.  Go ahead. Don't be afraid. You want to win the game, don'tcha?
You didn't mean it. You didn't think. You'd do anything to take it back.
Well?
Tomcats?
Can't shake him.
I've got a six strobe.  I think he's locked on us.
Hey, if it was easy, everybody would want to come up here and do it..... Instead of just us.
Help me with this one, I'm really screwed up.
Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong!
Can't you feel it? I'm hanging in my straps!
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT DOESN'T GET TO LOOK MUCH BETTER THAN THAT?
Don't WORRY!!!?   You've GOT it!!? Are you CRAZY?
5000 feet. Speed two hundred.
Is it you?
You're not supposed to...
What do you want?
Well, it doesn't just happen, you gotta do something famous.
So I've heard.
Tom Kazansky.
How was it?
Nice. Always a good idea to show up your instructors. He nods toward Jester, glaring at them from his A4. Goose indicates the backseat of the Tomcat.
You ever done this before?
Hey Mav, this is Sally. She doesn't believe a word I say. Tell her I'm married, will you?
Great move. Great
It's a victory roll.
Come on, come on! It's double or nothing.. We're talking twelve bucks American, here.
Relationships are a bitch, here. It's hard enough to concentrate ...under the pressure. Having a woman here is asking for it.
No, we...got our butts kicked.
IF YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN.
I guess I owe you one.
Figured it out yet?
Who is the best.
Need a hint?
He's seat of the pants... Completely unpredictable -- nothing by the book. All over the sky. But I don't know, Skip, he's really got something.
Who's the hell is that?
You won?!!!
That is all. Tell me about the MiG some other time...
Goose is dead.
I called your house.
We can send you back to your squadron with nothing noted on your record except "CNC" --course not completed, no explanation required. Theoretically, it doesn't hurt your career, but people always wonder about things like that.
Where's yours?
What happened to number five?
How could you do this?  You're a mutant.
Never mind.  Wet a towel and wrap it around your head.  That'll muffle the signal.
Hmm.  It seems you left something in our safe.
Richter, do you know why I'm such a happy person?
But I thought...
Oh shit....Oh shit...
Demure, aggressive, sleazy?  Be honest.
What do you want?
He's not at ground level.
Let me go!
...You mean it?
Let's do it.
Well...What do you say?
You are somebody.  You're the man I love.
Our friends, my job, eight years together, I suppose all this was implanted too?
Clever girl.
Now help me out here, Doug.  You were interested in a memory of...
To be perfectly honest with you, Doug, if outer space is your thing, I think you'd be much happier  with one of our Saturn cruises.Everybody raves about 'em.
As real as any memory in your head.
All right.
No options.
...What?
Hauser, you're lost your mind.
This is too weird.
Don't be ridiculous.
I said get out!
By the way...ever heard of a company names Rekall?
Where are you going?!
Where's this "reactor" come from?
You sure about this?
What's wrong?
Okay, Burt, listen.  Forget shooting them.  Tell me this: can you get to your truck?
What?  Well, for chrissake, we could have made a stand at our place!  We had food, water...
What do <u>you</u> use it for?
Miguel, the trouble's come to us. If we're not ready...
I can't believe it.  No tracks, no sign, no spoor.
You're not getting any penetration, even with the elephant gun.
A beauty, isn't it?  We bought three of them for the rec room.
What the hell you doing back already?
She's got my vote.
You know, up the jeep trail.
Oh my God.
Nothing.  But it sure might be a nice way of getting to know her.
Well, I'm a victim of circumstance.
Well, <u>you're</u> the one won't work in the car wash.  You're the one's gotta have a plan.
Probably up a pole starving itself to death.
Fuck you!
It must've grabbed us.  That's why the truck stalled-out.
That means we're gonna be out here, like, in the dark.
Here's the plan...We don't <u>even</u> stop.  Ride like hell.  Tonight we keep right on going.  We'll walk the horses.
Well...haven't seen a sign for hours.  Maybe it's long gone.
Well, folks, what's the plan?
Get real.  I'm faster than you.
Watch your ass, shithead.
Well...that's it.  We're not getting off this rock...
Christ, Val, maybe she's not your type, but you could, at least, be civil.
Val, we're going to have to forget about the truck...
You sure this is where it was?
Come on.  Get away from it!
Well, I'm supposed monitor these seismographs.  You know, they measure vibrations...
Rhonda's got an idea about that.
Look, the situation hasn't changed. We still have to get to solid rock. There must be <u>some</u> way!
I think the ground's getting closer.  I think we do it.  We're gonna save our asses here!
Objection, your Honor! The fact that the witness is currently a patient is immaterial!
Your Honor, that's not fair -- !
Good morning, Mr. Dowd. Do you think you might be up to cross-examining Mr. Ortega this morning?
What, "everything"? You shot a corpse. I don't give a shit about that -- !
No it's not the only issue. There's another issue, for the jury. What about entrapment?
Exactly what information led you to arrest my client just two-and-a-half hours after the shooting took place?
-- an angel dust dealer --
Where?
Kim got busted at 19 for burglary. At 20 he was convicted in the shooting death of a young Chinese gang lord... The prosecution claimed Kim did it to get into "the Joe Boys"?
What other case?
-- Easy as that, huh?
-- Listen: "November 5, 1980. Cecil Stipe walked into 5th Precinct. Says he witnessed Chin shooting, saw suspect's picture in Post. Says Shu Kai Kim wrong man."
Do you have to do that?
Shoulda told the one about Shu being the bastard child of Mother Theresa.
Uh, Eddie? The, um, ballistics guy, George...? He called, and...  His tests show that Shu's gun fired the bullet that killed Jimmy Chin.
Eddie -- it's Art Esparza!
-- What?
They could've been brothers. It's why the eyewitnesses picked Shu.
How long did it take Badalato to drive Jimmy Chin's body from Chinatown to the morgue?
Pardon... Which dialect do you speak?
Just which Constitutional amendment protects our right to peddle PCP?
I embellished.
So there goes your theory about the Joes giving up Shu to protect their trigger man.
I haven't thanked you for your work, Kitty. You're doing good work.
You do.
I killed the motherfucker.
-- About what?
You can't. So tell me what you do know -- say it!
-- How could I help you?
I did two tours in 'Nam...
I'd l-like to answer the question.
Yes, but that's not the issue. What's on your wish list, Ed? Pleading Kim out to first degree man on both homicides, with an agreed sentence of 15 to life running concurrent? Come on... What're you looking for here?
You're pissing me off again, Ed.
I'll prosecute anyone who fucks up. If that makes me look racist, it's a trade-off I'll live with, Ed.
Your Honor, that's trial by ambush!
I can't be expected to remember the name of every informant eight years after the fact.
You read Eddie's Chase Manhattan Bombing summation in the Leftist Law anthology?
What do you want?
A Cubano army, basically... inside and outside prisons.
Do the rival gangs compete for control of the prison drug trade?
"Name, rank and serial," Mr. Ortega. Let's not hide behind the Fifth.
I think what Eddie wants to say is --
Cooper, the ooze of mumbo jumbo is rising up above our heads. Do you honestly think Cole's practice of word association works?
What color hair will she have?
Thank you, Bobby. A big score?
Here he comes.
Babe, I'm on my way out to the woods to divvy up the product. Put this cash in your safety deposit box...  It's ten thousand dollars.
The stuff we got last night.
Bobby's got it.
GOD. I'm beginning to lose faith in the United States Government and that includes the telephone system. Don't you folks talk to one another. That's her trailer there and I haven't touched a god damn thing. Agent Chet Desmond come by a second time and asked too see Deputy Cliff Howard's trailer  ...which I showed him. I went back to my trailer...  After that I never saw him again.
Mrs. Simmons owns the trailer and she lives in town. Teresa rented it about a month ago.
Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
You try that you little monkey.
OK, Gordon.
What is it, Gordon?
I cracked the Whiteman case with this.
Where is the ring?
Where am I? And how can I leave?
Maybe, later we could take a look.
Accidental?
I doubt it was drugs, more likely a problem with a nerve. I could recheck the arm for injuries, but for real nerve work we are going to have to take the body back to Portland.
My guess is there isn't enough detail in the photo to get an idea of the design on the ring, but we should do a blowup of this anyway.
One thing that has been troubling me. That lamp at the diner. Do you think they were working on it for esthetic reasons or was their work due to faulty wiring?
If I am going to get through math today, you're going to have to bring me up to speed quick.
You know what your problem is?  You're just too adorable...
You're telling me, but only because you never let me in on any of it... you're not going to see Bobby, are you?
Maybe I better start our homework.
What is it Laura? What's wrong?
I'm in a mess today, too.  I'm thinking about doing it with Mike. What do you think?
This is about sex, not like.  Mom, Laura's here and I think I will have one of those huckleberry muffins.  You want a muffin?
Where are the Cookies?
No.  I don't need to take this to be your friend.
Don't ever wear my stuff, don't ever wear my stuff. Never.
I won't wear your stuff.  I promise.
Laura, I am your friend.
How did I get in the house? How did I get into my bed?
But I love you, Laura.
You missed somethin', Ed.
A little trouble with your parents is the least of your worries and something I am certainly willing to put up with.
Did you make me a tape?
We were supposed to be together.
This afternoon?
What about tonight?
Oh, Laura.
No.
History is on our side, Ben. It's no accident that the great explorers were named Hennepin, Nicollet, Marquette.
You lied to me about those school books. I found them upstairs on your bed.
Where's Dad?
The Norwegians are coming next week and I want you to learn to say what I just learned in Norwegian. So you can talk to them. I want you to learn to say, "Hello, my name is Leland Palmer".
Hi, honey, how's Donna?
School?
Sit down... sit down... Are you hungry?
Who was that?
Did Bobby give you that or is there someone new?
What's wrong?
You're right. There's no one here.
So what I want to do is stop it here. I'm going to make him an offer. I want to do it myself. I want it to come from me.
I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win?
What are you doing here?
This is going to drive the ante up.
You would not...?
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that. Isn't that right?
Just now...
Now. I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed...?
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye. Is that correct?
Engaged to render an opinion. For a price. Is that correct? You're being paid to be here today?
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor. Certified in Internal Medicine?
How is that?
What book is that?
...of Anesthesiology?
I did.
Ed Concannon.
Objection, we've...
Mr. Concannon...?
Thank you, your Honor. We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetent and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code: 'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.' And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now: we object to the admission of the Xerox form.
Thank you. When Debby...
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat. Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby... Ms. Nevins...
Please sit down. I told your wife. I'm sorry that we have to meet out here. I've got a case coming in two days in the Superior Court and my office is a mess of papers.
You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up. Who do you think you are?  Who do you think you are...?
It's all right, Mickey.
I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case...
Cardiac arrest. During delivery her heart stopped. When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen. You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
I'm afraid that's not true.  Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
I am on the staff of...
They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much...
I'm sorry...?
The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of...
Thank you...
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
Uh-huh. My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
One hour.
I'm sure it is, Frank: and let me tell you something. If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?  See my point? Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
I need an extension for my case.
I had a witness disappear on me.
I got a letter from the Judge Advocate's office on you today, fella, you're on your way out... They should have kicked you out on that Lillibridge case. Now this is it today.
I object, your Honor...
I changed my life today. What did you do?
Is this a bad time.
What happened...?
That's not the question. It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault? If I'd... if I'd... I never should have taken it. There was no way that I was going to win.
You're pressuring yourself...
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
Pardon?
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no question of that. It's just a matter of how big...
Then why don't you testify?
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
I'm... Mrs. Doneghy? I'm Frank Galvin... why didn't you go in?
But what can we do? She don't know who's visiting her...
My doctor told me that I got to move out West... that's when we filed in court. We didn't want to sue...
Are we going to win?  We have, you know, other tactics, though...
Dr. Gruber.
Well, well, well. Huh?
Hi, Mickey...
Uh...
...now who is that...?
Sally Doneghy, now who is that?
Who have we got?
Forget it. You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.
Jimmy? Bushmills.  Lookit, do me a favor. I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
Today is Tuesday. What?
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
And all we've got is a witch doctor!
Rooney's protecting someone. Who is she protecting?
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
But those notations stop...  ...Four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
What happened in those three minutes...?
Yes.
A huge law firm. Okay? They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb. Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...' Okay...?
...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.  Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
Looks almost cold now, don't it?
We'd be the first to make contact with 'em -- see?
Hey, there - open up!
There's nobody left around here now.
I do know him...slightly.
How does it happen cars are running?
You'll hit something!  Can't you go higher?
I never noticed before - that's a cowboy tie....
I've been as close to them as anyone. But not close enough for real observation...
Very futuristic.  Yours doesn't really go with that butch haircut!
My kid brother has one.  You know why?
I got a message for you.  You're the guys from Pacific-Tech, ain't you?
What'll we say to 'em?
You mean that was a...
Sweetie, you've got lots of fans, we've done market studies.  You rate right up there.  We've already got Chase working on a prototype for the glove.
Maybe.  Or maybe I shouldn't do this interview today.
No, you don't.
It was nothing.  We were both working on some movie, and a special effects thing went horribly wrong.  Terry and Chuck were...hurt.  You were almost...  You were even cut.
What's up?
Ms. Langenkamp.  I'm afraid there are no evening visiting hours in Intensive Care.
These look quite fresh.
Ms. Langenkamp.  I suggest you go home and get some rest.  Your son is fine. He's been taken downstairs for further testing.
He was here.  You fell asleep.  We took him.  You looked so exhausted, frankly, we didn't wake you.  Besides, the young woman, Julie, is with him.  Believe me, everything is fine.
He's on his way.
Dylan, you go back to sleep now.
Do you have to die to see God?
Why does God let there be bad things?
Dylan, where's the man?
Yes.  It's a story.  A story for a movie.
Darker.  More...evil?
When do you think it'll be done?
I know what he's doing is bizarre, but most of the time he seems so normal, so well adjusted.  I just can't believe it's him.  I mean, and not something outside, influencing him.  Or is that how denial works?
A man, or a boy with a deep, y'know, Freddy voice.
Fred Krueger did it.
Is Chase Porter your husband?
I'm sorry, I can't.
I'll call the cops for you.  You've got the number on the fridge, right?
Like the Genie in the bottle.
If Freddy's loose, I mean, in your script, where's he going to go?  Another age?  Another form?
The way to stop him is to make another movie.  And I swear to you I'll stay at my computer and keep writing until I finish the script.  But when that time comes...  You're gonna have to make a choice.
I don't know if it has, really.  With the exception of One and Three, I've pretty much kept out of it.  I'm working in television now.  The hours let me spend more time with my husband and little boy.
Of course he is.  Freddy's dead and gone.
Oh, hi.  I'm fine, Sara.  My God, a voice from the past!
Uh...sure...when?
Can I get you something to drink?
Come in.
Everyone out of the rigging NOW!
How old are you, son?
There's still a way.
I walked in on my parents one time. It was only like eight o'clock and they were in bed and I thought that was kinda weird so I just walked in.
Who I am, outside of this boat. What the hell I'm doing here.
Hey, shut up will ya?
Yeah, but how are you supposed to make the first move?
But that's not the point...
It says she was originally Schooner rigged, but Captain Sheldrake turned her into a brigantine.  I think square rigs look so much more romantic.
Do you have your ticket?
Ya know... "It".
Who told you that?
Hold her steady into the wind. Southwest by west.
I mean he has all these expectations and he doesn't even know who his own kid is.  What right did then have to show up here?
Spying?!
Oh, really?
Who is it Philip?
I think you were too hard on Weathers.
And being sixteen.
Hell, they even kicked me outa vo- tech 'cause I couldn't read a slide rule.
Me, too.
How would you know?
What?  Come on...
They tell you that?
Why, man?
I don't.
We've got a problem.
They're waving... handkerchiefs or something.
How long you been standing there?
Do me a favor and tell Bill once she's dogged down I want everyone to break out their slickers and make sure their gear is stowed or we'll spend the next week sorting underwear.  Lawford, Bill, Mike, John, and Phil will stand the watch.  Everyone else hit the racks.
Is it true that you forced Robin Weathers to climb the mast when it was clear that he was acrophobic.
They are much more than that, sir.
For killing a dolphin.
There are allegations questioning your competence with regard to the command of the Albatross.  I have been instructed to convene a formal tribunal to determine whether or not negligence played a part in the sinking.
And you didn't do anything about it?
Soon as we ship it'll be "forgetta".
I can dig this music... But not that singer.
Can't all husbands be perfect, and your Elmo prob'ly wouldn'ta ever got that second one pregnant, you hadn't kicked his ass out.
Hey, pretty woman... Sailor here?
Wouldn'ta guessed it, that's sure.
Talked to her this afternoon... While you was out.
Just took a guess is all... You in or out on this deal?
What's she doin' here?
Why should it?
Nice of you to drop by.
Mostly black though in that boogie place.
Club Zanzibar.
Hey!!!... Johnnie Farragut. How are you, my man.
What'll it be? The regular? Black Label?
You hitched yet?
No big buildings like in New Orleans.
The Good Witch...
But I'm wild at heart.
Gotta admit, you guys are -  two in four dozen.
Well stop worryin' about me and start worryin' about how you're gonna get that Lula back here and away from that murderer.
Really, Marietta, you got more scenarios swimmin' around in your brain than Carter got pills. Try to take it easy. Go over to Myrtle Beach for a few days.
I got some news, Marietta. Lula and Sailor been here. They checked out of the Hotel Brazil on Frechman Street yesterday.
Who was that?... Who know's your here?
Let's head for Texas and see if we can pick up the trail.
Heard grandpa Santos and grandmama talkin'.
In a fire, as I recall.
That's true. Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle. He was a business partner of my daddy's? And my mama never knew nothin' about me and him - that's for damn sure. His real name was somethin' kind of European, like Pucinski. But everyone just called him Pooch. He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I was surprised more'n a little.
Well, sure. But he was super-gentle, you know? I mean, he raped me and all, but I guess there's all different kinds of rapes. I didn't exactly want him to do it but I suppose once it started, it didn't seem all that terrible. It was over pretty quick, and after Uncle Pooch just stood there and pulled up his trousers and left me there. I stayed in bed till I heard him drive off. Then I just went back into the kitchen and finished makin' my sandwich.
Just you. Uncle Pooch never acted strange or different after. And he never did anything else to me. I always got a nice present from him at Christmas, like a coat or jewelry?
What's that honey?
I'm sorry, sweetie. I forget some moments where all you been the last two years.
He's twenty-four now? A year older than you? And must be 'bout bald.
When she got almost to the top step I stuck my hand between her legs from behind.
She just rolled over onto her stomach and stuck her ass up in the air. I slid my hand between her legs and she closed her thighs on it.
Her face was half-pushed into the pillow, and she looked back over her shoulder at me and said, 'I won't suck you. Don't ask me to suck you.'
M-i-ss-i-ss-i-pp-i... You can almost hear that jazz blowin' up from the big N.O.
My God,  it better be, darlin', cause it'd be the last... What time is it?
Lula, sometimes I gotta admit, you come up with some weird thoughts...
I do.
Talkin's good. Long as you got the other? I'm a big believer in talkin', case you ain't noticed.
Sometimes dreams just don't mean nothin'... Stuff comes into your mind and you don't have no control over, you know? Anyways, dreams ain't no odder than real life. Sometimes not by half.
Who do?
Oh my God... It's Johnnie... Duck down!... Get goin'!
He was sittin' there havin' a beignet at the Cafe Du Monde. Do you think he saw us?
Sure you wanna do this? Might be a way they could track us.
Well, she ain't talked to nobody and ain't nobody spoke to her that I could tell. What you make of that?
More'n likely.
Honey, I'm sorry. It wasn't nothin'. Come on and get up and we'll take off.
What's that, peanut?
Sure is a big deal round here... Alamo Road, Alamo Street, Alamo Square, Alamo Buildin', Alamo Alamo. They ain't forgettin' about it in a hurry. That's the thing 'bout memory? Some things you wish you could forget... What's troublin' you, sugar?
You're scarin' me, baby.
You upset with me?
That night in the fire while my daddy was dyin'... I saw mama up in her room with Santos...
It's a comfortin' idea.
There's worse places, honey.
We'll be alright, peanut, long as we've got room to move.
Well, it ain't exactly Emerald City...
Not bad for eleven dollars a day.
Now what?
You find any work?
Sailor? You know what?
I know. Just I'm sorta uncomfortable about the way some things is goin', and this don't help soothe me.
Yeah... He was lookin' for you.
Buddy told me about that thing at Cao Ben?
What're you talkin' about? That's your son in there.
In the Ganges near Varanasi to try and reduce human pollution and now plan to put in the crocodiles to devour floatin' corpses dumped by Hindus too poor to pay for cremation.
Mama???
I'm fine, mama. I just wanted to tell you not to worry.
You're comin' home, precious. Santos' gonna drive us to the San Antonio airport.
I'm goin', mama. No way I can't go.
Figure we'll go have supper someplace. Maybe get some barbecue out by Stateline. Sailor always liked that Havana Brown's Pig Pickin'.
Perhaps we should call a local law enforcement officer.
Have it your way... But you want it.
Take care of him?
Get rid of him?
You need to explain it.
Simple? Kill him? How?
Explain it... I told you.
Where? In the leg?
Wrong! It's much better to blow a hole in the back of the head... right toward the bridge of the nose... Lots and lots of irreparable damage.
Santos... What's happenin' here?
Well, Johnnie told me you used to drive for Clyde and Santos...
So maybe one night you got a little too close to the fire... And you're gonna get burned, baby... And besides that, you're shit... D'you think I'd let my little girl go with shit like you?... Why, you belong right here in one of these toilets.
Oh, don't worry 'bout that...
Oh... Look at this... What do you want, snakeskin?
You really are one dumb asshole.
I ain't heard of nothin'.
That's just how my brain works, I guess.
You snore.
No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look sorta crappy.
It's the Chancellor.
I was explaining to Antonia how a book comes to be published. What you do as a writer, what I do as an editor...
Emily?
Do you know how many times I've boarded an airplane praying someone like her would sit down beside me? Particularly while I'm on my way to Pittsburgh.
You're stoned.
Left you...? Who? Emily?
Christ, Crabs, what do you expect me to do? The kid's practically in a coma.
What's this guy's problem?
Tripp?!
Listen, Hannah, I'm flattered, really, but right now I --
You stay there.
James? My James? What's happened?
Kidnapped? By who?
You know -- based on what I've read -- this is a very exciting piece of material, this Big Parade.
So modest.
Shut up, James.
Oh! Huh. Exactly how do we do that?
Such as.
There's only one problem, Tripp. We don't know his real name. We just made it up. In fact, we made the whole guy up.
The jacket, Tripp. We need the jacket.
Me? What can I do?
You peeked, didn't you?
How are you -- is it Joe?
The last month maybe.
Vernon.
Let me get this straight. All that paper that went into the river. That was the only copy?
What? No. There's no one here. I'm just... just...
It's just... for good luck. Some people carry rabbits' feet...
Are you and Hannah seeing each other, James?
Listen, James, about this afternoon. In workshop. I'm sorry. I think I let things get a bit out of control.
Well...
The one she wore on her wedding day?
Trust me, James, when the family pet's been assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear one of her students was the triggerman.
Can I ask you something about her?
Shit. He must've left it back at Thaw. In the auditorium.
Oh.
But... ?
How did I get here last night?
And... and before that. Did I do anything? Anything bad?
How's that?
There is, but it's not that interesting.
I've got a thing about, places like this. I know what those houses are like. I know what the people are like.
Outside Scranton.
It's a hellhole. Three motels and a mannequin factory. My dad worked there for thirty-five years.
The one that left you?
Someone jumped on your car with their butt...
Because you act like a goddamn spook all the time. Not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you.
Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You said so yourself.
It's okay, Professor Tripp. Carrie, Howard, the others -- they're right. My stories are annoying. They go on and on and on, and the longer they go on the more annoying they become, until finally you just want to grab something heavy and --
I'm sorry.
That's why you're having them. Your spells.
It's because you don't eat.
When?
You just worry about yourself, James. Okay?
Where you going?
I'm not going, with them.
I'm a little worried, James.
Professor Tripp...?
That strikes me as odd.
His bag. You know that ratty green thing he's always carrying around. He must've left it inside.
The aunt, Hannah. Where did you take James that day?
New?
No, really, Sara, I don't think you --
I don't think I really have a choice in, that. Emily left me.
Who's gun is that?
Who's that sitting in your car?
Oh?
And what do you think you might have said?
I know.
Did you tell Walter?
He's writing his name in water.
Walter?
Oh?
No. I guess you're here for the backpack.
Oh, right. Yeah, that's true. He used to rub all kinds of things on it. Paprika. Ground lamb.
What made you pull out that old thing?
Well, there's always people you don't know at these things, but I can't say there was anybody particularly suspicious... Wait. There was one guy. Tiny fella. Claimed to be a jockey.
Huh? Oh, someone pulled a B&E on Dr. Gaskell's closet. And the dog's missing.
Are you riding with me, James?
George Sanders?
There's so many...
Don't need to think fast to handle beer.
Foreman now.
Hey, is that a school?
One hundred and twenty feet.
I should go. Your sister worries, and when she worries she yells.
Annette? She's good... tense.
Cherry.
Notice the grain. See how deep and rich the red runs?
She was going to throw it out, wasn't she? Just toss it like a scrap of wood.
Then what? What?!
What party?
Ah, come on.
The important thing is that you and Annette need to talk. She needs to see you, and you need to see her.
Nothing.
What do you mean?
There's little chicks!  You want to see?
I don't like starlings.
They're extremely aggressive birds. Plus, their habits are rather filthy.
It's just a city park.
I'd love to hear it.
You should hear the bird.
Not too far.  Are you a bird-watcher too?
What are you writing in that book?
A pretty girl like you should have a lot of friends.
I haven't broken any laws.
I would.
Doesn't everybody?
And when you sit by the window, watching the girls in the little cotton skirts parade by, do you wave your wanger at the girls? Is that when you jerk off?
That's a nasty scratch on your neck.
Sergeant Lucas.  May I come in?
The new man. I'd keep away from him, if I were you.
Just trying to be helpful.
Walter.
No.
A long time ago, I was sent far away. When they let me come back, all my friends were gone.
Banished... yeah.
Robin?
But will he... ?
You seem a little hostile today.
Walter, I'd like you to try something for me.
But you don't like coming here. Be honest, Walter.
Because if you did, I know a therapist named Ryan. I also know a therapist named Chung.
Why do you think you're here?
Is that what you are angry about?
How do they know?
Fuck you, Rosen!
Walter, we'll pick up here next time.
Where?
A nap?
What the hell are you doing there?
Don't ever do that again.
When the two of you held each other. When you were ten or eleven and she was eight or nine. When your parents were out and the two of you were alone... completely alone in that big house.
Want a ride?
There's something wrong with this picture.
You don't hang out with the other guys.
Are you?
Southern light.
Your windows face south. Northern light is the purest. But southern light is very good.
Is that a school?
Something happened to you.
I thought I'd stay the night.
Is that all?
Hey, there.
Why do you want to know?
I never hurt them. Never.
Why don't you just go now, okay?
I've changed.
You really believe that?
You know, this is crazy.
Maybe this isn't a good idea.
You're scared.
Most people don't have my kind of problems.
I say we call it quits.
Nice shot, Lins.
What's goin' on, Boss?
Where are we?
Lord Almighty.
Thanks.  How you feeling, big guy?
We were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work.  We had over seven thousand feet of hole down for Chrissake.  I can't believe you let them grab my rig!
I haven't worn mine in months.
So what about "Michael" then... Mr. Brooks Brothers... Mr. BMW.  You still seeing him?
Jammer saw something in there, something that scared the hell out him--
I think it likes you.
It's flooding like a son of the bitch.
Try again.
I know!  I know!  But we better come up with something.
It is insane.
Oh God, Lins... I--
We'll take reading as we go.  If the reactor's breached or the warheads have released radioactive debris, we'll back away.  Simple.
Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me, you start ordering my guys around.  It won't work.  You gotta know how to handle these people... we have a certain way of doing things here.
We'll go in through that large breach.
What's the matter with you?
That's Perry.
Do we just leave him there?
Hafta... go on to... the moonpool.  Only way.
Hippy, you pussy.
Get comfortable.  The bad news is we got six hours in this can, blowing down.  The worse news is it's gonna take us three weeks to decompress back to the surface later.
24 Trident missiles.  Eight MIRVs per missile.
Figured that out for yourself, did you?
Schoenick... your Lieutenant is about to make a real bad career move...
He can't get to the door... I think he's going to try and take him himself.
You boss is having a full-on meltdown.  Guy's fixing to pull the pin on fifty kilotons and we're all ringside!
High-Pressure Nervous Syndrome.  Muscle tremors, usually in the hands first.  Nausea, increased excitability, disorientation.
4800 feet.  It's official.
He can still make it.
Would we see the flash?
But your friend is waiting downstairs.
Then how come you're not with him?
How are you?
No. It's not enough... I told you before that I would like to get away for a while and be alone.
Claudia, aren't you coming?
And how long will you be away?
I presume by this method that you'll be able to uncover some new clue, either a handkerchief or an article of clothing... In other words, something which your men have not been able to find as yet.
Allow me to inform you that my daughter is not a fugitive.
This looks to me like a good sign. Don't you think so? As far as I'm concerned, anyone who reads the Bible could not have committed an act of impropriety. Why... as a matter of fact, I remember when I was in China, many years ago, I happened to be involved in a similar situation, concerning an English woman, the wife of Ambassador Shafford, a good friend of mine. There, too, we found a Bible... And I said at the time that whatever had happened, that clue alone had definitely ruled out the possibility of... suicide. Why, it was logical, I said, that whoever reads the Bible believes in God and therefore...  No? You don't believe it? Well, as a matter of fact, I was right... The woman was found two days later. It was a case of amnesia.
How wonderful!
Nothing but the usual argument... The only thing was -- if I remember correctly -- that she said she had a need to be alone.
And yet, she seemed to feel that our love for her -- mine, yours, even her father's, in a certain sense -- weren't enough for her, or didn't mean much to her.
For me they are exactly as they were when we met three days ago -- just three days ago... don't you realize? And you and Anna... No, I guess they aren't like that any more. My God, is it possible to forget in such a short time, for things to change so quickly?
No, I'm sure it won't. Move over there. Let's make believe nothing happened. And when we get to the next station, get off.
Any news?
Sandro ... maybe it's best that you go in alone.
Good. It's better if it were absurd. That would mean nothing much can be done about it.
Really, I've got to stop this business with Ettore... I would like to go back and start working on my own projects again. You know, I had many ideas...
You look at me as though I had said something foolish...
But why am I so infatuated with you?
Sandro ...What's the matter?
Good night, my love.
I don't love you.
Well, with a shark running loose around the place, I for one won't get aboard that raft! They'll have to catch it first. I want to see it right here before my feet, dead or alive.
He amuses me. I don't know of anything more amusing. Outside of this jigsaw puzzle. Don't you find it so, Claudia?
What amazes me, is Sandro. He seems so calm.
I just can't leave without first searching those islands, one by one.
But where did you finally end up?
Do you consider that a compliment?
Now what do I have to do to be left in peace?
At one time the Aeolian isles were all volcanoes.
What happened?
Why didn't you ask me to go with you?
Looks like the weather is changing.
I wonder where they could have unloaded the stuff ... Maybe right here at Lisca.
And who is this?
Where is she going?
Because there is no landscape as beautiful as a woman.
Oh, there are as many as one wants.
Yes, sir. Three times.
What other boat?
And what did they say about me?
Certainly a radio this small is very practical. It's especially useful for... I don't know... for traveling.
But where did you come from?
You should have told Ettore. He always manages to get what he wants.
Why have we stopped?
Here I am, Patrizia. I'm always here.
She costs a hundred thousand lire.
I can't say.
No.
Because I'm getting fat.
Look at the statues, they're thin.
Mommy I'll get bigger and bigger every day and then I'll pop but... but if I stay little it won't happen.
But she watches... she listens.
I don't know.
Hello. I'm Doctor Livingston. I've been asked to talk to you. May I?
No I'm not.
Let's talk about something else.
First thing that comes to your mind?
Second thing that comes to your mind.
Well do you love... do you love Father Martineau?
Where do you meet?
Yes.
What baby?
I... I don't understand.
What's your real name?
Would you like to be?
Would you like some?
Do you know a Marie?
What else did she tell you?
I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head?
It's like hiding from my mother when I was a little girl.
Why not?  Mmm?
If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one?
How would that person get one if they didn't want one?
Agnes, I don't believe you know nothing about sex...
... that you don't remember getting pregnant...
What the child?
Please!  I want to help you. Let me help you.
You're listening to a chorus of angels. The music surrounds you like a... warm and, comfortable pool of water. And while you're sleeping, you're going to be able to recall, all the things that we want you to remember. And when I count to three and clap my hands, you'll no longer be hypnotised. Can you hear me.
Did you want it to come out?
To be a mother?
No not yet Agnes, very soon but not yet. How did the baby get into you?
Who?  Who made you promise?  It's alright Agnes. It's alright.  Let's go to your room. It's the night about six weeks ago when you were very sick.
Hm hmm. What did you have for dinner?
What is it?
Who?
A crucifix.
No.
Which one?
Agnes, can you hear me?
Yes.
So I could go to him.
It's bleeding... I'm bleeding... my God it won't stop, I can't get it to stop.  Let go of me, I wish you were dead.
I hate him for what he did to me.
Mother Miriam was with you wasn't she?
You saw it all didn't you?
And then... what did she do?  Agnes what did she do?
Larry there's got to be something missing.
Thanks. 
No, no, no...
Yes.
Do you still go to church?
Who knew about Agnes' pregnancy?
Is that normal?
Didn't she have any physical examinations in this time?
Could there have been anyone else?
She can't even remember the birth. Do you think she'd admit to the conception?
Exactly. I want you do deal with Agnes as speedily and as easily as possible. She won't hold up under any sort of cross examination.
Well... what do you think?  Is she totally bananas or merely slightly off centre... or maybe she's perfectly sane and just a very good liar.
She didn't!  This is manslaughter, not murder. She didn't consciously kill that baby. She'd lost a lot of blood. She was unconscious by the time we got to her.
The Catholic Church...
She is not a child.
What good would it do. No matter what you decide it's either the... the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin.
What?
Visitors to the convent.
When was that?
Like keeping her home from school?
Because I am a moral person.
I wasn't. I wasn't. She was the pretty one. She died, why not me?  I never said my morning prayers. And I was ugly, I was scrawny, I had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me Polkadot Livingston.
Even Christ would partake socially.
Pipe!
Right.  What do you suppose today's saints are smoking?
Do you think they ever existed?
For Agnes.
Don't be ridiculous.
A miracle is an event without an explanation. If she's capable of putting a hole in her hand without benefit of a nail, why couldn't she split a cell in her womb?
That's what I have to believe...
Oh, would you stop lying Mother!
This is permission to take her apart.
And you didn't send her to a doctor.
The baby?
You hid the wastepaper basket in her room.
She can't remember.
How fascinating. Do go on ...  ... John.
Lay them down.
Here, mate, that's my hoop, stop playing with it.
Gerron out of it, you're only jealous 'cause you're old.
Yeah, I've blown school out.
No, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding Dong.
Yeah.
Ginger's mad, he says things all the time and Eddy's good at punching and spitting.
The police have the poor unfortunate lad in the Bridewell.
Sure.
That's right retreat behind a smoke screen of bourgeois cliches. I don't go round messing about with your ear-phones, do I?
Yeah, you know, "O.K. Buster, follow that car, there's a sawbuck in it for you if you get real close!"
We're nearly there, sir.
He doesn't like me, honest, I can tell ... It's 'cos I'm little.
Me? Why?
Only Susan Campey, our resident teenager. You'll have to love her. She's your symbol.
Get him out of here!!
You see, he was going to get married but she threw him over for a butcher.
Aye and we'll have to watch it and all.
Aye, but don't rush. None of your five bar gate jumps and over sort of stuff.
What's up?
Ringo!
Eh, I don't know if you realise it, but ...
Oh, there you are!
No, I didn't you did ...
Sorry.
Oh!
Are you supposed to be here?
You're from Liverpool, aren't you?
What are you?
... all this and a jam butty too!!
Well, look at it this way, I mean, when you come right down to it, that girl, she's a bit of a scrubber, isn't she?
And what do you do about it?
Parading's better!
That's it, parading the streets ... trailing your coat ... bowling along ... living!
You're only right.
And if they get you on the floor watch out for your brisket.
You ugly, great brute you, you have sadism stamped all over your bloated British kisser.
I'll go on a hunger strike. I know your caper. The kidney punch and the rabbit-clout. The third degree and the size twelve boot ankle-tap.
And we're looking after him, are we?
Come on let's get this coffee.
Yeah ... so what?
Well, don't be daft, I've got to.
With a trombone hooter like yours it'd be unnatural if you didn't.
And another thing, where's that old mixer?
Is that yours?
Aye, he looks a right lurker.
Well we know that but what's he doing here?
Aye, that's what I'm afraid of!
Let's have you.
Leave him alone, he's got swine fever.
Leave him alone, Lennon, or I'll tell them all the truth about you.
Hi Norm!
You've got a midnight matinee.
No, you look here, John. I've only one thing to say to you.
Oh, wait a minute, don't tell me you're ...
Is it?
He's betrayed the class.
Temper! Temper!
And?
I've got the stuff. Come here.
That's mine.
Oh dear, I feel like doing a bit of work.
Down the ... er ...
I'm adjusting the decibels on the inbalance.
"The Management of Boyd's takes pleasure in requesting the company of Mr. Richard Starkey, that's you, in their recently refinished gaming rooms. Chemin de Fer. Baccarat, Roulette, and Champagne Buffet." Blimey!
Eh. I thought you were looking after the old man.
I'll set John on you!
Oh, a little savage, is he?
Engines off.
Good!  Maybe we'll be able to see something then.
Just machinery.
Can we come up?
Dell, you want to come down, we can figure out where to go from here.
How do you feel, Dell?
Computer, what language was that?
Just <u>hold it</u>, <u>hold it</u>!  Computer: have you attempted to analyze the transmission?
Unknown!  What do you mean?
Computer!  I've turned all the cooling units back on!  What's wrong?
Well, get started.
Hello, Faust!
You like this shit?
But we can't kill it.  If we kill it, it will spill all its body acids right through our hull and out into space.
Okay.
What happened to the lights?
Hurt!  How?
Oh -- God -- oh --
And then we run out of food and oxygen.
That one section of the ventilator shaft has only two outlets -- you notice?  The food storage room on one end --
Then why the hell are you sitting around here?
It's really on there tight.
Hey, are you guys still there? What's going on?
God, that smoke's poisonous!
We can't go into hypersleep with that thing running around loose.
It's over, Hunter.
That thing, God almighty, didn't you try to get it off him?
There.  Should be coming through about there.
Yes?
He's running a fever.
While the rest of us wait down in the cooling unit with the net.
We've got six hours left.
Oh no!  We can't fight this thing! There's only six hours of air left -- we're dead men!
What?  What was that?
Why, you chickenshit bastard --
Oh no.
I keep my mouth pretty much shut, but I don't like hitting.
This is horrible.
Blow the ship up?
If you press the button right now, it will blow the whole nose of the ship off.
Well, we can't go anywhere in this darkness.  How long till dawn?
Air lock?
Here's his line.  We can haul him out of there if we have to.
But what can we do?  He's out of radio contact.
That's the one about the albatross, right?
We came out there, we'll go back.  A long time by the clock, but a short time to us.
I've got Hunter... and something else as well, in front of him.
They're on the next level up.
Source of transmission is to the northeast... about 300 meters.
These day and night cycles are totally disorienting.  I feel like we've been here for days, but it's only been how long?
Ten to the fourth dynes per square centimeter.
Martin, uh, we've found it.
What would you say that was supposed to mean?
This ship is full of cat hair.
I understand why you did that.
Where did the parasites come from?
What's it doing, having a seizure?
That'll blow the ship up.
No good... it's eaten too much of me...
Headache?  Dehydration?
Me either.  I tell you, I used to be with a mining outfit on Callisto, and when something like that hits... believe me, you know about it.
Yeah, it's fine.
Nice howitzer you've got there.
Good argument for gun-control.  What are you going after, rhino?
We've got no option.  We're gonna have to get it off.
Minh...
I found it...
Fucking great.  I invested some money in them.
Picking up velocity.
Auto-shop's sealed, but those boys are cut-off.
C'mon, man.  One more sweep.
Ah, quit griping.  Keeps you in shape doesn't it?
Listen to what?
What?  Are you nuts?  Just the two of us?
Hold it, hold it...
What?  Where?
Wait.  Lost it.
Move it baby, or they're gonna be chewin' on my cojones!
What happened?
That sounds promising.  Can we operate the crane from here?
Is this the suit?
Fort Powell.  What do we tell 'em?
See that sheathing on the suspension? Eaten away.  Same thing with the pumps on the base air purifiers.  The algae out here just isn't good on these new plastics.
What is that?
Any luck raising Ackland's party?
I'm going to need you to co-sign the report.  Until we come up with something, this'll be treated as first degree murder.
What?
I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.
Jesus.
How's it going?
How do you know my name?
May I come in?
We all come into this world with our little egos equipped with individual horns. If we don't blow them - who will?
Hungry?
I'm not surprised. After all that humble pie...
It'll be a night to remember. It'll bring to me everything I've ever wanted. The end of an old road - and the beginning of a new one...
We're?
I didn't mean just the Theater.
You sat and talked until it was light...
I still don't know what you're getting at. Right now I want to take my nap. It's important that I-
You used my name and my column to blackmail Karen into getting you the part of "Cora" - and you lied to me about it!
Exactly.  Here. Take it to the party instead of me.
That isn't a waiter, my dear. That's a butler.
Answer me this. What makes a man become a producer?
In my case it's necessary. Too many taxi drivers write plays.
Then stop being a star - start treating your guests as your supporting cast!
I was there. An eyewitness.
The ladies' - shall we say - lounge?
Miss Caswell got lucky too late. The audition is over.
Didn't you know?
It wasn't reading, it was a performance. Brilliant, vivid, something made of music and fire...
In time she'll be what you are.
Eve was incredibly modest. She insisted that no credit was due her, that Lloyd felt as he did only because she read lines exactly as he had written them.
Is it sabotage, does my career mean nothing to you? Have you no human consideration?
She's quite a girl, that what's-her name...
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?
What a thoughtful, ever-lovin' thing to do-
You in a hurry?
Bill... Bill, it's your birthday.
She did...?
Happy little housewife...
Well, we started talking, she wanted to know all about Hollywood, she seemed so interested...
I can't believe you're making this up - it sounds like something out of an old Clyde Fitch play...
Mad! Darling, there are certain characteristics for which you are famous - on stage and off. I love you for some of them - and in spite of others. I haven't let those become too important to me. They're part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment - you've got to keep your teeth sharp. All right. But you will not sharpen them on me - or on Eve...
Wouldn't you feel more natural taking a bow?
"Please forgive me for butting into what seems such a happy occasion - but it's most important that I speak with you. Please" - it's underlined - "meet me in the Ladies' Room. Eve."
Groom-  - may I have a wedding present?
Never try to outguess Margo.
Hello, what's your name?
Just wondered what?
Why what?
- little things here and there, it doesn't matter. You can be proud of yourself, you've got a right to be.
You think?
The bed looks like a dead animal act. Which one is sables?
She's on her way. With half the men in the joint.  It's only a fur coat...
It was Fort Sumter they fired on-
When we get home you're going to get into one of those girdles and act for two and half hours.
She works hard.
I ain't dense. And he's been here twenty minutes.
How long does it take?
There isn't another like you, there couldn't be-
If I only knew how...
You're not going, are you?
Discouraging, isn't it? Women with furs like that where it never gets cold...
Mrs. Richards.
I think she would cheer.
The reason is Margo and don't try to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.
I don't expect you to be pleasant.
After all you've said... don't you know the part was written for Margo?
I guess it started back home. Wisconsin, that is. There was just mum, and dad - and me. I was the only child, and I made believe a lot when I was a kid - I acted out all sorts of things... what they were isn't important. But somehow acting and make-believe began to fill up my life more and more, it got so that I couldn't tell the real from the unreal except that the unreal seemed more real to me... I'm talking a lot of gibberish, aren't I?
Back to Copacabana. But Eve. Margo, let me tell you about Eve-
Stick around. Please. Tell you what - we'll put Stanislavsky on his plane, you and I, then go somewhere and talk.
The curtains. I made them myself.
Well - what do you think of my elegant new suit?
Oh, come now, as though you were an old lady... I'm on my way. Is there anything more you've thought of-?
Right here.
Oh, golly. And I forgot to tell you-
Terribly sorry I'm late, lunch was long and I couldn't find a cab - where's Miss Caswell, shall we start? Oh, hello, Eve...
Well, if you'd been here to begin with, I wouldn't have dared to read at all...
... and if you'd come in the middle, I'd have stopped, I couldn't have gone on-
Would you like a drink? It's right beside you...
Margo, nothing you've ever done has made me as happy as your taking Eve in...
He always looks so pathetic whenever he does anything physical-
Come to think of it, I haven't been very pleasant for weeks. For that, I'm truly sorry. More than any two people I know, I don't want you and Lloyd to be angry with me...
What about Bill?
In this rat race, everybody's guilty till they're proved innocent! One of the differences between the Theater and civilization...  ... what gets me is how all of those papers in town happened to catch that particular performance!
You can't put her out, I promised... Margo, you've got to see her, she worships you, it's like something out of a book-
Now let's not get into a big hassle-
It's just possible she didn't...
Margo hasn't done badly by it.
She's been to see me, as a matter of fact she left just before you came in - you just missed her...
Eve did mention the play, you know. But just in passing - she's never ask to play a part like "Cora," she'd never have the nerve...
Lloyd Richards, you are not to consider giving that contemptible little worm the part of "Cora."
Who is it? What's it all about?
Have you forgotten about Eve? What she is, what she's done?
Honey chili had a point. You know, I can remember plays about women - even from the South - where it never even occurred to them whether they wanted to marry their fathers more than their brothers...
There you are, both of you. Max, Karen has decided it's time to go.
Who's left out there?
Spoken like an author.  Lloyd, I'm not twentyish. I am not thirtyish. Three months ago, I was forty years old. Forty. Four oh.  That slipped out, I hadn't quite made up my mind to admit it. Now I feel as if I'd suddenly taken all my clothes off...
She's your understudy.
I'm sure.
You knew when you came in that the audition was over, that Eve was your understudy! Playing that childish game of cat and mouse...
Yes, sir.
Very discreet. A note right out in the open like that. Next time tell your lover to blow smoke rings - or tap a glass...
... and Bill. Especially Bill. Eve did that, too.
That depends.
Hello..
Then this will be five. I suppose you think I'm too drunk to count.
"Liebestraum."
Let the rest of the world beat their brains out for a buck. It's friends that count. And I got friends.
Miss Caswell?  What?
Not at all. And you could do me a big favor, if you would-
Think of your health, Max - more time to relax out in the fresh air at a race track...
This is for lawyers to talk about, this concerns a run-of-the-play contract, and this you can't rewrite or ad lib!
Are you breaking the contract?
Who am I to threaten? I'm a dying man.
--it was fine the way it was--
--I have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from Virginia?--
That was fun.  What now?
---fifteen or more phone calls from the burglars in Miami to Gordon Liddy at CREEP--
See her?  Get anything?
And?--And?--
I don't get it... this really was my turf...
We understand your problem--
I hate both parties.
Republican?
Who'd you vote for?
--she was really paranoid, the bookkeeper.
Look--five men controlled that slush fund as CREEP--three of them we've got, Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, and we're pretty sure of Kalmbach.
--we gotta top the Times--
--I want you to shut up and listen to me--
Segretti criss-crossed the country over ten times in six months--and never stayed anyplace over a night or two.  Switch to another station, huh? You're driving me crazy with that.
California, Illinois, Florida, New Hampshire--all the major Democratic primary states.  Why does everything you play sound the same?
You think this was Clawsen's initiation?
--That cash fund that financed the sabotaging of the Democrats--five guys had control--
Nah.  Maybe.
--jeeeeeeesus--
Morning or night?
I never could figure just who this Dahlberg was.  Think it might be anything?
I'd really like to see Mr. Dardis.
I called him from Washington. He's the one who asked me to be here at eleven in the morning.
Could you reach Mr. Dardis by car radio?
Listen--we know you're involved in this--we're going to get the story, why not help?
Do you feel much about the things you did?
During the Florida primary, you wrote a letter on Muskie stationery saying Scoop Jackson had a bastard child. You wrote another that said Hubert Humphrey was out with call girls.
But you know who did.
Sure--off the record.
Down to Miami and back--how much damage can I do?
--Bernstein, are you sure on this story?
Hannah, I never would have bothered you but I'm off to Miami and they're gonna take away my ten speed unless I get it straightened out fast.
Oh, they're here.  I'm keeping much better records now, Hannah.  See? 
I thought you had to get to Miami.
This is practically a high school reunion for us, Jane--I would have sprung for a classier place.
FBI too?
We don't tell anyone that. Which is why you can talk to us. And if we can't verify what you say someplace else, we don't print it. That's another reason you can relax.
One minute but then--
I was just curious--you don't do it well, so I wondered. Have you been threatened, if you told the truth, is that it?
There are too many people watching me--they know I know a lot--
A lot of it was. I just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund--you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that.
There were a group of them--I think five, I don't know their names.
Gordon Liddy, you mean?
Try and understand this. I'm a decent Republican. I believe in Richard Nixon. I worked in the White House four years--so did my wife. What happened on June 17 I don't think the President knew anything about. Some of his men I'm not so sure of.
Ordinarily, though, what was the procedure?
--what do you think?--
Douglas Caddy, the attorney of record, when questioned about his presence in the courtroom, denied he was in the courtroom, "I'm not here," Mr. Caddy said.
Are you implying you don't believe me?
You claiming it was all a misunderstanding, Ken?
Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing: where did your talk with Berger happen?
I saw the flag signal--what's up?
Follow the money. Always follow the money.
My turn to keep you waiting.  What's the topic for tonight?
Why did they do all this for Chrissakes?--what were they after?
There were more then.
And Justice and FBI know all this?
Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats?
--I know, I know, the pressure's off the White House and it's all back on the Post--
Where in government?
You know, the paper was my father's and my husband's when they were alive and I was thinking back a year or two ago when Ben called me and said he wanted to publish the Pentagon Papers the next day. The Times had already been stopped from publishing anymore of them and all my legal counsel said "don't, don't" and I was frightened but I knew if I said no, I'd lose the whole fifth floor. So we published, and that night, after I'd told Ben to go ahead, I woke up in the darkness and I thought, "Oh my Lord, what am I doing to this newspaper?"  I woke up again last night with that same question.  Are we right on this story?
You've never told anyone who he is?  But you'd have to tell me if I asked you.  Tell me.
As usual, that keen mind of yours has pegged the situation perfectly.  Except  it wasn't local Democratic Headquarters, it was National Democratic Headquarters--  --and  these weren't just any idiots, these were special idiots, seeing as when they were arrested at 2:30 this morning, they were all wearing business suits and Playtex gloves and were carrying--  --a walkie-talkie, forty rolls of film, cameras, lock picks, pen-sized tear gas guns, plus various bugging devices.  Not to mention over two thousand dollars, mostly in sequenced hundred dollar bills.
OK, get on this W.House guy and do a better job then you did on McCord.
What'd you get on W.House?
Anything?
I can predict the next words you're gonna say: "anyone but Bernstein."  I want to send a reporter to Miami.
That was awhile ago.
--has any of them got an ax?--
--listen, I love this country, you think I want to bring it down?--I'm not some goddamn zany, I was a hawk--
What do you think Mrs. Graham wants to see me for?
The report on the cash in Maurice Stans' safe, the three hundred fifty thousand, that's true?
--and it wasn't Ehrlichman or Colson or the President.
You work there, Miss Abbott.
No, it was good.
What did you just say?
Alright, well...you've got to tone it down.  You don't need to go to Lookout Point and spout cheeseball lines to be romantic.
Finch, don't you think it's about time you learned to take a dump at school?
Oh no, no date.  Bathroom incident.
...Nevermind.  You have anything to drink?
I had no idea you'd be this good!
Of course, Finch.  What?
You know, Jim...you could go back there...and...
Finch, listen -- Stifler slipped some sort of laxative in your Mocash-chino or whatever.  It's fast acting.  I mean <u>really</u> fast.
I just -- realized that I didn't know anything about you.  I was interested.
Nice car.
What?  No I'm not.
So you're going to Michigan?
Well, I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but what am I gonna be, a pro lacrosse player?  I really have no idea.
Well, you're not.  Oil and vinegar?
I can't think of anything to say that's not cheesy.
Jessica, can you drive me home?
Alright...I'm shooting for a nine o'clock ETA.  Beer in hand by five after.
Ow, what the hell?
Yeah, it's like tradition or something.
Hey, where's Finch?
That's stupid.
Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!
Thank you, dad, I got it.
Hold on.  You have no idea why I'm angry?
Oh, I've got stories, believe me. They're a little more risque than tales of Band Camp.
Illegal channels?  Shit, if there's any channel that should be illegal, it's whatever that women's channel is. Lifetime Supply of Pantyhose, or some shit.
Hey guys, you came to watch me in action?
I still think you're okay.
Uh...
You are done, James.  Perhaps I should be going now.
SUCK ME, BEAUTIFUL!
Ho-lee shit.
Oh, Kev.
Kevin?  Do you not love me?
Kevin...you're not your dad.  The two of us, we're not your parents.
And I want to make things perfect for you.  You're right, Kev, we do have something good...and special.
Now?!
See -- this is the nicest room.
You sure you're comfortable?
Like, normal style.  The...missionary position.
You called me to ask me how to get laid?
Uh -- forget that.  Look, is that all you're interested in?  Ways to get your girlfriend into bed?
And little hurly-burly came by in her curly-wurly, and asked me if I needed I ri-hide --
Contact, dude.
So, I'm thinking prom is basically our last big chance.
Dammit, Kevin, what's with the attitude?
And by the way, Sherman didn't even get laid.
Yeah, but we'll still see each other.
Hah!  Yeah, Oz, I bet it's more like your dad works at <u>her</u> store.
Hanging is nice. Never goes out of style. What about hare-kare - a taste of the Orient? But no! You're in Paris! Try the Guillotine! There's one in the Louvre!
Merde! Just missed!
Merde! I can't believe this!
Either way works for us...
Actually, I'm waiting for someone.
Ha ha! Yeah right, white boy! Ha Ha ha.  I think maybe I drank too much.
Ahh! Jesus! You're burning hot! What the hell -
Thanks for the lovely evening, shithead!
Hey, you can't kick me! You're an apparition!
Oh fuck, you are his nephew...
You have to be a hero. All Americans think they are cowboys.
Fan-fucking-tastic?
Shit! You bought enough pate for a fucking army!
No, I don't think so... I was having a nightmare. Wait a second...
I'm not alright. We both know that. The only reason I'm here now is to warn you. You're still in danger. Gaston told me that Claude has got the curse too. He's a werewolf.
Because, Andy. It's a cure.
What makes you so sure this will work?
I saw him. Just before those bastards zapped him back. The ADM is in the wine cellar, in a bottle of Chateau Margaux.
What the fuck!? You too!?
I hope they fucking fry us all.
Holy mother of God...
GET ME THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!!
Okay, what the hell are you up to?
Pull over! Now!
It's you. You should be dead in that wreck with Bazin and Racine!
In Paris we have an expression for people like you: Enculé d'Americain.
The ADM. Let's go.
So, if you and the nutty professor are both werewolves, what do you want with drugs? You like seeing lots of pretty colors when you're tearing people's throats out?
Do you think I'm an idiot?
Andy...
Not you too -
You're exactly right, Andy. I enlisted both Serafine and your uncle to obtain ADM. And now I'm counting on your assistance too.
Great. Later on we'll have to get together for cocktails. Right now I kinda have to hurry before I grow a lot of hair and eat people.  Say this heart thing works. What's it got to do with ADM?
Uncle Terrence.
All my life I've worked to unlock the power of the unconscious mind. Well this is it. This is power!
Jesus...
Not that I know.
I'm afraid she's not so lucky. She's undead. And so am I.
Okay. So he's weird. Maybe on drugs. Still, that's not -
I need two tactical assault squads at Place Denfert immediately. You can tell the commissioner it's a code red.
Merde.
Twelve thirty-six a.m. here. Twelve forty a.m. here. There's two of them. At least.
Two more nights in this lunar cycle.
You better follow that McDermott kid. He's going to wind up like his uncle if he's not careful.
What were you showing her?
Hurry, Grandmama!
Who did you hear it from?
Noooo....
Poor Meetoo!
Fortunately, I am to be married.  With your highness, permission.
AND A SONG SOMEONE SINGS ONCE UPON A DECEMBER.
I don't know - I don't remember anything that happened before the revolution. . .
I don't know.  I don't see what this has to do with me.
You never thought of the possibility?
Do you always punch people first thing in the morning?
By pulling my hair?!
Come on!
You never said anything to me about having to prove I'm a Princess!
Dmitri?
Dmitri didn't want the money?
Hey, she's just a kid. And she's going to Paris outta sight, outta mind, outta Russia.
Boy, don't you hate it when that happens?
Well, she certainly has a mind of her own.
What do we do now?
What do you want?!
I need to speak with the Dowager Empress ...
I sent for you because I owe you a debt of gratitude larger than I can ever repay
You are the boy ...
Rasputin!  You're alive . . .
I'm... I'm, uh, I'm Robert Redford.
You're like New York. You're an island.
Excuse... excuse me, when do I go on?
What do you mean, next?
No, it can't be, because he's a comic.
So what are you telling me, you're putting on two comics in a row?
No, I'm sorry, I'm not goin'- I can't... I don't wanna go on after that comedian.
Lyndon Johnson?
I-I-I-I would leave out the men's- room attendant.
Bad mood? I'm standing with the cast of "The Godfather."
Oh, come on, we've seen it. I'm not in the mood to see a four-hour documentary on Nazis.
I missed my therapy. I overslept.
The alarm clock.
Alvy, now don't panic. Please.
Well, maybe we should just call the police. Dial nine-one-one, it's the lobster squad.
Oh, that's right. That you really like those New York girls.
Uh, well, you just said you were going downtown.
Oh - you're an actress.
Right!  Where?
No, no thanks. Hey, don't-
You're the worst driver I've ever seen in my life... that's including any place... the worst... Europe, United... any place... Asia.
Who? Grammy? Grammy Hall?
You're jo- Whatta yuh kid- What did you do, grow up in a Norman Rockwell painting?
Your grammy!
Well, who's Sadie?
Uh, narcolepsy.
Yeah, it's a great story, though, I mean, I... I... it really made my day. Hey, I think I should get outta here, you know, 'cause I think I'm imposing, you know...
Well, I mean, you don't have to, you know.
Well, didn't you take, uh... uh, a shower at the club?
Fifteen years, huh?
what I mean?
Oh, no-I mean, I'm just a-auditioning sort of at club. I don't-
Yeah.
I'm gonna have a corned beef.
No.
Here, you want some?
Yeah?
Yeah, 'cause I-I'm, you know, I'm, I'm obsessed with-with, uh, with death, I think. Big-
I've a very pessimistic view of life. You should know this about me if we're gonna go out, you know. I-I-I feel that life is-is divided up into the horrible and the miserable.
...you know, they're- The-the horrible would be like, uh, I don't know, terminal cases, you know?
You know what I mean? Like the tip o'your nose, and if I stroke your teeth or your kneecaps... you get excited.
You- Do you love me?
How- I don't want you to live with me? How- Whose idea was it?
Yeah.
You're so sure about it.
You followed me. I can't believe it!
"Existential Motifs in Russian Literature"! You're really close.
And I didn't have to lie down on the couch, Alvy, she had me sitting up. So I told her about-about the-the family and about my feelings toward men and about my relationship with my brother.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you. Because in the dream... I break Sinatra's glasses.
What?
Jesus. All right, gimme a magazine. I- 'cause I'm a little tired.  You know, you, you joke with-about me, you make fun of me, but I'm prepared for anything. An emergency, a tidal wave, an earthquake. Hey, what is this? What? Did you go to a rock concert?
What is this? What are you, since when do you read the "National Review"? What are you turning in to?
Very big spider.
Oh, I-I left it at your house.
Hey, what is this? You got black soap?
-me, my God, it's a great day!
Well, I had a really good day, you know that? It was just a real fine way to spend my birthday.
Remember, we had that thing.
Don't you remember we-we-we discussed that thing that we were-
The incredible thing about it is, I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed.
You never wanna try anything new, Alvy.
That's sick!
God.
God, it's so clean out here.
Don't you think his girl friend's beautiful?
Right. Geez, I feel like there's a great weight off my back. M'mmm.
You see, I-I've been thinking about it and I think that we should get married.
So whatta you... You're not gonna come back to New York?
I can't enjoy anything unless I... unless everybody is. I-you know, if one guy is starving someplace, that's... you know, I-I... it puts a crimp in my evening.  So wanna get married or what?
Okay.  Check, please. Can I -can I... Can I... Can I...
Oh!
This is my room.
I tell you this because, as an artist, I think you'll understand. Sometimes when I'm driving... on the road at night... I see two headlights coming toward me. Fast. I have this sudden impulse to turn the wheel quickly, head-on into the oncoming car. I can anticipate the explosion.  The sound of shattering glass. The... flames rising out of the flowing gasoline.
I'm so tired of spending evenings making fake insights with people who work for Dysentery.
Alvy, what is so fascinating about a group of pituitary cases trying to stuff the ball through a hoop?
Well, I can't li- We can't have this discussion all the time. The country makes me nervous. There's... You got crickets and it-it's quiet... there's no place to walk after dinner, and... uh, there's the screens with the dead moths behind them, and... uh, yuh got the-the Manson family possibly, yuh got Dick and Terry-
Hey, come on, it's quiet now. We can- we can start again.
Bad?
Tsch, a few.
Yes.
Oh.
Charlie Chaplin.
No, I'm not. We were walking off the tennis court, and you know, he was there and me and his wife, and he looked at her and then they both looked at me, and under his breath he said, "Jew."
Stop calling me Max.
No, I don't! You know, I was in a record store. Listen to this- so I know there's this big tall blond crew-cutted guy and he's lookin' at me in a funny way and smiling and he's saying, "Yes, we have a sale this week on Wagner." Wagner, Max, Wagner- so I know what he's really tryin' to tell me very significantly Wagner.
Forget it, Max.
Max, if we lived in California, we could play outdoors every day, in the sun.
I have some very good memories there.
Do you realize how immoral this all is?
You wanna lie down?
Visible panty line. Max, she is gorgeous.
Hey, you guys are wearin' white. It must be in the stars.
Imagine my surprise when I got your call, Max.
Let 'im drop dead! Who needs his business?!
Look at you, you-you're such a clown.
Heavy! Eaten by some squirrels.
I have to face facts. I-I adore Alvy, but our relationship doesn't seem to work anymore.
You can have it to use. Why-why are you smiling?
It could be freezing, it could be raining.
Did you see permits?  Did he have a license?
It's going.  It's going.
Any thoughts on casting yet?
You've got a lot of fucking gall.  Thirty nine.
Honey?
Oh.
I'll change back before we leave.
I'd love a Xanex.  Sally, please don't tell Sophia that I'm not breast feeding.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
You look so well, Clair.  A wraith.
What is that thing?
I told his father he'd be on that flight.
It's not a contest.
That for us?
It must be nice having so many strangers kiss your ass all of a sudden.
I saw Lucy when I was in London, she seems okay.  It's hard to tell with her.
In Cheyene Walk?  Lucy's going to have a meltdown.  Oh, I'm so sorry.
And?
Stupid tart.
You need to call your dad.
There's a test, you know.
Are you my big brave boy?  Are you my brave hero?
Oh yeah?
I call that a perfect day.
Just every once in a blue moon, you know.
Hey.  Thanks, buddy.
I suppose.  Sally, that's quite a gift. I'm not sure it's in your best interest.
I worry because you don't.  It's my job. I'm feeling guilty.  I would've liked it if you waited until the two of you were on more solid ground.
Scout's honor.
No.  Did you?
I missed all of you.  We're okay, aren't we?
Don't get it.
You want me to uninvite her?
Otis!  No barking!
Truce.
Someone left the goddamn gate open.  Otis got out.  Skye and I, well the... I came out of the house and the fucking gate was wide open.
She left the fucking gate open.
Otis, good boy, come here.  Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
I'm not sure we understand that word in the same way.
I don't look my age, Joe.
It's a shit novel anyway.
Not really.  I mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch.  That's what all our friends think, anyway.
Cal, too?
I had an abortion two weeks ago.
Yes.
No.
I know.
They're the keys to your grandad's flat. Happy anniversary, baby.
Yes I did.
Don't I find what?
Not long.
Do I put you off?
The infamous dog?
You got your DP?
And you got Skye Davidson.  Pretty big leagues for a first timer.  Do you even like movies?
Kind of.  Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're friends.  And great DP's I could give them a call for you.
Hey, I'm happy for you, buddy.  Anything I can do.
I'm a little nervous, so...
Are you okay?
I've never done this before.
Lemon or raspberry?
Yes.
He has to find non-smoker's meetings that used to be almost impossible, you know? It's gotten much better.
Nine...nine, yes?  Nine years, just about.
Yeah, well, it's just us and a few hundred of our closest friends.
I'm so happy you like it.  I'm so relieved you said yes, and I'm really, um, what, thrilled, yes actually, to finally meet you.
I didn't say a word.
I love it here.  Don't you love it here, Ryan?  I love it here.  And I love tonight.  And I love these people.  And this feels utterly fantastic, Ryan.  Utterly fantastic.
They're really nice people, Ryan. They're like us...
Are you making an ass of yourself?
I don't need a drug.
Ready to go?
Hi.  Monica and Ryan?
I...
Do you need anything else?
I'll tell you who doesn't know, cute girls don't know.
Are you lovesick?
I just wanted tonight to be with the people we love.
Like the last time.
Alright.  Well, that's something new.
Well, something's wrong.
We're going to have to go back out there.
Yes.
Thank you.  This was so unnecessary.  I hope you've noticed that Otis isn't barking as much.  We keep him in at night.
I trust you.
Well good.  Thank God.
Well, you weren't fine last summer when you went Sylvia Plath on me in Connecticut.
The squeaky wheel gets the oil.
Break's over.
You know, you're not just workers -- you can be whatever you want to be! Look at Z!  He started as a worker -- then he became a soldier!
So, um...how was your day?  What did you do?
The palace, hunh?  I bet those royals really live it up.  Of course they're all a little, you know, from inbreeding --
And you are...?
That's not what you said the <u>other</u> <u>night</u> --
I order you to find out where we are!
My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...I wish I'd never met you, you ruined my life.
Out here I'm just what?
So what makes you so special?
So we're going back for more armor, right?  I mean, these guys are from outer space, how are we supposed to beat them?!
BARBATUS!  You -- you saved my life!
Barbatus, hang on -- Barbatus!!
Fourteen-fifty hours, sir.
Good.  You're a good soldier.
Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush.
Royal victory party?  Will...will Princess Bala be there?
Well she better -- she's engaged to one.  <u>Me</u>!
Affirmative.
...Not enough food?
May I cut in?
Yes, what else?
...I should?
We declared war again?  Are you scared?
Get real, Z!  She just dropped the scarf by accident!
It's a sign that you're crazy!  Do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is?
You have to help me.  Please, Weaver. Think of all the things I've done for you!
You sure this is a good idea? DOBISCH Can't think of a better one.
You must eat -- and you must get healthy -- and you must forget him. Such a fine boy he seemed when he first moved in here -- clean and cut -- a regular Ivy Leaguer. Turns out he is King Farouk. Mit the drinking -- mit the cha cha -- mit the no napkins. A girl like you, for the rest of your life you want to cry in your noodle soup? Who needs it! You listen to me, you find yourself a nice, substantial man -- a widower maybe -- and settle down -- instead of nashing all those sleeping pills -- for what, for whom? -- for some Good Time Charlie?  Sssh!
Twenty-seven.
You're beginning to sound like Mr. Kirkeby already.
You mean tonight?
I wasn't trying to be personal -- it's just that the fellows in the office were -- whether you wondering about you ever --
This date -- is it just a date -- or is it something serious?
Well, as a matter of fact, I was rather hurt when you stood me up that night --
You couldn't help yourself. I mean, when you're having a drink with one man, you can't just suddenly walk out on him because you have another date with another man. You did the only decent thing.
Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I have quite a bit of influence in Personnel. You know Mr. Sheldrake?
Here.
What is it?
I didn't know -- I had no idea this was your apartment --
Who?
I didn't mean it that way -- I was just talking to him on the phone -- he's very concerned about you.
She doesn't seem to like you very much.
There's nothing here but a hundred dollar bill.
I am. Let me get the cards.
I was fifteen -- we used to go there to smoke. His name was George -- he threw me over for a drum majorette.
Too slow?
You better win a hand -- you're on a blitz.
Mr. Sheldrake? Oh, yes. Very.
What for?
Do I have to?
Now don't go getting any ideas, Miss Kubelik.
I would.
Well, maybe not exactly -- I tried to do it with a gun.
Worse than that -- she was the wife of my best friend -- and I was mad for her. But I knew it was hopeless -- so I decided to end it all. I went to a pawnshop and bought a forty-five automatic and drove up to Eden Park -- do you know Cincinnati?
No, thanks. The fellows in the office may get the wrong idea how I found out.
Say, you're pretty good with that racquet.
Oh, no. Sometimes I have dinner with Ed Sullivan, sometimes with Dinah Shore or Perry Como -- the other night I had dinner with Mae West -- of course, she was much younger then.  Cheers.
I mean, after that?
You don't have to if you don't want to --
How's everything at the apartment?
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lieberman -- and I'll never invite those people again.
And Mr. Kirkeby tells me that several nights a week you work late at the office -- without overtime.
What -- what's that got to do with me? I'm not running any bookie joint.
Oh.
How would you like to go tonight?
I made other plans. You can have both tickets.
It also says here -- that you are alert, astute, and quite imaginative --
This?
Oh -- terribly sorry. It's that cold --
Not that I have anything to hide.
Put me down for Thursday again.
You're not making sense, Baxter. What's this all about?
Yes, she's in the shower -- she's coming along fine, considering.
You're going to take her off my hands?
That's just one of the privileges that goes with this job. You also get a nice little expense account, the use of the executive washroom --  Say, what happened to you, Baxter?
Don't mind what?
Mr. Kirkeby, I don't like to complain -- but you were supposed to be out of here by eight.
You're on your way up, Buddy-boy. And you're practically out of liquor.
A lot of guys around here have tried it -- all kinds of approaches -- no dice.  What is she trying to prove?
That's okay, Buddy-boy.  Now like I was saying, I'm in this joint on Sixty-first -- and I think I got lucky --  -- she's a skater with the Ice Show --  -- and I thought maybe I could bring her up for a quiet drink.
Look, Baxter -- we're making out the monthly efficiency rating -- and I'm putting you in the top ten. Now you don't want to louse yourself up, do you?
Make it thirty minutes.  What do you say, Bud?
Let me worry about that.  Just leave the key under the mat and clear out.
You threatening me?
Okay, you made your point. We'll just have to do it next Wednesday -- that's the only night of the week I can get away.
Sometimes,  there's a twi-night double-header.  A nebbish like you!
You know, Baxter -- I'm doing some research at the Columbia Medical Center -- and I wonder if you could do us a favor?
There's a girl in my place -- she took some sleeping pills -- you better come quick -- I can't wake her up.
Want to tell me what happened?
So you went right out and picked yourself up another dame.
I'm not sure.
What's this -- you packing?
You know me with girls. Easy come, easy go. Goodbye, Doc.
You like Castro?  I mean -- how do you feel about Castro? BUD What is Castro?
What about him?
I see.  What do you think, Al? Can we help the man?
Dreyfuss.
Do you know who this is?  Look at him.
What for?
I don't know what you're talking about.
It's been hell.
Fran -- remember that last weekend we had?
Remember what we talked about?
If you'll just listen to me for a minute --
Where are we going, Jeff? Not back to that leaky boat --
How could I be so stupid? You'd think I would have learned by now -- when you're in love with a married man, you shouldn't wear mascara.
Coming?
I rented a car -- it's going to be here at one o'clock -- we're driving to Atlantic City.
I didn't plan it this way, Fran -- actually, it's all Baxter's fault.
He wouldn't give me the key to the apartment.
I'd appreciate it if you'd be out of here as soon as you can.
Maybe we should send up two flies -- and see if they'll propagate in orbit.
You came in on that boat, didn't you?
Oh -- I see -- Well, girls, this is Captain -- eh --
Look -- the girls could get killed -- we're not supposed to be this close combat, I mean real combat.
Look -- you know who that is, Captain -- you know what she's saying -- you'll never see stuff that good outside of a magazine for the rest of your life.
You're out of your skull --
We've been attacked.
I didn't know we had units up there in North Vietnam.
How long were you up there ?
So what happened ?
Chef.
Why they call you that?
A sauciere --
Captain -- they've been probed all this week -- Cong and NVA regulars. There's gonna be a big offense any time.
He killed that guy without feeling anything.
Elevate Lance, in the tree. No, I saw another.
All right with me, I used to drive a taxi.
I --
Why -- Charlie put it there to kill --
Will they attack?
I only met Kurtz once.
Touchy.
You got a chance in that boat -- by morning you could be five miles down the river.
Yeah.
Captain?
When I was a boy, my father would take me there, to hunt. There are a few savages, but no man can live there, no white man.
Lance Johnson? The surfer?
Mike, you know anything about the point at Vin Drip Drop?
What do you mean?
Eagle Thrust Four -- Big Duke Six. Join me in sparaying some trees.
Why the hell you wanna go up to Nu Mung Ba for?
Haiphong? Shit, you jump in ?
That village you're pointing at is kinda hairy.
Yeah, I can see that. He's fuckin nuts --
I think think a lie stinks.
You could never figure it because it doesn't make sense.
Going back  - to the jungle to die.
Men looked up to him...  He died as he lived...
He'll kill us.
Are you finished surfing?
No -- no, Captain.
Maybe we better stay in under the trees till dark -- we got his Yater.
You hear it again?
I'd just clear out as soon as I could if I were you, sir. They're gonna start working on the bridge with torches again. Charlie will start throwing it in hard --
What's a big question?
Did you know -- deeper in the jungle, upriver -- there are savages?
Are you warm, Captain?
So that's it.
What show ?
Hard to work up an interest in politics, way we live.  You're the first people we've seen in two weeks.
First you save my ass, now you want to kill me.  Make up your goddamn mind.
119  CONTINUED:  
26   CONTINUED:
Oh.
What about you -- why come back? Classy girl like you seems more suited to the finer things.
What about that hotheaded marshal, Sam Wilder?  I heard he was in the middle of this mess.
Stay here.
Great idea -- pointing a lousy dart gun at some nut with a high-powered hunting rifle.
I'll go into town with you.
Did you catch Corbett?
Was there any trouble?
I'll wear it for you.  And I can wear it when we go home.  We won't be here forever.
Look, why get into this again. As long as it's working, let's leave it alone.  It's been nice so far.  We're together --
Winter.  Two straight months of night -- we may never get out of bed.  Which would suit me fine.
Please, Anne Marie, you being here only complicates things.
Six months.  Ecological study for Northland Oil.
Been driving long?
Why in hell you care enough about me to die taking me in?
Still quite a hike to Devil's Cauldron.  Days.  A long stretch to go without sleep, my friend.  You can hide behind that pistol for now, but take your eyes off me long enough to sneeze --
We get wet, we freeze to death in a couple hours.
Be my guest.
Damn lucky this storm didn't blow down when we were on those baldheaded mountains.  It continues, we better stay put.
Where in hell Meyerling dig you up?
Killing wildlife not good enough anymore, so you go on to bigger and better things.
You were real resourceful out there.  Got me thinking of this perimeter man, froze all his fingers one winter.  So he hacked the tips off and sharpened the exposed bones.  Gets along better than ever.  Yeah, maybe I underestimated you.
Emergency transmitter?  What happened to signal mirrors or two-tone smoke fires?
Answer and I'll shoot!
Can you walk?
All this for laying traps on private land?
Christ if I shouldn't know better than to step in soft earth.  I've seen footprints in the tundra a hundred years old.
Sam, listen -- I shot to defend my man.  Other guy drew first.
Goddammit, I don't need this aggravation.  I'll shoot you, Ben.  Bank on it.
You don't mind me saying, Mr. Desmond, you look like hell.
-- Here?!  Where's Wilder?
If Corbett's men find out --
Look, Mr. Desmond, I didn't count on it turning this ugly.
Bastards killed Sam, you think they won't kill the rest of us?
Alleged killer.
You can't see past your lousy little assignment, sniffing around the pipeline.  The few voters there are in this district look up to Corbett, and I'm not about to alienate them.
Nobody wants any more killings; we all agree to that, correct?  That's good.  Now, Eric, you're gonna hand your prisoner over to us.
Wilder's missing church services; you believe it?
LeMalle.  We got a problem. Where's Mitchell?
I called the cops in Fairbanks, see when Ben is standing trial. They don't know shit about Ben or Wilder!
I ain't gonna leave a seven- hundred-dollar Remington behind.
Thought that door was open last night...
Meaning he'll need a plane.
Next plane's not coming 'til next Monday.
I didn't know you had a secret admire.
You're not still writing that thank-you note?
What is it you want? What?
How was it talking to him?
I'm sorry.
Do you love me?
Not your name...  what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?
How long has he been having problems?
They haven't done the standard scratch test. Where they make small injections into the skin?
Doc!!!  So listen, you gotta let me know about the additional costs -- one way or the other we'll...
I know. He's just the best.
The table's fine if it had some cholesterol on it. Two sausages, six bacon strips, fries, three eggs over easy and coffee.
Clippity clop -- clippity clop -- she has to pretend she doesn't hear me. Listening to the story from the upset friend...  now she drops off the cappuccino and smiles at the putzette who doesn't even say, "Thank you." No, the putzette wanted the whipped cream so back she goes and now she has to pass him again and it's getting tougher to make believe.
He's gotta fight to breathe. His asthma can just shoot off the charts -- he's allergic to dust and this is New York and his immune system bails on him when there's trouble so an ear infection...  Is this bothering you?
Sorry.
I'm hungry.  You've upset my whole day. I haven't eaten.
This is not a sexist thing. If you were a waiter I would still be here saying...
What about your mother?
Uh, Udall?
The doctors had your billing address. I'm sorry about the hour.
What needs clearing up?
So. Anything else?
Oh, I'm sorry... Didn't I say, "what?" I thought I said, "what?"... What?
My son.
Melvin, I'd rather not.
There's... there's no need to bring anything dressy... or... I mean -- I didn't know if we'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes.
Thanks, Melvin.
You don't owe me that.
How you doing?
The two might go together.
Okay to say something now?
Grouchy?
It feels a little confined here. Let's take a walk.
I don't know the last time I've been out of the city... Hey, my arms are tanning. I used to tan great. We gotta stop soon so'se I can check on Spencer.
Well...
I don't blame you... This is a monumental first day out... You sad or anything?
How to die, mostly.
That long neck -- the line of you... you're porcelain... your back goes on forever. You're classic... you're why cavemen chiseled on walls...
One night with me!
I love you...  Let him take you home.
I'm filling in. We don't know if she's coming back. She might have to get a job closer to home.
What the heck do you mean?
He's genuinely upsetting, isn't he?
How could you do that? He'll hurt him.
The medical bill are 61 thousand now. I've spoken to your parents and they didn't hang up or anything -- they just said they would feel strange calling you.
Okay. So you call 911 and don't leave your name -- even a dumb geezer should know that emergency automatically pulls up your name. How come you make a mistake like that?
My dog... you know... I mean my little dog with the adorable face... Don't you know what my dog looks like?
I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.
If you'll excuse me I'm not feeling so well.
Please, just leave.
Now we'll both call him.
I have never been so tired in my life. Okay, if I sit here?
I haven't been sleeping. I haven't been clear or felt like myself. I'm in trouble. Some son of a bitch is burning my bridges behind my back...  But the tiredness -- boy...  Not just sleepy.
I, uh... I was... attacked. Walked in on people robbing me. I was hospitalized. I almost died.
... Now he's going to want to stay. And they'll want to take a ride to the lake or whatever. So it's a good five hours back. It gives us a chance to take it easy and...
Did you like it that much?
Picking on me won't help.
Then get in your jammies and I'll read you a story... I think you've got a chance. The only real enemy you have is her ability to think logically -- the best thing you have going for you is your willingness to humiliate yourself if it gives you one chance in whatever -- so go catch her off- guard.
Why are you doing this?
Is there a problem?
Yeah.  Yeah, I'm a waiter.
Not too good at small talk, eh?
Yeah well, you just blew your tip, pal.
You understand what's going on?  It makes sense, right?
Game over, bitch!
I'm on the scent.
Such language in front of a lady.
No, the other Hotel Paraiso, in the city.  Near the Plaza del Sol.
How did he know?
Who is the mark?
I know what happened.
I give a fuck?  I'm done!  I quit! Do you fucking hear me!  I'm fucking gone!
Get on the expressway.
Took a guess.  Lucky for you, I guessed right.
An assassin?
Someone hired both of you?
And you want to use me to get him?
Forget it!
I'm two seconds away from making my choice which means you've got two seconds to tell me why I shouldn't shoot you.
Electra.
Because I'm done.
With computers.
Had?
I killed him.
Yes.  As soon as you get into this business, all you can think about is getting to the top.  That's all there is.  Until then, there is nothing.  You are nothing.
The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency.
They recruited me when I was in high school.
No, they didn't.
No.  Just the first one.
It.  Tell it.  For all I know it could be a machine.
Do you have a passport?
That's where he'll be.
No.
I'm kind of tired.  I think I'd like to try and get some sleep.
In Costa Blanca.
You should knock.
It's too late now.  Okay?  We'll have to deal with these.
Then, we wait.
If things go well, I don't have to. You'll already be in a rented car waiting for me.
I've been thinking about it for a long time.
What?
Yes.
What is it?  I don't like this at all.  What is going on here?
I don't believe that.
Ten years ago.
What did he want?
Do you have ulcers?
He told me that my curiosity became unnaturally entangled with my sense of self-preservation.
That's a ridiculous move.
Yes.
It happened to you before?
Martin.
I waited another four minutes.
Was nice.
He's coming, Electra!  Get out now!
I thought it was interesting --
I'll make my usual arrangements and expect my usual bonus.
Hi.  Did you call --
Is that all you want?
Hey, do you mind if I talk a little?  I feel like, I don't know, talking I guess.
I think I've heard of you.
Right.
Yeah.
Look at that.  I haven't watched the sun set in a million years. Do you mind?
Excellent, senor.  If you could follow me?
He_s the closest we've got to an intellectual.
Because it's in English?
You guys having a go a me or what?
What about that squat bar you showed me, is that open on a Sunday?
Good news comrades, it's better than we'd hoped. Lubosh filled me in on the legal side of squatting here and it's a piece of cake.
Well, providing we're treated like Czechs and we squat something that's not privately owned, we should be in the clear; at least DOUG  until they get an eviction order and bring in the bailiffs.
No, I got nothing till Tuesday.
I'll drill the locks and replace the barrels, that way it won't cost so much.
Tell them we're working for the University.
Well, don't get carried away.
Really, "The Freeman Centre"?
I've been saying that since we met.
Destroy the evidence huh.
Like helping a sick kid?
Let's split.
Afternoon!
No, not if you've got better things to do.
We'd better get some booze in for tonight.
Get me a couple of beers and a salami.
Thanks. Come on Chris, give me a hand.
My God! What happened?
Shit no, it'll be twice cost.
Does Jahn's thing have a name?
Huh?
I stopped by your office. Henry was steaming, he says he's going to throw you out of the window and that you never worked at the Bugler.
Well, the trial's in two weeks, but I think they've already sentenced me. They just need to check if Siberia can slot me in.
Yeah, somewhere?
And if you're wrong.
Doug, I can't just leave you!
If I cut a deal, I'm not staying in this country and I want Holly to come with me. So, if she doesn't come here today, you're going to have to get her to me tomorrow; after I call, promise?
Yeah, no problem.
I've been around.
We should be done by the weekend.
Why don't you read something after the break? DOUG What here? Weren't you listening to what I just said?
I'm not going in Doug. I'll wait for you here.
I hope you're going to invite me in?
She's tired.
I want you so bad. She'll be asleep soon, maybe we could do it quietly under the sheets.
I'll do my best. Is the place open.
About forty minutes.
It is okay........We will paint the wood black, yes?
You mean you don't know, Henry! We got a bunch of anarchists, controlling a six-level block of luxury apartments down on Janovska street here in the Old Town, and you don't know about it?
I'm in close with these guys, it isn't easy, but slowly they're opening up to me. Give me a month and I'll blow their movement wide open.
Will this thing take long?
We_re not all running away
Why don't we both forget about him?
Weren't you going to get some glasses?
Where did you steal the car?
And you broke into that room?
Enjoying our hospitality?
We'll have to see what more we can do for you, while you are still our guest.
Really!
You are playing a very dangerous game, I suggest you make it easy on yourself and tell me where they are.
What is it you want?
I'll need to make a phone call.
Central station, locker number 139 - combination JFK.
Shit Honey, you could've told me. People might think it's about us!
All I'm saying Honey is run the thing past me for Christ's sake before you get up and broadcast the crap.
Will you come home and forget all about him?
What are you an idiot!
Your father dropped off an extra check.
It could help with a new car --
You saw him?
To see your father?
That's eight years of school and training -- after college. And all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being.
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
I have no idea what to say. How to act. What if I do the wrong thing?
Everything's being done but it's not enough. I have to find something -- more.
Where is he? He's supposed to be here.
The address?!
Belinda's telling everyone that kiss was real.
I don't make small talk --
You don't know me.
Can't you have a normal conversation?
'I hope your dreams come true.'
This play -- ?
Fire is like a living thing. Wild. Unpredictable.
So what else is on this list?
Like you'd know.
I know. Don't say anything.
You think so.
Because I try to be nice to people?
What is that?
No.
The Bible. Why should I read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles.
The play's going to be really good.
All of it.
I don't want to be just your friend --
You don't either. Take a look at yourself. Maybe you're scared that someone might actually like you --
It's a start.
Hey.
Yes. But not as a date date.
It's only 7:30.
We can measure wind.
What do you actually know with religion?
I might do it wrong.
Assholes. This happen to you?
What's wr--?
So what do you want to see?
A Thermos of hot coffee. A blanket. Socks.
You're going to take a year off? Join the Peace Corps -- ?
I'm supposed to always be alone?
What's Landon Carter up to?
Apropos of nothing... so. So so so so --
We didn't tell him any different for years --
Landon. You go on home.
You've been well?
I'd gladly write you a letter of recommendation.
Listen you little Asshole, I oughta --
This... is the number one single?
Well, I was on my way to school, and I just wanted to stop by and see if you were feeling okay.  You seemed like you were in pretty bad shape the other night.
He comes out of the cafeteria line, he's nervous, he spills his corn, and he asks you to the dance!
Well, Eileen...jeez, that's hard for me to say. Have you ever been in a situation where -- well -- you know you have to act a certain way, but when you get there, you don't know if you can go through with it?
Is that what you were going to ask me, George? To go to the dance?
'Bike fine point?'
You're not picking a fight, you're coming to her rescue. Maybe we'd better go over the plan again. Where are you gonna be at 8:55?
Why what?
You know damn well that's not what I meant.
Who, me?
Oh -- right! Uh, Madison 3489.
Been any place unusual in the past twelve hours?
What?!
Did you ever consider that some doors are locked for a reason?
Eight thirty.
Exactly two minutes difference...  and it's still ticking!
All I know is you're throwing away an awful lot of money.
Professor, you time machine works! It works! It sent me back in time! I'm from 1982!
Jeez -- this is where you used to live, huh? You must have been rich!
You've convinced me that you must be who you say you are. No living human has ever seen this machine.  But why? Why even in my twilight years would I remotely consider sending someone back in time?
How did you know?
Professor. Well, not exactly, Professor. You see, we don't point it at the sun.
4200 rads...  That certainly can't be generated under controlled conditions in this day and age.
You answered the door!
I told you not to interfere with any of the events of this time! Nobody's supposed to see you here! What if I was a mailman? Or a salesman?
Where did you get this?
Apparently, what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mother's emotional behavior.
In a manner of speaking, yes. And because of that, she's no longer interested in your father.
That's just what I needed to hear.
There's no way of knowing.
You didn't?
Thanks for everything, Pro.
Sweet and what?  Maybe you'd better pay for this first.
Can you imagine your parents in bed together?
Me neither. I've always wondered whether they slept together before they got married. You think yours did?
Nah, skip that... I'm going to have to keep an eye on you, though.
I'll catch up with you.
That your spider in there? In that bottle?
You ever held another job before?
What kind of work do you think you would be qualified for?
Oh yeah?
Kit... Kit, I've got a question for you.
Then why'd you do it?
Well, Kit...
Good luck to you.
Sure is pretty.
Listen. I got a lot of respect for her, sir.  That's about as good a one as I know to tell you.
Jack.
Well, I was just messing around over there, thought I'd come over and say hello to you.  I'll try anything once.  What's your name? I said mine.
Just seemed like the right move... Whatcha doing?
You're a redhead.
Can I come around and see you tomorrow?
And the flowers... Let's not pick them. They're so nice.
Somebody else is going to get it.
That we should crunch our hands with this stone. That way we'd never forget what happened today.
I can look and see.
Listen, maybe we ought to tell somebody about this.
What'd you put him in there for?
I'd like to get out of here.
Maybe we should've tried to hop it.
Have you got a better idea?
Good deal... Oh, uh, we're on the run and we'd like to hang out here for a while. Couple of hours, maybe. How'd that be?
Yes.
You're my friend, aren't you?
Okay, friend. Start running.
What?
Ever since that phony phone call from the President.  Look at this. What is it?
Antidote to what?  Whose disguises?
Go back to the bus and reroute the call.
We will, old fried, we will.
It wouldn't tell us the whole story until you got here.  It wasn't to talk to the head honcho.
Buckaroo--! Sorry--
All accounted for?  Where's Penny?
Pull up!  We did it!  Holy shit, we did it!  Pull up!
...but he wasn't the real Doctor Lizardo...just this arachtoid creep that stole the good doc's body the year before in the Eighth Dimension when Prof. Hikita's lab exploded...
Where're you goin'?
Go away.  Let me rot?
Was she pretty?
I'd turn around, but I'm afraid you'd strangle me.
Open up or I'll shoot it off.
She must've been a bigger fool than me if she ran out on a guy like you...
You've got your six guns strapped on.  You're ridding off on another adventure?  Oh, my God, it's all real...it really is real.  I should go with you.  Please...
I'm not worth it, Buckaroo! Forget me!
World Watch One.  Direct incoming transmission.
Pictures don't lie.
So where's Buckaroo?
That's why I wear a fifty dollar hat.  Was a two hundred dollar hat, I hadda kill you.
Now twenty seconds downrange...Perfect Tommy, how on earth is Buckaroo able to keep that thing on the ground?
I'll be fine... Are you a writer, Mr Fink?
Perhaps the three of us, Mr. Fink.
No, sometimes he just... well, he thinks about Estelle. His wife still lives in Fayettesville. She's... disturbed.
If you could, I'd –
Hello, Barton.
Yes, I'm afraid I have.
Well... THIS.
Barton, I think we should concentrate on OUR little project-
...This'll sometimes help.
So now I'm s'posed to roll over like an ol' bitch dog gettin' ger belly scratched.
Chet!
...Hello.
I beg your pardon?
...Still, I must say. I haven't felt peace like this since the grand productive days. Don't you find it so, Barton? Ain't writin' peace?
...No, I've always found that writing comes from a great inner pain. Maybe it's a pain that comes from a realization that one must do something for one's fellow man – to help somehow to ease his suffering.  Maybe it's a personal pain. At any rate, I don't believe good work is possible without it.
What's that?
I'm sorry, I just feel like –I know I shouldn't ask, I just need some kind of help, I just, I have a deadline tomorrow-
Goddamn voices... DROWN 'EM!
Souse! Souse! He manages to write his name on the back of his paycheck every week!
I don't understand-
What do you do far a living?
Barton? What time is it? Are you all right?
Go ahead, son.
Well, I'm... glad to hear that –
...That's fine.
Neighbor, I'd feel better about the damned inconvenience if you'd let me buy you a drink.
... You got a glass? It's the least I can do.
What kind of scribbler are you – newspaperman did you say?
Well ain't that a kick in the head!
And that's the point, that we all have stories. The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. It's the stuff of life – why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater?  Goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? Don't call it new theater, Charlie; call it real theater. Call it our theater.
Exactly, Charlie! You understand what I'm saying – a lot more than some of these literary types. Because you're a real man!
Jesus, I hope I'm not interrupting you again. I heard you walking around in here.  Figured I'd drop by.
Ah, doctors. What's he gonna tell me?  Can't trade my head in for a new one.
...It was taken by one of my policy holders. They're more than just customers to me, Barton.  They really appreciate what I have to offer them. Ya see, her hubby was out of town at the time –
...This must be boring you.
Because that would mean they gave you mine.
Why don't we go to your room-
Hold on. I said hold on, so hold on.
...Uh-huh... Where's Audrey?
Jesus... You're leaving.
Jesus, Charlie, I...
...Don't look at me like that, neighbor.  It's just me – Charlie.
But Charlie – why me? Why –
Never heard of it. Let's move him to the Grand, or the Wilshire, or hell, he can stay at my place.
...It's a tenement building. On the Lower East Side...
...Can I be honest, Mr. Lipnik?
I – Mr. Lipnik –
No no, Mr. Breeze has actually been a great help –
...I was commissioned yesterday in the Army Reserve. Henry Morgenthau arranged it. He's a dear friend.
...Yeah, he... he lives next door to me.
Sex?! He's a MAN! We WRESTLED!
Got a couple questions to ask ya.
Started in Kansas City. Couple of housewives.
Well, some of his throat was there.
Sixth floor too high for you, Fink?
Why's it so goddamn hot out here?
We got a call from Berkeley P.D. There was a killing.  A professor. Icepick.  In his bed.  Multiple stab wounds.  1977.
How are you, Nick?
How about the coke?
What was she like?
Catherine Tramell.
I need a cigarette.
What are you talking about, Nick -- what's wrong with you?
How do you know Catherine Tramell saw my reports?
She must really be something.  From a clinical point of view.
What is your problem?  I'm trying to help you.  Why won't you let me help you?
What are you doing here?
Put your fucking hands up!  Don't move.
Did you leave the club with him?
Did you go home with him?
Was there anyone with you last night?
Yes, you do.
I told them you wouldn't want to hide.
But you didn't hurt --
Sure.
You tell me.
Tell me about Professor Goldstein.
What happened, Nick?  Did you get sucked into it? Did you like it too much?
I didn't.
Ice?
Why does he do it?
How's your shoulder?
Are you kidding?  You think this is my idea of morning-after conversation?
I thought that business with the scarf was pretty nifty.
Maybe she got jealous of Johnny Boz, too.
I thought you didn't do adolescent secrets.
You won't believe me.
I'd read about your shootings in the papers.  I decided to write a book about a detective.  I wanted to know my character.
You like to hang out with murderers or what?  Did you know Roxy --
You still think I kill people, don't you?
How'd you get in here?
No thanks.
Why?
There is no smoking in this building, Ms. Tramell.
Did you ever tie him up?
How did he die?
You have the right to an attorney.
The answer is no.  I didn't kill him.
He was walking home from work. They only lived a coupla blocks from the clinic.  Somebody drove by and shot him.
Yeah, he said it was routine too. Now it's two guys saying it's routine.
Ain't you go nothin' better to do than to come in here and jack off the damn machine?
You think I --
I don't think it's funny.
Easy there, partner -- I wasn't there.
You know that stuff they say about how you can judge people by their friends?
I'm not sure anymore she did it.
Where the hell you goin'?
He ain't that way.  He's got heart.
You're already gettin' psychological input, son.
When was the last time you saw John Boz?
Keep your three o'clock.
Are you kidding me?
I love it.  She's got a hundred million bucks.  She fucks fighters and rock and roll stars.  And she's got a degree in screwing with peoples' heads.
What is all this "Nick" stuff -- Nick would you like a cigarette. Nick can you give me a ride.
Fuck you, Phil.
You're driving around North Beach for no particular reason and this car won't get out of the way --
She's got enough money to burn this whole department down.
Why do you think he's dead?
Yes I did.
He died -- about five or six years ago.
Saddle River, New York!
New York.
Yeah – I'd do that... You could teach me.
Piss painting?
How come you're not peeing on them yourself?
B.B. It's me – Jean! What's the matter? No snow in Switzerland this year?
Jean Michel... Crawling from the wreckage?
... Can you... decipher this for us?
Hmmm. And 'Parasites.'  You seem to be a Primal Expressionist.
I use a lot of colors – not only black.
OK. One last thing. Is there any anger in you? Any anger in your work?
Yeah.
Blue? Where?
Who am I?
I knew I left these somewhere. One of these'll send your kids to college someday.  Here – I made this for you.
Famous people are usually pretty stupid. You're too smart. You'd get bored to death. You don't wanna be like John Henry – fighting the machine. Just do what you do. It's about integrity. Follow your heart.
What're you doing? You're doing something.
Good.
What's your fuckin' problem? You get a girlfriend and a little attention and then start acting all uppity with me.
No, don't tell me – you just got fired by your crazy boss.
You do! You definitely do.
It's not Sunday? I missed you. You shouldn't leave me alone.
Oahu, Lanai, Niihau, Kahoolawee –
It looks done.
... babies.
Hi.
You did it! You made it. I'm a painter, too.
Hi.
Come on.
What? Wait a minute... talk to me.
You see? You have someone to live for.
Singing on stage and painting in your spare time.
Hey, Rene.
Uh-oh!
Man, I was up on him years ago on the IRT.
'Fraid I can't.  There's been a kidnapping ... Tell Selina ... Ms. Kyle ... that some business came up -- no, tell her some major deal fell through, she'll feel sorry ... No, no, here's what to do, just tell her ... let her know that I ... not in a dumb "Be my girlfriend way," but --
Ah.  "Who", may I ask, are you going "as"?
Where's the fire?
How could you?  I'm a woman...
You're the second man who killed me this week.  But hey, no prob ... I've got seven lives left.
Sorry.  I mistook me for somebody else.
I don't see how ... Anyway, it's a treat to find you out in the world, away from Ebeneezer Shreck.
You've got a dark side, Selina Kyle.
Well, I'm... braver at night, if that's what you mean...
Well?  Was "Vicki" right?  About your difficulty with duality?
It's the so-called "normal" guys who always let you down.  Sickos never scare me.  At least they're commited.
I, ah ... never fool around on the first date.
There's a big, comfy California King over in Bedding.  What say we ...
A kiss under the mistletoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
... What do we do?
Hmm.  Primitive ventilation.
"Oswald" is linked to the Red Triangle Gang.  I can't prove it but we both know it's true.
Selina!  Selina Kyle!?  You're fired!  And Bruce -- Bruce Wayne! Why are you dressed up as Batman?
You killed me, Batman killed me, Penguin killed me.  Three lives down.  Got enough bullets to finish me off?
I'll warm ya!  I got hot mitts --!
Are you perchance a registered voter?  I'm also a mayoral prospect.
I oughta have you spayed!  You sent out all the signals!
Yes.  <u>Yes</u>.  Boyfriend trouble ..?
You buy this "blurry" business?
... eight, seven...
Actually this is all just a bad dream.  You're home in bed. Heavily sedated, resting comfortably, and dying from the carcinogens you've personally spewed in a lifetime of profiteering. Tragic irony or poetic justice? You tell me.
Most of all, I want to find out who I am.  By finding my parents. Learning my "human" name.  Simple stuff that the good people of Gotham take for granted.
You know what, Mr. ... Penguin-Sir? I think perhaps I could help orchestrate a little welcome-home scenario for you.  And once we're both back home, perhaps we can help each other out ...
Wonder if it's worth my time.
A platform?  Lemme see ... Stop global warming.  Start global cooling.  Make the world a colder place.  <u>Frigid</u> ...
Max!  Relax!  Josh and Jen'll put a spin on this.  We'll talk it over tonight, at your costume par--
Why, how industrious.  And how did you open protected files, may I ask?
... Where did curiosity get the cat?
And a very, very good one.
It's our secret.  Honest.  How can you be so mean to someone so meaningless?
Okay, go ahead.  Intimidate me, bully me if it makes you feel big.  I mean, it's not like you can just kill me.
Joanna and I were in love in London. But when I realized our age difference was too extreme -
You certainly will not.
He's over-eager, impulsive.  I can't trust him not to get hurt.
Oh, but, sir.  So much goes on-
But I can't can I?
Have you ever regretted your life working here, Alfred?
It's good to see you.
First Ivy had an intoxicating effect on both Dick and me.  Tonight my feelings spread to someone else.
Advanced botany.  DNA splicing. Recombinant animal plant patterns. Pheromone extractions.
Alfred, are you...?
Sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.
Crimefighter's rule number two.
Nice suit.  And today you are?
... A giant drilling truck burrowing under the city ...
She's definitely part of this.  It's weird, for a while Ivy was all I could think about.  But then...
No beauty...
Remember the victim at the airport. Toxins introduced through the mouth.
I guess we'll just have to kill her.
We cut our support.  A conflict of ideologies.  Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.
Forget the stars.  Look here, at the Earth, our mother, our womb.  She deserves our loyalty and protection. And yet you spoil her lands, poison her oceans, blacken her skies. You're killing her.
Who's Ivy?
Make a choice, Bruce.  Her or me.
That's gotta hurt.
What happened to his wife?
Absolutely.  Just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator.
That's no batlight, it's a birdcall.
You'd say anything to keep me away from her.  To keep her for yourself.
Impressive
No gun.  How disarming.
In my weakened state I am no match for the bat and the bird.
One kiss and you could lift the mask from his lifeless face.  Their secret identities would be revealed.  But how best to bait a brid?
What do we have here?  A lovely new supply of Venom.  I'll just take this to my laboratory for further study.
Join you?  I've spent my life trying to protect plants from extinction and now you corrupt my research into some maniacal scheme for world domination. When I get through you won't be able to get a job teaching high school chemistry, do you hear me, you psycho?
The dreams again, sir?
Gee, I'm not sure.  Alfred? How many rooms? Total?
Sorry to bother you, sir. I have some rather distressing news about Master Dick.
Actually, he took the car.
Could I let Batman go? For Dick. For me. Could I leave the shadows? Have a life. Friends. Family...
She's the first woman in a long time that's... No. She's the first woman ever. And she loves Batman. Not Bruce Wayne. If I let go of Batman I'll lose her.
Old habits die hard. Are you alright?
All the answers are numbers.
How about, MR. E.
May I help you, Master Grayson?
_Two_ million dollars waiting to be transferred from the _Second_ Bank of Gotham on the _22nd_ How could Harvey? _Two_-Face resist?
Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian.
Now black rubber.
I'm not the kind of guy who blends in at a family picnic.
Wait. I have a riddle for you.
No insights here, doc. Just trying to get comfortable on your couch.  Oops. Times up.
Look, I'd love to keep chatting-
In a sense we are all two people. The side we show in daylight. And that side we keep in shadow.
There's something I want to talk with you about. It's...Well, we.. I...
...Not the bat?
How about Richard Grayson, college student?
But what about all the good we can do? There are monsters out there. Gotham needs us.
It's Dr. Meridian. Chase. Do you remember me?
Why be brutalized by an uncaring world? My RES Box will give Joe Q Public a realm where he is king.  Not that someone like you would need it. Someone so intelligent. Witty. Charming. But for the lonely, the...
Yet so bright and chipper and conservative!  It's so you.  And yet so _you_!  Very few people are both a summer _and_ a winter. But you pull it off nicely.
Sure, E = MC squared. Until you factor in more than three dimensions. Then... Damn. Hit us again.
Go ahead. You can say it.
We want to dust him. We truly want to dust him bad.
Mr. Wayne is out for the day.
You know, we should've sat down and had us a little heart-to-heart. I bet we would have got on famously.
The Joker is a murderer. And you were as good as dead. So --
It doesn't protect your head, though.
They don't come down here. They're afraid of the lights.
No.
But it's not fair.  I'm half drunk and you're not even --
I'm sorry I had to stand you up today. I'd like to make it up to you.
Oh, Bruce. Don't tell me you carry it around with you.
Got it!
All right, Bruce, what do you suggest?
We got 'em!
Got it all figured, huh?  Grissom just sits back and hands you the reins.  -- Maybe he don't know what we know.
I dunno, man.  After what happened to Johnny Gobs - -
And what happens if we say no?
That's it?
All right, then. Here's the deal. Total amnesty... and the sum of ten million dollars, payable in --
Please! We'll talk. Just tell us what you expect.
I've seen worse.  Much worse.
... Why the mask?
Guess who's got a date with Bruce Wayne?
Plain or roasted?  Alex, I'm very flattered that you've gone out and done all this research.
Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this.
Not what?
Couldn't turn down the job, huh? A girl could get hurt this way.
And what did you say?
Well, they're kind of busy but it doesn't look like ...
There were three strawberries.
Ali?  What's wrong?
Yes.  And	I have a wine for dinner that will kill you.
He's not too bad.  I can live with him.
Goodnight Annie.
Seems to be a problem with the door. Where's the picture gone?
And howls Alison?
'Emergency measures, in your book means sack people right?
Lord Walton assures me this guy's one of the very top scholars in the English art world.  Has a couple of doctorates no less.
You're not going to ....
Thank you David.  However, flattery will get you nowhere.  Truth is, I have a rather different plan for Whistler's dear Mama.  Bernie and I have been inspecting our books - and the long and short of it is, we cannot survive with our current losses, so ...
David, David, David ...
Honey, calm down now... it's okay...
I wish I could use that at school.  "Hey, Teach, no hard feelings ... It's just things between us ain't what they used to be and I need a little space, ya know?  So I'11 see you around in a couple of years, maybe".
Come on Sting!
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
Actually, we just wanna watch TV...
We're gonna get paid to score.
Uh, B...A...U... No, uh, V...
Huh huh huh huh huh huh.
Me first.
This is it, Beavis. Huh huh. We're finally gonna score.
Damn, huh huh.
Dammit, all they have is shows about water.
That was boring. Huh huh.
This sucks. It's all hot and stuff.
Yeah, and um, he used to hit me too.
Hey Butt-Head, do you think we're ever gonna score?
Shut up, dill-hole.
Turd-burglar...
Bunghole...
I hope to score big there myself. I'm mostly going to be doing the slots.
I'm probably going to make out with her first before we, you know, get down...
We got nothing, Chief. We tore the place apart. We can only legally hold her for another couple of hours.
Talk ta me, Bork.
They look like a couple of kids chief.
Okay, boys and girls, our suspects are on a tour bus we believe to be headed for...  the White House! Jumpin' Jesus! I want everyone there. Our people. Locals. Orders are shoot to kill. Repeat! Shoot to kill!
Here she is. Her name's Dallas. She ain't as sweet as she looks. She stole everything from me. Ya gotta watch out, 'cause she'll do you twice as fast as you'd do her.
Uh, hey. One of you kids got a match?
Who sent ya?
Ten grand? That cheap-ass... I got a better deal for ya. I'll double it. I'll pay ya twenty if you go back there and do mah husband.
You saved my -- uh -- life... or whatever... something.
Handbook for the recently diseased.
Maybe this is heaven.
Just says 'won't.'  Wait a minute. Here it says 'the living are arrogant... they think they'll never die, so they refuse to see the dead.'
Yet another triumph for Adam and Barbara in the afterlife.
... Not what I expected when we walked through that door.
We'd like some help in getting rid of the people who moved in here.  Barbara and I worked very hard on this house.
I feel really stupid.
Here's something.
I guess we open it.
But <u>we</u> let him out.
You know, I've been thinking.  I could teach Lydia to sew.
What...?
We weren't there.  The handbook says funerals aren't for the dead.
So can I?
Okay.  But that Betelgeuse sure seemed mad.
I heard.  Tore your face right off!  Bad news.  It obviously doesn't do any good to pull your heads off in front of people if they can't see you.
<u>Don't say his name</u>!  Just practice. Do it <u>yourself</u>!
All right.  Who are you?
You lilly-livered bleeding hearts!
I'd nearly given up on you.  I was about to leave.  I do have other clients.
Yes.  I evaluate individual cases and determine if help is needed, deserved, and available.
No.
You could double the size of your hardware store!  You'll be rich.
That's right.  They treat you like scum I bet?
Minor problem.  The rules.  I can't tell it to you.  But... do you know how to play charades?
Beetle!
You were the snake!  Right?  I know.  I saw you.
No I don't.  I don't take orders from smurfs.
So... You're ready for me now?
It's <u>Otho</u>!
I can't believe that we're eating Cantonese.  Is there no Szechuan up here?  Hunan?
Otho'll know what to do.
Just don't tell Lydia.
I was just trying to open the door.  Mrs. Butterfield brought over a skeleton key.
Skeleton keys never work.  Anyway, this can wait.  We'll get a crowbar later.  Your mother...
What?
Look at all that <u>parking</u>!
Not <u>a building</u>!  That's the beauty of it.  I think I can buy the <u>whole town</u>.  These people don't know the value of their property!
Lydia tried to play a most amusing joke on me this afternoon.
Blue-green!  Hydrated chromic oxide!  Remember I'm schooled in chemistry.  I was a hair analyst! Briefly.  Interior design is a <u>science</u>, Delia!  Think of me as Doctor Otho.  And this patient is truly <u>sick</u>!
Is there much more of this torture?
It does indicate a marvelously urbane sense of humor on the part of these ghosts -- that they actually appear in <u>sheets</u>!
Look at that <u>detail</u>!
Are they still here, Otho?
What's happening to them?
<u>Adam</u>!  <u>Adam</u>!
I swear, Chauncey, between you and Benjamin, I've got my hands full...  ... Say, that is coming along, the swelling has gone down considerably...  ... Any pain here?
He does, does he?
... It's five of, you'd best get on in there.
And you, Benjamin, must be strong and brave for me. Turn over, please.
Good God, Eve - you'll freeze out here.
Not necessary, but preferable. I don't think he'll be a bother, he seems like a most refreshing sort of man.
How true. Mr. Gardiner may be a welcome change of pace.
At times, yes. But that's not an uncommon reaction to such an accident. Actually, I found him to have quite a sense of humor.
We have to find him, Robert - he could be lost, something may have happened, we can't leave him!
I do - we do - both of us, Ben and I feel so much for Chauncey...
Well, he said it was his, he walked us through it.
Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening' just called.
Fine. They felt that since you had such close ties with the President, you would be a splendid choice.  ... Can I help you? Are you looking for something?
I hope you're comfortable.
... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better?
May I ask your name?
Won't your injury prevent you from attending to business, Mr. Gardiner?
... Would you like us to notify anyone for you?
Oh, I know exactly what you mean. I sometimes enjoy puttering around myself, such a pleasant way to forget one's troubles.
Chauncey!
Oh, I like that very much.
... Good night, Chauncey.
Chauncey! Have you seen the papers?
... You know, Chauncey... I want us to be...  I want us... You and I to become... close... I want us to become very close, you know...?
... Is that all you want...?  ... To watch me...?
Chauncey! Chauncey!
Oh, Chauncey, darling... Where have you been? We thought we'd lost you - we've been looking all over!
I see. Then one more quick question, Mr. Gardiner; since we at the Post would like to, uh - update our profile on you - what exactly is your business?
Do you realize, Mr. Gardiner, that more people will be watching you tonight than all those who have seen theater plays in the last forty years?
Regretfully, Mrs. Rand - I shall yield the pleasure of your company to others.
... Mr. Gardiner, I wish to be quite candid - considering the gravity of your economic situation, shouldn't we, the diplomats, and you, the businessman - get together more often?
Yes. Tell me, Mr. Gardiner - do you by any chance enjoy Krylov's fables? I ask this because there is something... there is something Krylovian about you.
... You will join us for dinner, won't you, Mr. Gardiner?
Do we have a garden? Hah! Tomorrow, Chauncey, you will see our gardens.
A gardener! Well put, Chauncey excellent! Isn't that what a businessman is? A gardener? A person that makes flinty soil productive with the labor of his own hands, who waters it with the sweat from his own brow, and who creates a place of value for his family and community? Yes, Chauncey, what a brilliant metaphor -- yes, indeed, a productive businessman is a laborer in his own vineyard.
Chauncey, up and around this morning, are you?
Well, that's good news, my boy.
Yes, when I was younger I had thoughts about public office... But I found, Chauncey - that I was able to contribute more as a private citizen... of course, my wealth provided me with considerable influence, but I've tried, believe me, not to misuse that power... It's extremely important, Chauncey, when one is in a position of eminence, that he does not allow himself to become blinded to the needs of the country... The temptations are strong, and I've been labeled a 'kingmaker' by many, but I have tried to stay open to voices of the people... I have tried to remain honest to myself...
And, please, Chauncey - don't rush your decision. I know you're not a man to act on the spur of the moment.
Certainly, Ben.
Mr. Gardiner, my editors and I have been wondering if you'd consider writing a book for us? Something on your political philosophy. What do you say?
May I help you, Mr. Gardiner?
... Then you really are a gardener?
This is terrible, sir -  I hope you're not badly injured...
I don't think we should call anyone just yet, it may not even be all that serious.
Come now, Mr. Gardiner, before his speech at the Financial Institute the President consulted with you and Benjamin Rand, did he not?
Well, let me rephrase the question; the President compared the economy of this country to a garden, and stated that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow. Do you go along with this belief?
Don't we need a leader capable of guiding us through the seasons? The bad as well as the good?
Well, Mr. Gardiner, from the sound of our audience, I'd say that your words are a most welcome respite from what we've been hearing from others...
... You've quite a sense of humor, Mr. Chance - but all kidding aside, may I ask just what you are doing here?
1952...?
Have you served in the Army?
Those trees were very young when I first arrived.
I have no claim, Thomas.
You look much taller on television, Mr. President.
... In the garden?
... Gardiner is laconic, matter-of fact. The scuttlebutt is that he's a strong candidate for one of the vacant seats on the board of First American. But before we can do any sort of a piece on the man, we're going to need facts on his background...  ... Kinney, what did you come up with?
Sure, try again - where? There's nothing, it's like he never existed!
Sid, it's useless!
You heard?
I shall take the gentleman to the third floor guest suite, ma'am. Dr. Allenby is standing by.
Come on, Eve. Let's let the men talk, there are so many people that have been asking about you.
... Yeah...
Good night.
But... Where was this man Gardiner before last week?
Hmmm... Take this down.  I want this quote included in the Tass coverage; 'Chauncey Gardiner, in an intimate discussion with Ambassador Skrapinov, noted that "Unless the leaders of the opposing political systems move the chairs on which they sit closer to each other, all of their seats will be pulled from under them by rapid social and political changes."'
What the hell are you talking about, Kaufman?
I'd like to hear that data, Kaufman.
But we are quite certain, comrade, that this man Gardiner is a leading member of an American elitist faction planning a coup d'etat.
No, she flew up to Boston for another charity event. She'll be sorry to have missed you.
You're right, Mr. President I don't like feeling sorry for myself.
John! Great to see you! Sorry about the cunt at reception.
Malkovich.
Enjoy.
What?
Isn't that cute? I just taught her that.
Seven-ish
They'll understand. Besides I've got a morning appointment tomorrow with Elijah's shrink. We're getting to the bottom of this acid stomach.
Hi.
The iguana.
I'll meet you on the turnpike.
I have to go back now.
Why?
So how was it? What was he doing?
You see, men can feel unfulfilled, too. I'm glad you're realizing that. You shouldn't be so quick to assume that switching bodies would be the answer to all your problems.
I don't know. There's some tension between us. I'd hate to expose you to that.
I'm getting rid of the fucking animals.
I'm getting rid of the animals. I've lost interest. Besides, they're standing between you and me.
You were him last night, weren't you?
We?
I'm your Goddamn wife. Once you vowed to cherish me forever. Now you hold a gun to my head?
Tell her, what the hell, close early today, live dangerously.
You fell in love with her first.
I need a shower.
You saw it once. Now you see it again. That's life, isn't it? And you were up here to try the same thing, weren't you?
Sure, after a fashion.
She's not my secretary. She's what they call an executive liaison, and I'm not banging her, if that's what you’re implying.
I don't want to be your godamn link, damn you. I want to feel Floris' naked thighs against my own. I want to know passion. I want my body to inspire lust in that beautiful, complex woman. I want her to shiver in a spasm of ecstasy when I penetrate her. Oh, God, the agony of the flesh, Schwartz.
Dr. Lester, I have a question. I was in that vacant office down the hall and I stumbled upon a little door and....
No thank you sir. It's delicious, though. I just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to work at LesterCorp, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to tender my resignation effectively immediately.
Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp.
Made it. Maxine. Maxine, Maxine, Maxine.
It's just, and I've never done this before, Maxine, but it's just that I feel something for you. I've never felt this before for anyone, not even my wife. My future is with you, Maxine.
This is important!
Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.
But there's something profound here, Maxine, we can't exploit it.
Really?  But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence!
Okay. Here it is.  Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding. Only two hundred dollars for fifteen minutes. Visit J.M. Inc., Mertin-Flemmer Building. etc., etc.
You've got to tell Craig what's going on. He must never leave Malkovich.
No. Don't be an ass.
Boy, this is a toughie. To be honest, I didn't anticipate this.
Impressions? Those are hard.
No, a sexy dream. Of course, a scary dream.
Oh, he's good! Great, actually. I saw him do "Tru" with his sixty foot Robert Morse puppet. Sensational.
I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me the plan.
Can you do that? I mean, do you know anything about puppetry?
I was just asking. No disrespect intended.
Fine. I mean, it's not like I was doubting you, it's just that I know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire.
Thank you, Floris.
Says me. Do you dream often?
It's like nothing I've ever felt before. I think I'm going crazy.
I'm done with her now. Tonight really creeped me out.
No! Don't harm the vessel!
I'm not certain, my dear, but I believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route.
We have to meet.
Maxine! Listen:  It hasn't been me in John the last three times. Craig's had me locked up in the apartment. He made me call you at gunpoint. It's been him! Oh, God, it's been him!
Yeah, I saw them
She's not available.
Never heard of it.
Sounds boring. Are there any songs?
I'm not afraid. I toured for a year with the National Puppet Company's production of "Long Day's Journey Into Night."
How'd you get this number?
Thanks so much for coming over.
So, do you enjoy being an actor?
Come on in.
You still there, sweets?
Doesn't he know how important tonight is to us?
Sleepy suddenly.
Good-bye, Maxine.
This Saturday - you coming to Call or what?
Then what? When you get through with blue and yellow, then what?
You saying God give up? Nothing left for us but pour out our own blood?
You can't do that, Baby. It ain't right.
Oh, I remember bits and pieces of all of'em I guess..Halle, of course..I had Halle a lifetime. Almost twenty years... My two girls, sold and gone before I could even a heard about it, and them without their grown up teeth yet. My third child, my son after Halle...I let that straw boss have me for four months so's I could keep that boy. Next year, he had him traded for lumber anyway and me pregnant with his child. I couldn't love that child. I wouldn't. Not any of the rest either. God take what He would....and He did...
..I swallowed her blood right along with my mother's milk. She played with me and always came to be with me whenever I needed her. Me and her waited for our daddy. I love her. I do. She never hurt me. I love my mother but I know she killed one of her own, and tender as she is with me, I'm scared of her because of it. All the time, I'm afraid the thing that happened that made it all right to kill her own, could happen again. Whatever it is, it comes from outside this house, outside the yard. So I never leave this house and I watch over the yard so it can't happen again ... I have to keep it away from my sister...I'll protect Beloved...'Cause She's mine...
YOU NEVER FORGOT ME?
WILL YOU STAY?
You don't sit with me!!
Well, is it now? How you getting along?
She gone like they say?
And Paul D...you don't have to stay 'way, but be careful how you talk to my mama, hear?
What you want?
They getting older now and I can't take care of 'em like I used to. More and more they keep asking me to sleep over night. Now, I don't want to quit these people but they can't have all my days and nights too. I got my own family needs me. It'll take some convincing but maybe you could come after supper - take care of your mama during the day, then earn a little something at night, how's that?
DON'T LOVE HER TOO MUCH.
Mama let me help you.
No...no...no..
Out where?
Why? Why he have to ask? Can't nobody offer? What's going on? Since when a black man come to town have to sleep in the cellar like a dog?!
It's her, ain't it?
What run him off? Tell me that!
You?
He knew Baby Suggs?
You pick any house, any house where colored live. Pick any one and you welcome to stay there. I'm apologizing 'cause they didn't offer to tell you. But you welcome anywhere you want to be. My house. John and Ella. Miss Lady Jones..anybody. You choose. You ain't got to sleep in no cellar and I apologize for each and every night.
I said I had two things to say to you. I only told you one. I have to tell you the other.
Leave off..
Tell me something, Stamp. Tell me this one thing. How much is a nigger supposed to take?
No, You looking good.
She comes in the daytime.  She still with me, my Denver.
What, baby?
Hey!!
This is our concern, Dude.
I know my rights.
This is a hundred and eighty dollars.
What the fuck is he talking about?
What do you mean, Dude?
Where you going, Dude?
Your phone's ringing, Dude.
Almost five!
What tied the room together, Dude?
How come you don't roll on Saturday, Walter?
Who has your undies, Walter?
That is indeed Mr. Lebowski with the first lady, yes, taken when--
Papers.  Just papers.  You know, my papers.  Business papers.
...Me, I don't drink coffee.  But it's nice when they offer.
Thanks, Gary...Take care, man, I gotta get back.
People forget that the brain is the biggest erogenous zone--
Of course, there's that to discuss. Refill?
Who the fuck are you, man!  Come on, man!
Hello, gentlemen.  You are the bereaved?
Right, but let me explain something about that rug--
Excuse me?
I was talking about my rug.
Yeah, but my-
Oh that's okay, I hardly even--
From who?
Dieter Hauff?
Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?
Jeez.  I miss vinyl.
Well...yeah--
I was, uh, one of the authors of the Port Huron Statement.--The original Port Huron Statement.
Increases?
Well...no, of course not--
So...that doctor.
No, the, uh, police chief of Malibu. A real reactionary. . . So your father. . . Oh man, I get it!
This was, uh--
What's your point, Walter?
What the fuck are you talking about?! This Chinaman is not the issue!  I'm talking about drawing a line in the sand, Dude.  Across this line you do not, uh--and also, Dude, Chinaman is not the preferred, uh. . . Asian- American.  Please.
What the fuck are you--
Way to go, Dude.  If you will it, it is no dream.
Theodore Herzel.
Hey man--
Walter, you can't do that.  These guys're like me, they're pacificists. Smokey was a conscientious objector.
The fucking point is--
We can't do that, Dude.  That fucks up our plan.
Walter--
It's been stolen, Walter!  You fucking know it's been stolen!
You want a toe?  I can get you a toe, believe me.  There are ways, Dude.  You don't wanna know about it, believe me.
I'll  get  you  a  toe by  this afternoon--with nail  polish. These fucking amateurs.   They send us a toe, we're  supposed to  shit our- selves with fear.  Jesus Christ. My point is--
Well that's just, that's the stress talking, Dude.  So far we have what looks to me like a series of victimless crimes--
He lives in North Hollywood on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger--
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Uh.
It is a fucking emergency.
I'm saying if he knows I'm a fuck- up, then why does he still leave me in charge of getting back his wife? Because he fucking doesn't want her back, man!  He's had enough!  He no longer digs her!  It's all a show! But then, why didn't he give a shit about his million bucks?  I mean, he knew we didn't hand off his briefcase, but he never asked for it back.
His million bucks was never in it, man!  There was no money in that briefcase!  He was hoping they'd kill her!  You throw out a ringer for a ringer!
Shit yeah!
Yeah, and you were--
Walter, you fuck!
What's mine is mine.
Hy God!  They shot him, Walter!
You make everything a fucking travesty!
Yeah.
Huh?  No, she, she hit me right here.
Come on, man, I'm not trying to scam anybody here, I'm just--
No, look.  I do mind.  The Dude minds. This will not stand, ya know, this will not stand, man.  I mean, if your wife owes--
Ah fuck it.
Is it. . . is it, being prepared to do the right thing?  Whatever the price?  Isn't that what makes a man?
Yeah, but--
<i>You'll</i> take him.
He's all yours. And I'm not your partner.
What?
You've been training two years to take me out.  Here I am, the big, bad vampire hunter.  So do it.
Where to first?
What is it with you people and pain?
Which means he turned about seventy-two hours ago.
Blade.
Anyone else make it?
It would've been easy for you to let me die back there today, but you didn't.
What do you think?
You ask me, you and Miss Muffet are getting a mite too cozy for my taste.
What's your problem, Whistler?
And so will we.
Kiss your ass goodbye, Reinhardt.
Oh yeah?  Like how little?  In case you hadn't noticed, we lost two men while you were out farting around.
We want to attract them, not scare them off.
I would hate to think you were losing your perspective.  Who do you think God favors in the web?  The spider or the fly?
From his father, of course.
Yes?
Tell me something, Skid --
The hell are you fiddling with there?
Going on twenty years now.
Whistler!
Get in. You’re leaving.
It's not very effective in direct sunlight, but it's a start. The goal, of course, is to be like you, "the Day-walker".
I can't just leave. I have a life here, a career --
I can go to the police. I have blood samples back at the hospital. I can show them.
How did you know?
Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If they're loyal, if they prove themselves, then their masters will turn them.
What are you looking at?
Looks like we hit pay-dirt. This place is crawling with them.  See the valets over there? They're vampires. So is the doorman.
I can't close my eyes without hearing her scream.
Are you all right?
No --
Maybe it's time to start exploring other alternatives.
This isn't human blood.
Tell me something, honestly, you ever have second thoughts about us?
These archives are restricted to members of the House of Erebus.
How many of you are there?
I was wrong about you, Blade. You were never one of us. You're a traitor to your race.
Whistler!
Why didn't you tell me the truth about him?
Blade's unique, you know. A one in a billion anomaly. He can withstand sunlight, garlic, even silver. But he still has the Thirst.
Why do you hunt them?
How did you escape?
What happened to the power?
--or incredibly fucking naive.
'Give you a hand. I think my sleep for the night just ended.
Try, please, Anna--
--Jamie Kurth, Jonathan Edmunds--
Please! Please...? I haven't done anything.
Why are we here?
What's she look like?
Where they found the backpacks and all the film a year later.
No, the kids were actors, the townspeople were real. Her, the Sheriff, the Convenience Store guy--
No.
--chalked just hours ago by ancient adolescents. It's called vandalism.
--brother of Rustin Parr's maternal grandfather, somewhere after 1858--
Anna--
Was that you laughing?
What'd you dream?
The clothes--take 'em off-- I want to see every square inch--
Oh, Jesus, no--
--last thing I remember were those four clowns shooting the movie--
I don't think it was them.
Something happened to Anna in Burkittsville, in the woods, I don't know.
Can't you like just divine it?
I got a friend at a Lab. I could get the whole thing blown-up, enhanced--
From-the-movie-Mary-Brown, Trailer Park Bible Psycho?
Never would've guessed.
No fucking.
Made no sense. Scared out of their minds, and the greatest stress reliever in creation right at their fingertips. Nada.
Used to be a meat-packing plant. Slaughter on the ground floor-- carcasses schlepped up on this thing for dissection and grinding and--
English.
Whatta you got, telescopic vision?
Where's Domini?
--Cotter, where can I get on-line?
It's <u>freezing</u>.
Nobody's going anywhere--
Remember....what Mary Brown said-- she could see the witch's hands on my face, her mouth sucking on mine.
--they're from UMass, doing some kind of fucking term paper--
--Cotter--
We're not making Blair Witch II here.
Cotter?
Okay, but--
They're making "Blair Witch II," too.
--what happened to the goddamn "Witch-watch??"
Cotter, I think she's right. Why would those guys go to all the trouble of stealing the camera and all this other stuff and leave the tapes?
Running a junk yard.
There's four other angles, man, we haven't even--
What--
How much of that stuff you guys been smoking?
Just hold on!
Just let it go, I've got you!
--it's less than four feet, just--
Look at those marks--just like in the movie.
Someone want to tell me what's going on--
Women miscarry all the--
What'd you see?
Dad...?
No big deal. I'm just trying to understand.
You think....there could've been something up in those woods that Anna--
What?
Spare me.
I can't do it!
Put 'em together that's a "k." James Kurth--
Like a blueprint for disembowelment.
Then just give me one of your explanations that all three of us'll buy.
Could I tell him what it's regarding?
--yes, Ma'am, can I help you with anything else?--
I'll tell your mother not to expect you at the funeral.
Jesus, I got a hangover. Want a drink?
Don't go to the bar, Ray. I know him, that ain't a good idea.
Who was it?
I could've sworn I heard something.
...Well I'll be damned.
When you don't they're usually nice.
Ray?... What time is it?
Okay, see ya... Thanks, Ray.
...Where is everything?
Sure don't.
And how many room got TV, Dusty?
Well now you do.
Now that don't make much sense.
...Well, if the pay's right and it's legal I'll do it.
Dead, huh?
Something I got to ask you, Marty. I've been very very careful. Have you been very very careful?
No, he's off tonight. Where was he last night?
Is Marty here?
Got a problem, Meurice?
...and Abby. Maybe. But as far as I'm concerned that only leaves one fucking possibility.
Tuesday is ladies' night.
Jeffrey. you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
Doctor Gynde. my whole family's sick. What's going on?
Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
Anything you can tell me?
Okay. come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
Who knows you have these?
For now. Alright. you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. hurry. I'm in the apartment. hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon.  I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different.  He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.
Hello, baby.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?
What do you want from me?
Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want?
Don?
Thank you. honey.
You don't?
I liked being with you last night.
Yes. Frank-
There's no disease, I can tell you.
Dorothy. no!
I'll call you.
Oh no.
Where have you been?  Oh God. they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?
Hey? . You like to walk.
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes. pour the fuckin' beer.
Yeah, how did you know?
Oh yeah?
Yeah I did. treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
How is Central these days?
What do you know about the ear?. anything?
Come on. you brought it up. Do you know anything?
I guess you have to get back home soon?
Oh yeah. What about those other people? . Anything?
You said it was a strange world. and you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy.she is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
Now. we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window .alright?
You really want to do this, don't you?
What's the plan.
I. I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
What's with Mike?
You want to tell me about it?
Okay. okay.
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
You want to dance?
Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?
How ya doin' Dad?
I mean, for good, Jeffrey.
Can I use the car tonight?
Well.
Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!
I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame.
Would you like a piece of cake?
What are watchin' this junk for?
Come on out a minute, okay?
Ha ha.  That's too much, Georgie.  Those days are over.  The rate is one-thousand dollars.  Inflation, you know?
Just everything.  You.  California.  The beach.  This spot right here.  I feel like I belong here, you know?  It just feels right.
Are you sure this guy is cool?
Surprise.
George, I went to the doctor.  I don't have two years.
Hmm.  I see.  Will there be clothes in the suitcase?
Whose cloths?  Your clothes?
What can I do for you guys?
I know what you want.  But, first of all, are you cops?
I don't know...
What's that?
No?
Twenty-six months.
No, my brother.
That's over fifty-thousand dollars profit per kilo.
Diego Delgado, please?
Please, continue.
A million dollars for our first run is not bad, George.
George, good to see you, my brother.
Right.  Now who is the person in California?  The connection?
Who?  I need to know.  Ah, never mind. We'll talk about it later.
I'm married, George.  Me.  I can't believe it.  Can you believe I'm married, George?
Take it easy!  Everything's okay!
Derek Foreal.
George, I am happy to see you.  How are you, my brother?
I just can't get over the size of that ring.  I just love it.  Fred, look at it.  Tell me you don't love that ring.
I see.  I'm sorry about this, George. I'm not happy about this situation. It's bad.  You now know who your Brutus is.
Yeah, you are.  I can tell by the way you look at me.
Give it to her, Dad.  It'll make her happy.
Tell Mom, you know...
I meant every word of it.
What the fuck are you talking about, man?
Source?  What about Derek?
No.  These are her first steps.  Watch her.
Alright.
Not in front of the kid.
Yeah.  She told me.  You walk her to school.
She's getting big.  Getting her own ideas.
Hey, George.  You okay?
Yeah.
Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart. Don't be upset.
What do you want from me?
Yeah.  Go out there, check it out, see what it's like.  I've got some stuff to do this week, but I'm thinking maybe Thursday.  Thursday after school.
There's schools in California.
Do you see him here in the courtroom?
It's a four-man operation.  Two on the ground.  Two in the air.
You saved my life, Dulli.  You'll never fucking know.  All you guys.  Everyone just got a raise.  Instead of ten percent, you get fifteen.
Ramon tells me you are looking for some mota.
For instance, something like this?
Ha ha ha.  You are funny.   Really, how much will you be needing?
Yeah?
Are we good?
Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, nine. Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, a thousand.  It's all there.  Wow.  A hundred and twenty-eight thousand dollars.
I can't believe we're stealing a plane.
The questions have already been asked. I would only like some precise answers, that's all ...
With an unloaded pistol?
Let's suppose you were a spy. In prison, when the NLF contacts you, you pretend to support the revolution, and then the French help you to escape ...
Even that could be a trick. You escape, then show up at the address which the brothers in prison gave to you, and so you are able to contact me ...
What's important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing.
You still haven't told me why you didn't let me kill him.
Why? Isn't he sleeping here?
It's clear. They'll do everything possible to make it fail.
No ...
Because they told us that we mustn't use weapons, now, when the time is right.
Please, we just want to take a short ride. A friend of mine has never seen the Casbah.
Before you ask there's nothing new on the coke.
I would have missed it -- but the phone rang and I let it play while I talked.  It looks like blank tape -- but it isn't.  It's been erased without any input signal coming in.
An inquiry into what?
So she knew about his heart?
Yeah.
The official cause of death was a cardiac arrest.
What can we prove?
What induced it?
-- And if he were in the midst of making love while under the influence of cocaine?
Did they argue the day before he died?
He was away on an extended vacation and just returned two days ago.
Objection sustained.
Objection, Your Honor.
C'mon -- think about it.  If she was going to kill Marsh why leave the nasal spray bottle there for the police to find?
Your Honor, this is a tape from Miss Lawson's answering machine.  I would like to play it now.
Objection.  The question calls for a conclusion on the part of the witness.
Were you aware of Mr. Marsh's heart condition?
Tell the court about that, please.
She was here?
I know this is a very personal subject, but could you be a little more specific?
Why not?
When you say your sexual relations with Miss Lawson were intense what exactly do you mean?
What did she do next, Mr. Roston?
Where did you meet Miss Lawson?
What eventually happened to your relationship with Miss Lawson?
What did she say?
You didn't grab her and try to kiss her?
Yes.
I may have been infatuated with her - - but I wouldn't perjure myself.
--And is Miss Lawson a patient of yours?
Miss Sellers, do you know Dr. Alan Paley?
Where did you meet him?
What about Miss Lawson?
How do you know it was cocaine that Miss Lawson had in the bathroom?
Could you repeat the last part of what Mr. Marsh said to you the day before his death?
I don't know.  I'm not sure.
Yes.
I've tried it.
Yes.
You take what people say and make it ugly.  You make others believe what you want them to.  She should have been found guilty.  She shouldn't have gotten off.
To show you this.  It's a letter from that lawyer, Koehler.  He wrote it to me the day after I saw him.  He's the one who told me I could get the money if Miss Lawson went to jail.
Are you going to represent me?
And that's exactly what the jury will see when they look at me.  That's why I need a very good lawyer, Mr. Dulaney.
What do you think?
Yeah.
You lied to me!
No, I don't have to believe you.  The jury has to believe you and answers like he's lying or she's mistaken aren't going to convince them.
You were brilliant today.
Can I see you later?
Sugar or honey?
So, sue me.  Things have changed.  I think you should go home -- and after you leave I see no reason for us to ever have contact again.
Hey, you know better than that.  What did I teach you to say when someone is accused of doing something?
Well, that's kind of how I am right now.
The witness will answer the question.
Your Honor -- the prosecution has introduced cocaine as one of the contributing reasons Mr. Marsh died. How it may have been introduced into the household is of vital importance.
You're on vacation, remember?  You're supposed to be relaxing.
If he files are you going to take the case?
Is that alright, Frank?
Sharon, it's late.  Can we get to the point?
I don't know.
Albert's got the stomach flu.
Did Marsh use it?
It's a beautiful picture of her.
I am so sick and tired of apologizing and not knowing what I've done!
Explain to me again why we didn't do this in Des Moines in an air conditioned office?
I thought everything WAS arranged.
"-- going over and over in my mind every detail, every moment of our time together and I ask myself, "What happened to me in Madison County?" I struggle to put it together in a way that allows me to continue knowing we're on separate roads. But then I look through the lens of my camera, and you're there. I start to write an article and I find myself writing it to you. It's clear to me now we have been moving towards each other, towards those four days, all our lives --
I can't believe she's making jokes.
I found out who Lucy Delaney is.  Remember the Delaneys from Hillcrest Road?
I bet mom could've helped her.
Not yet. You want to go?
Carolyn!
My niece had "the changes" when she was thirty-one.
Madge?
Roseman Bridge?
If I'm not taking you away from anything.
I can't describe it. I think it's from the loam in the soil. This very rich, earthy kind of... alive... No. No, that's not right. Can you smell it?
Oh.
No, really?
This won't take long. I'm shooting tomorrow morning. I just need to do some prep work.
Oh there you are.
Oh, that's nice.
Where are you staying while you're here?
Is the dizziness gone?
I better go. You sure you're all right?  It's been a pleasure. Sincerely.
Why? You uncorked a bottle. From what I can tell, I got here just in time. Any later and you'd have made the front page, running down Main Street naked, smoking Camels out of your butt.
Help cook?
"Making pictures." I like that. You really love what you do, don't you?
You drink bug repellent?
Are you all right?
Do you ever regret it? The divorce, I mean.
But it's not the same.
I'm sorry I didn't call sooner, but I just read your note. I stuffed it into my pocket. The light was fading and I had to get my shot.
It's Robert.
Sorry I'm late. Richard called.
Take me somewhere.
I bet you could do a book.
Why do you say that?
But you don't mind.
I can't do this, honey.
Uh-huh. And?
Well, why is that up to me? You're the one who's married. You told me you have no intention of leaving your husband.
How do you know what I experience?
What do you want me to say?
I won't be made to feel like I've done something wrong.
I DON'T WANT TO NEED YOU!
No matter how I keep turning it around in my mind -- it doesn't seem like the right thing.
No, they don't say much. But Carolyn's 16. She's just about to find out about all this for herself -- she's going to fall in love, she's going to try and figure out how to build a life with someone. If I leave what does that say to her?
You've got to know deep down that the minute we leave here. It'll all change.
Mrs. Johnson! Mrs. Johnson! Is it true Cary Grant has proposed to you?
What about his engagement to Dyan Cannon?
What about your husband?
'Bout 4:30.
Where you going?
Now?!  It's after eleven.
Betty.
Oh my God...!
It clearly states in the will --
Well, she was very specific. She wanted her ashes to be thrown over Roseman Bridge.
Well, it was notarized, and witnessed by a Mrs. Lucy Delaney. Maybe you can ask her.
Your father was his best friend.  He loved Jeremiah.  So he must hate him the most of all now.  He'll take his time. But even if it is too late.  If your father is dead.  It's not over.  The door has to be closed.
Died there?  How?
Hey, kid.
We practically paying him for the privilege of playing his club.
You soundin' like the old man now.
You tell my old friend Mackie, I'll be seeing him.  Soon.  Real soon.
You got a nice crib here.
Those 'fools' are my people.
My mama's bag and my granma's bag, and a long line of mamas before her.
But.
One simple word, three little letters. Yes.  That's all it's gonna take and we could move out of this dump, get the real deal.  Big houses, legit business...
Wait, Jimmy.  Think about it.  You woulda done the same thing if you was me.
You got a vision, girl.  Just like I got. Just like my momma had.  And the good Lord didn't give you that vision just for painting pretty pictures.  That's just wasted time.
I'm sorry, Momma.  Maybe next time.
You got his hands.  Beautiful hands.  I didn't even know.  That night.  When they - we - killed him, that you were already alive inside me.  Life's like that. Grows right out of death.
Sure, if it was really him.  But it isn't that simple.  Jimmy's body died a long time ago.  And his soul is long gone, and all that's left is that ravening, hungry spirit in the blood that soaked into the house itself, I suppose.
We'll have to sneak in.
In his grave there was a cloth or a dress or something.  Covered with blood.
Are they on the radio?
Way I figure, everything our parents tell us is part true and part total B.S.  And our whole job is figuring out for ourselves which is which.
Cinn?
He probably thinks he's saving you from something.  I'm sure that's what my mother thinks.
No, I want to stay with you guys.  But I can't.  I mean I'm not ready.
We gotta jump!
But maybe we're the ones who should be down there.  Doing something.  Making it better.
What are we doing down here?
Help me.  I'm so sorry.  But please, help me...
Look, even if anyone found anything there, it's twenty years ago.  They could never connect it to us.
You boys been hitting the pipe?
Maurice, even if it was true, what are you worried about?  Last time I checked, you weren't black.  I'm not sure what the hell you are.  But I know you aren't a black man.
Come on, Pop, all I want to know is one thing.  Just one thing after he made such a big deal out of it.  I bet it wasn't a big deal.  Was it, Caesar?
The next one blows off your dick.
We know how this was done, eh?
Sit down, Gino!
Gimme the gun.
I didn't expect --
Oh, shit ...
Don't worry, I'll get some more.
They were early.
That doesn't make any sense.
It's impossible!
I got it!  I know what I got to do! I got to get the money.
I need you ...
No I didn't.  Not if his body disappears and not if the money is still here.  Then they never showed up.
What are you doing?
Violet!
I saved you.
Try to keep the extra batteries for your aid around.
You're helping Rajeev?
Where is it?
Call me as soon as you get him.
Hello?
We had a report of gunfire, so if you could --
So this is temporary for you?
A favor?
Oh, I'm sorry --
Yeah.
Truck.
Oh no.  Shit.  I didn't know he would call you.  God, you must think |I'm a total nuisance.
A beer?
Caesar's Mafia, isn't he?
How did you meet him?
Five years is a long time.
I know what I am.  I don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder.
You mean Shelly?
Yes.
Caesar lives for these moments.  He tells me it's just the business, but I know it's more than that.  He likes it.  The violence.  I'll catch him in the bathroom mirror touching his scars.  He says they remind him who he his.  They're all like that. Except maybe Mickey.
You made a choice once.  Do you think you would make that same choice again?
Caesar will bring it to the apartment to count and go through |Shelly's books to figure out how he did it.
All right, let's say for the moment that I believe everything you are saying.
All right, now, tell me about Johnnie.
What happened?
Has Caesar ever seen him?
What did Gino drink?
What time did you say they would be there?
Any bodyguards?
Where will you be?
Why?
Believes it!  Jesus, it's driving him crazy.  He wants to kill him.  I don't know, Corky, I don't know what he is going to do.  I'm getting nervous, really nervous.
What if he doesn't run?
Oh, thank God.
I'm sorry, Corky ...
Unbelievable.  Can you believe that, Violet?
She's a gypsy.  If it's a cover, it's a great one.
That's all I get?
...yes -- oui -- uh...
Paris?
Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason Bourne.
You are a friend of his?
Jesus...
Okay.  Twenty thousand.  Ten now.  Ten there.
What if I say no?
Look, go ahead...put the radio on...
And you have no idea -- not a clue -- what came before that?
-- you could put it together --
We're about an hour away.
Look, I don't know what's up there.
This is your office?  God, you live like a monk...
WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME?
-- just --
-- let me do this, okay? --
-- I don't know what you're doing and you're scaring me -- what are you looking for? -- what just happened in there? --
What does that mean?  Jason, what does that mean?  Jason, please...who is he?
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
-- this is serious business down here and we cannot have people coming and going --
He run away often?
-- Miss Kreutz, please --
What do they have on the streets? The area.  They must have something.
-- what're you talking about? --
You're awake.  Can you hear me?  You've been shot.  I'm trying to help you.  You were in the water.  You've been shot.  It's okay now.
You're American.  I thought so. From your teeth -- the dental work --
...ervices.
...ergency procedures.
... And then some.
I think we'd better have a look.
Oh yeh? Where'd you get this from eh  out yer nostril?
Central Services don't take kindly to sabotage!
This is what you get when you have cowboys round yer ducts.
I think you've got your T41 crystal inductor wired up to a reverse bobbin- threaded-solenoid-control. It's either that or a new washer.
Aren't you a bit late? - the party started half an hour ago.
Mr. HELPMANN, what would you say to those critics who maintain that the Ministry Of Information has become too large and unwieldy ...?
Do you think that the government is winning the battle against terrorists?
Gillian Layton?
Yes, it's all a bit confusing but, it seems she was killed resisting arrest.
{winking at Sam) She doesn't like me telling anyone but she's pleased as anything really.
OK. Come back this afternoon, about four o'clock. If you give me the number of the case, I'll have the dossier here waiting.  My tailor,... well worth the investment.
Well, your A. Buttle has been confused with T47/215, an A. Tuttle. I mean, it's a joke! Somebody should be shot for that. So B58/732 was pulled in by mistake.
There are some real bastards in this department who don't mind breaking a few eggs to make an omelette, but thank God there are the new boys like me who want to maintain decent civilized standards of terrorist eradication. We've got the upper hand for the moment, but they're waiting for us to slip up, and a little slip- up like this is just the chance they're looking for.
What I've got to do now is pick up Tuttle, interrogate him at the same voltage as Buttle, to the same meter reading to the last penny, and juggle the books in electrical banking.
What's she done?
But surely, I mean, perhaps she just happened to live above the Buttles, and ...
Look, about the Layton woman - maybe she's just trying to help the Buttle family.
So what are you going to do about her?
Thanks, Jack. I'll be in touch.
Trust me.
I've been to Information Adjustments. They sent me here. They told me you had a form I had to fill in.
Yes.
You're a stupid, fat arsed, obstructive, fascist moron aren't you?
You think these are tits don't you?
What are you doing? For Christ's sake! Get moving!
You know, smoking's bad for you.
Yes, of course. Sorry.
It does doesn't it?
It's heavy.
What are you doing in Information Retrieval?
I mean, it doesn't suit you.
Look at that - right on time.
No. Please. They're going to arrest you.
I was right! Step on it!
What?
Please, Jill ... I love you.
I'm going to pull some strings. It's our only hope.
Perhaps the machine's on the blink! It keeps picking up old films. That can't he right, can it?
Oh, good!
It's your mother isn't it? Pulling strings again.
He is dead.
That's it.
Can I forget it?
No, you can't have any more chairs! There's only one left in here now, and I need that to sit on!  Oh ... er, sorry. Who are you?
Hey - that's my desk!
Mr Helpmann was very close to your poor father. He was very close to me. Still is. He'll take you under his wing at Information Retrieval. You'll like it when you get there.
Sam ... you haven't had dessert.
Sam!!! 
It's a refund ... I'm afraid there was a mistake.
Here we are! I'm going to leave you two lovebirds in peace.
Er, don't you want to search me?
My I.D. cards.
Are we?
No, not at all. I mean, it's all right. It's fixed.
I mean it fixed itself.
What is it?
Well I suppose one has to expect a certain amount
No English. She has terrible pain in her belly.
No underwear?
She wanted something to help her sleep.
I've been thinking about things. Meditating on my financial future. You guys gave me plenty of time to meditate on the future. Whatja do, stop for Chinese on the way over? There's plenty of food in my place.
I'm not your baby, Young, I'm not your mother either. You're going to a cardiac arrest, Avenue C and Ninth, northeast corner. It's a club. Take the side entrance.
Twelve Young, answer the radio. I have a call for you.
You're going to three-four Avenue C, 17 year-old female cardiac arrest, no further information.
IB Bangin.
You're not going to die.
Here, you try.
Is there any chance?
It's my first cigarette in over a year.
I mean if he was dead, I could handle that.
Right now, I'm more worried about my mother than anything. They won't let her see my father.
You shouldn't smoke.
I think this place stinks.
It's crazy in there. What's wrong with that doctor? He keeps mumbling, poking himself in the eye when he talks to me.
I knew. I sensed it when I heard your voice.
I was going nuts in that waiting room so I came back to check on my mom.
Sleeping.
Five years.
You learn to sort of block it out, you know, like cops fence off a crime scene. But then something good will happen and everything will just glow.
I think I'd remember that.
Excuse me. You seemed like you were in trouble.
OK, last night I was weak. it won't happen again. And all that shit I said--it was just because I was stoned. Forget it.
Nobody gets fired. Look at me. Only thing they might do is transfer you to the Bronx. You look like you aged ten years since I rode with you last.
No, you never listened. I was going, man, if someone on high hadn't pulled me in. I had put all I had into saving this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down, there was a part of me that wanted to go with him.
Rule number one: Don't get involved with patients. Rule number two: Don't get involved with patient's daughters. You understand?
Oh Jesus, put her on the monitor. Where's the pediatric code cart?  Odette give me that tube. All right, flatline--let's do CPR. step back, Frank. How many months?
Fourteen. We finally got him a room upstairs. Should be up there in a couple of hours.
That's good, Frank. No, but they might surgically implant one, about the size of my thumb. It goes near the shoulder here, with two electrodes connected to the heart. It sends a shock whenever it senses a drop in blood flow. Amazing, isn't it?
Last show of the night.
Our mission is coffee, Tom. A shot of the bull, Puerto Rican espresso.
Whatja doing?
You okay?
We're gonna save you, Noel. You're gonna be all right.  Do it, Tom! I'll call for fucking backup, I swear!
I'm so stupid. I had beef lo mein last night. I can't eat the same thing two nights in a row. It's almost two o'clock, what the hell am I gonna do? What you getting?
Oh yeah, you don't eat food.
They'll just keep calling.
Jesus, Tom Walls, that crazy motherfucker.
You're in the stomach! Let me try.
Look, Frank, when I say don't answer it, that means answer it.  You can do that for me at least.  Three Zebra.
Shit, shit, shit...
One source referred to it as a five billion dollar metal sculpture to ugly to look at and too big to bury.
Hi, Aaron...What's doing?
Don't let your eyes go from the beginning of the sentence to the end like that.  You don't want to look shifty, do you?
London.
You're saying the fact that you're gay had something directly to do with your promotions?
Where's where I asked him about being scared?  You should work on your speech.
Okay.  I feel like I'm slipping but do people who are actually slipping feel that way or is it always the really good people who are moving up who invariably think they're slipping because their standards are so high?
I'd give anything if that were true.
Me again.  Hi.  Listen Gaddafi doesn't foam at the mouth or anything.  When you speak to him he's not at all nuts. He seems like a leader -- very impressive, self-control...that's what's so strange.
Tom...why don't I meet you there? I've got some last minute stuff I've got to take care of...Hey, how did you resolve your dilemma -- did you rent the tux or buy it...I knew it. How much?  Wow...Okay...See you there...
Thanks, Jane.  Have a good time tonight.
No.
I told what's his name -- Tom -- that I'd meet him.
Don't go.
You can't end up with Tom because it goes totally against everything you're about.
How?
You were quick enough to get Tom's help when...
I've got to not say that aloud; it takes too much out of me.
You are now required to sit here with me.  Come on...be smart for a second -- what do you think will happen to us?
So who's the guy?
I like it!  So, doll, what about you lately?
That's it.  I resign as of now.
Anyway.  I want you to think of this as...
Aaron, I've never seen them like this -- I think Paul's nervous about his own job and for some reason he thinks you only appeal to...
All I know is that they've got to fire a large number of people... and they're not going by seniority. There's a recklessness in the air. They...
Prepare what?  You have Saturday's news handy?
We came from Washington.
Norman Rockwell's 'Homecoming.'
I was a little nervous there for a minute.
Just when do you start, telling people?
I'd like to take everyone out after the show.
Aaron should be hearing this so I have an extra witness.
No, I don't.  He happens to deserve the credit.  He's right here.
I've got to tell Ernie...because there isn't enough time.
What are you dressed up for?  Oh, that's right -- because the Evening News is here this week.
They canned me.  Well, my brother will feel great -- now he's not the only screw-up.
Do you want him all the way to the car?
I've been doing some morning show stuff, but mostly radio -- that doesn't bother me.  I'm in no rush for anything.  It's just the snotty attitude, even if I have it coming, it's still...
...and the White House is hoping to keep a lid on it for a few days till they figure out what to do.
Hey, Buddy, don't do that anymore.
Ernie, they're calling from work.
Jane -- For God's sake...  Look, it's time for you to go to sleep.
Were you bothering by those waitresses making a fuss?
Thanks, Dad, this talk helped.  Will you sign it, please?
It must be nice to always believe you know better.  To think you're always the smartest person in the room.
I kept thinking what a great break it was for me to get to see you tonight.  More than a great break, maybe just what I needed...just when I needed it...Angel of mercy -- godsend...lifesaver...what?
I was doing sports at the station. The newspaper ran this untrue story that I was leaving and they got all these tons of protest mail.  So they made me anchor.
Whoa, this was a mistake.
I never told you the reason I was telling you everything for.
Nervous?
I'm not sure I dialed right -- Jane?
It's not important.
No.  Are you going to the Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday?
So what did you think?
I forgot all about Aaron.  I promised to stop by and see how he did.
I'm not sure.  It seems like he had sort of a mishap on the news.
I don't know if that's absolutely necessary.
Uh-huh.
Okay.  Good night.
I feel terrible about what happened. What did he say?
That's not going to be the way we say good-bye.  Even though I think what you did was rotten -- it's not all impersonal.  You mean something to me.
I knew what you meant.
You're lucky I came after you so you got that off your...
It's just that one of the few things I'm not confused about is what I was saying downstairs, that...
I converted a bedroom -- this stuff builds up.  Wait till you've been doing this sixteen years.
That's not true I am a sculptor!
Not even a little bit?
It's just an innocent question.  Besides I just wanted to clarify your intentions.
Look -  This pose is all wrong!
Alright we're clear.
What did he do?
What's it called?
It's called spontaneity, Leonard. Get with the program.
These guys came by to help me try out some of my new organic recipes.
Is it murdered man?
You think she's better than Murdered Man?
Nice night out...
Oh, I don't know.  Smart people. Creative people I guess.
Walter...  I don't want to hurt your feelings but there is no way we're ever going to get...together.  You know what I mean?
I've been thinking...  Carla, would you do one favor for me?
Walter...there's...
I'm trying to find a style of my own.  Do you really like them?
Hi Walter...
Maybe so...
Are you alright?
Yeah, I'm feeling a lot better.
What's the matter with you?
It will take years to make that many statues.  But your work would be featured.
It's our road kill series.  I take the pictures.
I wonder what his deal is.
Man if you want to be a legit artist you have to do nudes, nudes, nudes...
That's alright, we got a pressing engagement!
Walter, what are you doing?
Well...why did you put a knife in it?
Go home.
Whatsamatter Leonard?
Listen to me...I don't want to lose this piece -
I was going to make some pancakes, you can have some if you like.
I also saw the girl give you this.
I saw your...cat.
Maxwell.
Hi.
I get it Walter.  I get it.
With Dead Cat.  Like a breath of fresh air.  I could just - babble on about it for hours.
Good night Walter...
I don't think this is gold.
What's wrong with you!?!
You reckless imbecile.  This place is ours for the taking and you let yourself... twelve hundred years old and you act like a child.
Well, um... litter?
... And they're having some memorial service or something tomorrow.  You going?
Figures.
Hey!  She wasted my dog!
Benny, man, where you been?  You bailed on me, I passed out, man, I almost did a Jimi Hendrix!
Let me in, Pike!  I'm hungry!
Wheels?
Are there any good sicknesses that aren't too depressing?
Dying.
What's Bobby gonna say?
What'd you dream about?
Buffy, what are you doing here?
No, you didn't.  When?
You left me a message?
Will you guys shut up, please?
Well, stay here tonight.
Things are kind of confusing.
Pike, I don't think you're up to this.
Dress, huh?  What for?
Come again?
It's not a mixer.  It's the senior dance.  And it's important.  You wouldn't understand.
I don't want to kill anybody, and I don't want to talk about it anymore.
You're staying here.  Some of them might not come after me.  If they don't this place is gonna turn into a total stain.
Good thing one of us was prepared.
It has to be, like a socially conscious theme.
It is a pretty crucial subject.
Like what?
God, where the hell did you come from?  You scared me to death.
Let me get this straight.  You're like, this greasy bum, and I have to go to the graveyard with you 'cause I'm chosen, and there's vampires.
Does Elvis talk to you?  Tell you to do things?  Do you see spots?
Everybody does.
I don't know.  It was...  There was a big gram or something.  And there's one, I'm like a prostitute...
I can't believe I'm doing this.  I can't believe I'm in a graveyard with a strange man hunting for vampires on a school night.
Go to school tomorrow.  Try to act normal.  Don't let anyone know what's happening.  This is important. When the vampires find out who you are... you won't be hunting them anymore.
It's not pretty, but it does suit our purposes.
A Vampire-King?  You mean like Dracula?
What?
Uh... gym.
Well, everybody says... it's just kind of dorky.  I mean, have you ever seen a gymnast's legs?  They're like --  -- the mighty oak.  It's not a look.
Here?
Toasty.  Were there ever any, like, famous vampires?
All right.  You've heard of the emperor Caligula, perhaps?  Or Jack the Ripper?
Same one.
And why are you always wearing black? It's so down.  It's totally not your color.  I don't think you have a color.
Five?
I'm curious, is all.
Well, you know, I'm not gonna kick so easy.  I've got a few things the other girls didn't have.
Interesting.
Sooner or later you're going to have to accept it.  Your fate.
Wait!
Mr. Howard is so heinous.  He's always giving me a hard time.  I get a C-plus on the test and he tells me, 'You have no sense of history.'  I have no sense of history?  He wears a brown tie.
No THX.
So, is Jeffrey really spending the night at your house?
You guys blow.  I'm waiting on Cassandra.  She's gonna help me with my history.
Buffy, Jesus!  You know these steps.
Listen, you little worm.  I could beat your head to a pulp for you, just like I did last year, you got that?  You got that?
Well, I'm done.  Are you done?
So they found Cassandra's body out by the railway tunnels.  Nobody's saying anything, but they think she was involved in something, like, illegal or something.  Like dealing.
You're kidding.
Cool!
I'm sorry.  I'm Pike.  This is Benny.
God!  Take a chill lozenge.
Oh, yeah!
I really was way way too too.
It's amazing what you can do with a parachute and some starch.
No...  You want me to give him a message?
Ah, you'll be coming back.
You're patronizing me!  I will not be patronized--
How ya like that?
I can't keep up with you.  First you say sex is gonna make me a better pitcher--now no sex is gonna do it?!
I'm yours.
Fundamentals?
Well--he calls it the Bermuda Triangle.  He said a man can get lost in there and never be heard from again.
I knew it--you're seducing me!
Ebby Calvin Nuke LaLoosh--don't think too much.
These are the ground rules.  I hook up with one guy a season-- I mean it takes me a couple of weeks to pick the guy--kinda my own spring training...  And, well, you two are the most promising prospects of the season so far.  So...  I thought we should get to know each other.
After 12 years in the minor leagues, I don't tryout.  Besides-- I don't believe in, Quantum Physics when it comes to matters of the heart...or loins.
I think Thomas Pynchon's a genius.
I'm committed to Nuke for the season.  You had your chance the other night.
Don't tell anybody.
Well, Annie, your place or mine?
A batter has two tenths of a second to decide whether to swing--
Crash...I want you.
You're gorgeous, God damn it! From the moment I first saw you I knew I had to have you.  I had to have you!
I think of you and the "boy" all the time.
And now you wanta teach me?
I doubt that.
Are you gonna be waking up next to 20 year old ballplayers when you're 60?
Why not?
Salem, Massachusetts?  Where all the witches were?
You think I could make it to the Show as a manager?
Oh no--he's shaking off the sign, Jackson.  Big mistake...
Thanks for the note--you're right, I wasn't bending my back.
Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.
Well--you boys stopped fighting yet?  Are you pals now?  Good.  I love a little macho male bonding-- I think it's sweet even if it's probably latent homosexuality being "re-channeled" but I believe in "re-channeling" so who cares, right?  Shall we go to my place?
Is somebody gonna go to bed with somebody or what?
Fun?  What's he know about fun?  Why's he calling for a curveball? I wanta bring heat.
Fastball.
Guy hit the shit outta that one, eh?
An' he scrambled the son of a bitch.  Having fun yet?
He did know.
You don't need a quadraphonic Blaupunkt--you need a curve ball.  In the Show, everybody can hit the fastball.
You're through with one night stands?!  What do you want?
You're weird, man--I want a ice skater real bad.
What would you think of a pitcher who wore women's panties?
I was playing naked.
You told him I was throwing a deuce, right?
I love winning, Crash, you hear me?  I love It.  Teach me everything.
Well, I got Annie all warmed up for ya...  She's just waiting for you to show up, y'know...
I'm too old for this shit.  Why the hell am I back in "A" ball?
We want you to room with him on the road and stay on his case all year.  He can go all the way.
Step outside, pal.
No way.
No.  If I screw up, I wanta do it alone.  I'll call.
He walked eighteen?!
Sears sucks, Crash, I tried it once.  Sold Lady Kenmores--it's nasty, nasty work.
Patkin was a tribute to baseball...
The organization wants to make a change...now that Nuke's gone they wanta bring up some young catcher...
Who ain't?
Ain't here.
Hi, Ace.
Hey, I need a room. Need a room.
You were in the m- You were in the building.
A powerful man.
He's on all night, screamin' about how he's gonna take his damn lawsuit all the way to the Supreme Court. He really must be crazy. He's gonna go to Washington with this?  He's out of his fuckin' mind.
Okay, Randy. Thank you.
Hello.
Mm-hm.  1862. Okay, good. I'll call you right b-
Sam, let me ask you a question. You must really trust your wife.
Amy! Amy, open the door!
When did this happen, honey?
It was eight.  Ace... tell him the line on the Bear's game.
Holy shit, what've you been doin' out here?
Especially at the casino, where he definitely did not work, people got the message.
I mean, Nicky's a made guy and I'm not. I can't do that.
No, I didn't know that. But you know what he did?
What?
All right, Ace?
Hey, I gotta give the guy credit. He does the most obvious thing. This is the only town in the country where a bookie joint is legit, so, why not take advantage, right?  So... he took bookie joints off the street and then opened them up inside the casino. Well, within a few years, by doin' all of this, he had every casino on the Strip trying to copy off him.
' ...detrimental to gaming. And he will be ejected from any casino in Las Vegas...  and the casinos can be fined as much as a hundred thousand every time he shows up.'  Do you believe this shit?
Let's say... for instance... I want to go in the restaurant which happens to be in the casino... to get one of those sandwiches I like?
Hey, Ace.
You think he got the point?
I have no control over that. Ronnie and Billy were right there. They'll tell you exactly what happened.
Every time you're on television I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad.
That's right, yeah.
Where the fuck you get off talkin' to people about me behind my back? Goin' over my head?
What people! What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out?
No? You said I'm bringin' heat on you?! I gotta listen to people because of your fuckin' shit?! You're ordering me out?! You better get your own fuckin' army, pal!
Back - Back up, back up a fuckin' minute here. One minute. I asked you?! When the fuck did I ever ask you if I could come out here?! Get this through your head, you -
I know. Why didn't you come to me? I mean, this is family, it ain't business. Meanwhile, you make calls back home. Sammy, it makes us look bad out here, you know what I mean? Back and forth, this one and that one, and, in the meantime, she's gone anyway. Am I right?
I think if you, uh, okay it, you know, assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back.
Yeah, uh, who's this?
Hey, it is my pleasure.
No problem.  Sorry.
Son-of-a-bitch. How the hell did you get Oklahoma-Michigan?  Nobody ever had Oklahoma-Mi... How the hell'd you do it?
Seven o'clock?
Oh, yes. Will you help me fold these, please?
You know, I don't feel like playin' tennis.
Want something to drink? Charlie you want a refill?
...and she doesn't always -
I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert, as my manager and I went to work.
He's juiced in. He's the County Commissioner's cousin.
Help the Senator, give him whatever he wants.
Sam, we got a problem.
I'm going to go powder my nose. 
I'll be right back.
Okay, thank you for asking.
Any change?
...she took care of the valet parkers, the guys who could get you anything and take care of anything.
Within no time, everything was set in place. We got rid of the freelance scamsters. The per was way up.  The gods were happy, or as happy as the gods can ever be.  And I, I decided to complicate my life. For a guy who likes sure things, I was about to bet the rest of my life on a real longshot.
You got the wrong girl, Sam.
You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.
If it doesn't work out. You know, if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me?
What're you... what're you pitching me, here?
It's all right. That part of your life is over with. Right?
You're with me now.
Crooked cops and kidnappers, they don't take checks.
Well, if you want a coat, you got it. You know that. It's not the money, it's just why do you want it?  That's all I'm askin'. Am I not entitled to that?
You're askin' me for twenty-five thousand. I'm not out to make you feel bad. I want to just be able to trust you. You now, it's about trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life. Do you understand? Can I trust you?  Can I trust you?... Can I trust you?... Answer me. Can I trust you?
I didn't take your pills.
You understand? Your drinking's gettin' way out of hand. I'm gonna get you into a program. They got plenty of good ones.
Yes, I - yes, I do.
...routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.
Hello.
Do you... I mean... I don't think she should go by herself.
...the rest of the two million is still there?
Yeah.
Plus, at the most, three suits, a thousand apiece. That still leaves what?  Around ten thousand?
I'm just tryin' to figure it out.
The arrangement is over!
You're lower than a dog!
Yeah, no kidding. Good! It opens at 9 a.m. Be there!
I had a... salad.
All right... I didn't have lunch with Jennifer.
She wasn't gonna get up. I was just gonna be out for a little while.
I'll sign anything you want me to sign, okay?
Get - get up!
I wouldn't -
I am not!
You are not threatening me anymore!
Yeah, thanks for not callin' me a liar. You son-of-a-bitch. You son-of- a
It won't happen again, Sam.
Loose machines are right back over there.
Well...
All right, I will, I will.
Three fuckin' jackpots in twenty minutes? Why didn't you pull the machines? Why didn't you call me?
You didn't see the scam? You didn't see what was goin' on?
Yes, there is. An infallible way! They won!
Listen, you fuckin' yokel, I've had it with you. I've been carryin' your ass in this place ever since I got here. Get your ass and get your things and get out of here.
You might regret this, Mr Rothstein.
We had to make an example of these pricks that the party was over.
No.
When I left here with the money...
...I got muscled on the street.
Yeah.
Fuckin' kids at home!  Here.  Get the fuck out of here.
Yes.
No, I don't want one.  Hey, Mr Clark, how you doin'?
Yeah.  I think I want my money back.
Fucker!
Hey!
There's nothing we can do. She had the key.
Fuck you! Fuck you!
Beautiful. You got a beautiful swing.
Now go out there and show your dad what you can do.
It's instinctive, you know.
Do you see that? Dumb Jew motherfucker. Grew up together and he's actin' like he don't even know me. I know we're supposed to avoid each other, but, you know, there's ways to do things and there's ways not to.
Forget about it, Nick. Don't let it bother you.
Carmine? He was here before. I saw him. He had a suitcase and everything, and then he left.
I think, you know, maybe he went across the street or somewhere else or somethin'. I don't know.
No, I won't calm down! He's my husband!
Frankie... they found a guy's head in the desert. Do you know about that?
Are you sure?
Hi, Jennifer.
Hi, how are you?
Thank you.
So, I'm gonna call you back in an hour... at this number, and you're gonna be there, right?
What were you gonna say? Go ahead.
Tell me what you were gonna say. Go ahead.
You know?
You did. I like that. I like that. That's what I like about you. You did the right thing.
Yeah.  Boy, he really fucked himself up out here -  - didn't he?
He hates my fuckin' guts.
Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Get the fuck out of here.
...same outfit.
Yes!
Come on.
What do you mean, 'What's the matter?' I made a lot of money for you. I want my cut.
What money?  Look at this stack of chips. Don't give me that shit. I want my end.
Don't give me that shit. I want my money.
What does that mean? No, I know that look. What does that mean?
Right.
Just knock it off! Would you two knock it off? Get in the car.
Yes, don't worry.
Excuse me, but I folded these things beautifully and I would appreciate a little respect. Jesus Christ!
Incredible.
How many of these you gonna eat, huh?
You walk past me?
And this is Stacy.
I do all the work. Somebody don't like it, fuck him.
Sue me, you Jew fuck!
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
Don't know.
Oh, God! Give me the fuckin' name!
Charlie M?
All right, yeah. You got that thing for me?
Pardon me, counselor. Before you continue...
Do I hear a motion seconded?
Again!
That's enough.
I know it, I know it.
...everything's comin' out of my pocket. I gotta pay for all these trips back and forth, back and forth.
Hi.
Hey, Hot Stuff. You're still on the clock...
The crowd bought it.
You say that like an amnesia victim.
But of course you are. Dinner at Eight.  Wouldn't miss it.
I'm sorry I went off like that, I get passionate. I--I guess I'm a passionate person. One of those things I had forgotten.  When you were a little boy did you want to grow up to be a superhero?
This is insane. Let the heroes handle it.  I'd better get you home...I should check on my warehouse to make sure it hasn't been hit...
Fine. You're angry. Don't be. The important thing is we're together now..
Exactly. I don't know what I'd do without you.
Hmm. Not bad.
Quite a pair we make. Thank you, Jeff.
Selina Kyle...lovely person.
Selina, are you okay?
You're right, I wasn't looking to fall in love with a casino worker. I'd given up trying to find anyone. But there was a fire in your eyes that cut right through the air conditioning and through the coldness of my heart.
Catwomen. Lots of them!
Oh Honey, it's so much better when we do it without the helmet.
Pass!
What's the catch?
Not now, Mammoth. Adonis is right. We've had a good run here--the protection kickbacks from the crime syndicates, the merchandising scams-- Tomorrow night we have a big, violent, complicated and lucrative mission to pull off. We chould be resting up.
My, the Perpetrator seems to be a bit on the "Wild" side..
You're not a super-hero. You're not even a hero. You're a scary, sick, fake who made a big mistake. You killed someone very special to me..
I'm supposed to be taking personality tips from you three?  You people were once heroes. You had ideals.  You fought for things.  Spooky told me so...
Oh no, not a computer disc. A computer disc?  Oh man, come on, what do I look like?  I'm not a crime- fighter, I'm not a detective, what, I'm supposed to find some "clues" on this disc. I can't...
I don't know what came over me.
Hey, architect--she's joking. Right, Selina?  Selina?
Have you seen the Oasisburg Police? They drive golf carts with little red sirens.
Was someone in an accident?
What are you doing on Theo's line?
I know where it is.  Give me that phone back.
I know you feel awful but it's not your responsibility.
Lady, don't let him do it!
Nels reporting in.  Sit down where you are.  Arms folded.
Yeah, I suppose getting whacked has got to be one of your best ways to die.  Particularly if you're not expecting it.  You don't know what hit you.
I told you I should've cuffed him.
You never miss a trick.
We have never worked a gig together but I am a firm believer in preparation.  So let's go over this again step by step.
That's your "rep."
That's illegal.  You want us pulled over?  I'll turn around at the corner if you'll shut the fuck up.
Nels, don't let that cop pass you.
No.  <u>You</u> don't understand!  You caught me on my cellular on the way to pick up some business associates.  And I've got no time to screw around.
Well I'm not tolerant of being bothered with this bullshit story when I'm about to make the most important score of my life.  This has gotta be some "put-on," right?
I am not involved.  Keep clicking your little wires.  You'll get someone else.  Good luck.
Who?
Please.
26th off Wilshire.
What do you think I'm doing?  I'm on my way to the school like you wanted.
I don't know.  80 or 90 minutes, tops.
Our house always needs touching up.
I have no right to ask for help. I've never thought of anybody but myself.
There are cables overhead.  Hang on.  It'll clear up.
Does she have a red ribbon on that ponytail?
Does she wear glasses?
I should've put them out of the car and come sooner!
Which means you can't be more than five or ten minutes from here.
How come everybody turns out to be a crook?
I've got a lot of respect for you too.  For the way you feel about your family.
Once you're in the car with me she's sure to come to us.
Rachel -- Oh my God.
Rachel was terrified when I left her.  I could see it in her eyes.
We've almost got your husband and your daughter out.  So don't get any ideas.
He had a gun.  I have it now.
You're not Lenore Oberfeld.
The guy with the transplant.
Tell them I'm keeping what's left. I earned it.  I probably killed some poor bastard for it.
Those shots your associates got off may not have done him too much good.  That's on their head.  All I did I was put him there.
He wants 75 back.
They'll have units blocking us up ahead.
Wonderful feeling of security knowing your adversaries are both crippled and unarmed.
Think you could do a picture of me?
Developer ran out of money years back.  I'd hate to think about what's living in there.
Know what else is in here?
Five ... six.
I've got ... one last number for you, Theo ...
They saw you kill the driver.
There's no loyalty at the expense of my own ass.
I'm three quarters of the way up the lot behind the concession stand.
Satisfied?
Be careful in disposing of them. You'll have to discount 'em. You'll be lucky to clear a hundred and a quarter.
And then?
I'm opening the side door.  She'll step out.  But before she gets in your vehicle I want to see the first installment put down in plain view.  If it isn't there I'm shooting her in the back.
Stop the crying.
Okay Nels, you can always keep what you've got and haul ass leaving the lovely lady for me to worry about.  I'll bet she can be friendly when it's in her best interests.
If he pulls me over he gets all the proceeds plus Lenore here.
From what I can see you're a pretty fair wheelman.  There's a hairpin coming up -- that's the place for it. The cops'll plow right into you.
Yeah?
Who's this?
I can see the benefit in that.
In the hills above Sunset.  Just below the Getty.
How far off are you?
Somebody better tear this down before it falls down.
Who were you talking to?
Brilliant -- unless they were close enough to see the cab pull away.  In which case you just warned them.
Seems not.
Why are you picking on me for?
Let me talk to the lady again.
If her kid or her old man have been harmed we've also got nothing to talk about.
Can I make a quick call?
What kind of Treasury Dept. business is this?
I thought so.
Now he can look.... Ask him does he like his hair, Col.
He agreed that he was.
Thank you.
Fuck off back to Essex!
Look, I'm sorry.
If I was her I'd consider that an insult.
Sorry won't bring the bloody thing back, will it, Mr. Franknum?
Who?
And what's it like?
You old-fashioned?
You all right?
Make a pass or something. Isn't that the way it goes?
You got a special friend, Jimmy?
What'll it be?
Someone out there.
He was different.
Are you jealous of him?
Do you miss him?
I think you do.
Do I?
Shouldn't you be in mourning?
Maybe.
What does that mean?
Why?
Did he ever tell you you were beautiful?
Come on, Dil --
Never let the sun go down on an argument, Jody used to say.
Got your note. So let's kiss and make up, hon.
You're something else, Dil, you know that?
You could?
So I'm sorry.
And you're not going to tell me more?
You promise?
So it's true, then?
Why?
Good-bye, Dil
Dil Can I tell you something? I knew your man.
Wondered why you came on to me like that when you gave me the look.
You like me now, Jimmy?
Give me a bit more, baby, a bit more.
Tell me you love me.
You do?
And you'll never leave me?
What was that she called you, Jimmy?
What's Fergus?
Lucky you.
You don't know that.
But you know what the thing is, Fergus?
Leave her out of this.
Dil!
You sure?
You OK about that?
I thought it was Dave.
You trying to hurt my feelings?
But I won't. We're more polite around these parts.
What makes you think that?
Shut the fuck up, would you?
So what were you fucking around for, then?
Nice to meet you, Fergus.
Take it easy, now. Just go slow. Down by that tree.
Now, that was worth waiting for.
Thank you. I had a case of the clap two years ago. Crabs in Ulster. But all in all it's served me well.
Depends on what you believe in.
You liked her?
Help me.
Go to sleep now.
What?
Not a lot of use, are you, Fergus?
Hurling's a fast game, isn't it, Fergus?
Faster than cricket?
So if I ran now, there's no way I'd beat you, is there?
Never pissed holding a girl's hand, Jude.
And you know what?
Not here.
See, if we took the hood off, we'd have to shoot you. As it is, you've got a fifty-fifty chance.
What are you talking about?
It's simple. I like what I do -- I enjoy doing it. There aren't many men who love their work as much as I do. Look around some time.
I could eat a horse.
What?
Oh, you should see your face.
When you come on, you really come on.
I just heard from him -- he's still hungry. That means killing Gideon didn't get it for him -- so he's narrowed it down to us. You've got it.
Electric razor -- comb -- steamship ticket -- fountain pen -- four passports -- toothbrush -- wallet --  key -- what about that?
Yes, you told me.
Grandpierre asked me about an appointment Charles had -- on the day he was killed.
Well, you're right there. Ten minutes ago I had a job.
Reggie -- why won't you listen?
Reggie -- listen to me!
You didn't have to chase me so hard --
Dry-cleaningwise, things are all fouled up. I had a good man -- an excellent man on the Rue Ponthieu, but H.Q. asked us to use the plant here in the building -- to ease the gold outflow.
Do you know what C.I.A. is, Mrs. Lampert?
Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government.
Aren't they?  Now look at this one, Mrs. Voss, and --
I believe you.
Or a safe deposit key, a certified check, a baggage claim -- you look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm quite sure you'll find it.
We've no proof, of course, but we rather think so, yes.
Oh.
I don't know who this Mr. Dyle is, but it's just possible we were wrong about who killed your husband.
He has a gun, Mr. Bartholomew -- I saw it.
Dyle, or whatever his name is.
Go on, please -- five men -- $250,000 -- the French Underground --
Carson was dying so they were forced to leave him. They finally got back to the base, made their report, and waited for the war to end. Only Charles couldn't wait quite as long as the others. He beat them back to the gold, took everything for himself and disappeared. It's taken Gideon, Tex and Scobie all this time to catch up with him again.
C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert. We're an extension of the wartime O.S.S. It was our money and we want it back.
I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert. You'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave. Those men won't be very far away -- no matter where you go. In fact, I don't even see any point in your changing hotels. Please help us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is counting on you.
No, Mrs. Lampert.
Are you sure there's no mistake?
The envelope -- imagine that.  Mrs. Lampert, listen to me -- you're not safe as long as you've got these stamps. Go to the Embassy right away -- wait, I'd better meet you halfway -- it's quicker. Now, let's see -- do you know the center garden at the Palais Royal? -- yes, by the colonnade -- as soon as you can get there. Hurry, Mrs. Lampert.
That's a face you don't forget -- he was there too --
Is there a Mrs. Cruikshank?
If you do anything funny, or try to talk to anyone, I'll kill you, Dyle -- here and now. Okay?
Sorry about that.
Do I knock or something?
He's just tryin' to throw us off! They've got it, I tell you! Why don't we search their rooms?
We'd better exchange keys. Here's mine.
I thought that was Peter Joshua.
Because he's wearing moccasins.
I hope it turns out you're a Whitefoot, Alex -- I could be very happy hanging around the tepee.
What are you doing?
The phone's ringing --
Hello, Herman, it was a happy landing, I see.
Come on -- let's get busy. Who gets your vote?
I'd love some, thanks.
Hm?
Maybe somebody felt that four shares were too many --
Yes, I know.
Hurry up and change -- I'm starved.
What are you doing?
No -- not yet.
I can explain if you'll just listen. Will you listen?
It led me away from umbrella frames, for one thing. But that left me without any honest means of support.
Sorry, the name's Adam Canfield.
Yes.
Have you ever, in your entire life, seen anything so beautiful?
It is called 'The Hawaiian Blue' and there are only seven left. In 1894 the owner of one was murdered by a rival collector who was obsessed to own it.
I'm -- I'm sorry.
That was a dumb move, Herman -- a dumb move.
What for? If it's not here, why bother him?
You don't s'pose one o' us has it, like the man said -- I mean, that'd be pretty distasteful -- us bein' vet'rans o' the same war 'n' all.
Dead, Mrs. Lampert -- like last week's news -- like Charles, Mrs. Lampert --
I'm afraid that will have to wait, Mrs. Lampert.
Is it all right?
Obviously.  One ticket of passage to South America -- one letter, stamped but unsealed, addressed to you --
I don't understand.
I was, too.
Come on, now -- if you wanted to hide something, where would you put it?
Swell -- only this man doesn't have a garden.
I hope I don't find any little hairy things living up here -- wait! There is something! If I can just -- yes, I'm getting it -- a case of some sort -- it's heavy.
Up there! It is up there!
Sorry. Which view would you like?
Good for you.
No, I'm not -- I've got some packing to do. I'm also going back to Paris today.
Do you know what you're going to do?
What's going on?
Right there, between your eyes -- see? Worry lines. You're much too young and too pretty to have anything like that. How about making me vice- president in charge of cheering you up?
En garde.
You haven't said a word since we left the club -- what happened back there?
I don't think I follow you.
Who said?
We're here.
How would you like a punch in the nose? Stop treating me like a child.
Nothing. Good night.
Peter -- are you all right?
What?
Go on.
I'm so hungry I could faint.  I've -- I've gotten your suit all wet.
They're only trying to scare you, that's all.
Don't ask me -- I'm only the widow.  If Charles had died in bed we wouldn't even have him.
Have you no idea who could have done it?
Sylvie -- ? What are you doing here?
Why?
You do?
If I'm so all-used-up Ben, why do you try to hook me up non-stop?
Ok not your imports. All your other CDS and your K2 snowboard.
One more time.
Why'd you send for Lenny Marliston?
I've been in the same class with Stacy for years but we weren't tight or anything.
No!
What kind of a person wakes up in the morning and says to themselves, 'Think I'll nail a sixteen year old girl to a tree today'?
We need you here. I can bring her in.
Well?
Hello?
Can you describe her? How old was she?
I know where you're going.
Ok. Should I put my bike in the back of your car?
Don't you want to talk to him? You watch him eat everyday.
What am I supposed to say? 'Nice sweater Mark'? 'Did you buy it at Eddie Bauer's?'
No!
It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time.
Unfortunately I qualify. Think I'm too old?
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
Nobody wants to be the fourth. Please go with me.
Yes you are. You always do. It's why we broke up. You always hide behind him.
They're not picking me up until six.
I think this is a big part of growing up. It's losing your spiritual virginity. It's when you finally discover that your parents aren't anything they told you they were. They're even bigger hypocrites than your friends.
But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody.
I'm making you feel like meat?
You break up with me because I won't fuck you.
Jody. Wait.
Thanks for coming back for me.
Hi mom.
Lisa Sherman?
I don't know. Where did you hear that name.
Where are you going?
I want you to come home with me right now, Jody.
EVERYONE JUST KIND OF LOOKED THE OTHER WAY.
Who?
Yes.
THAT'S why he called Mr. Sisler first. He was one of them.
Yeah.
Kenny's aunt?
What?
Hi Mark, Cindy, Ben.
You can have both if you want.
Hey! That was a 3k machine.
Let me just ask you a serious question first.
On our way home, a drunken driver could hit us head on and send us flying through the windshield. Terminate us instantly. We'd never experience what it means to make love.
Rod!
Unfair?!
What, do you work for my boss, dog?
 Oh, shit.
A little early for a delivery.
That's my business.
The guy's a fuckin' moron.
Uh, huh?
...and fair...
...for Andy, I'll tell him I lost a few cartons comin' over  the mountain.
...is as dangerous as you seem to think it is, I'm gettin' my ass as far away from you and it as possible. 
You want cash?
All right, then how about this?
That dog ain't mean.
...town. 
No cell.
Billings?  No, no, no, no, no.  We need to go to McGruder.
No, no, no.
Look...I kinda borrowed the truck from Andy.

Oh, shit.

Get him to stand up, Night Shift.
    Elvis is on ice again.
Don't gimme that "nice job" shit, man! They still got a vanload comin', and what do you got besides an empty...
...-er!

...Shift.
 I should've had that dog bite me.  I would've gotten rabies! Could've went to the hospital, had a pretty nurse!
Oh, shit.  Come on, old...
...wanna give it a try!
Come on...
I made it!
What are you talkin' about?!  I'm the one drivin'!
Gee, you think so?
Shut up!
Yeah, he's a dangerous...
Come on!
Keep still.
 Yeah.
How wonderful for you.
Listen, Arlo...
...Long.  Somethin' about that look in his eye when he talked about that Elvis...
Bullshit.  You would've killed us anyway.

They're takin' off.
We're gonna die!

Okay. 

...to him. 
Go!
Here...
Forty-seven.  You'd better floor it.
Unbe-fucking-lievable.
Shoot me. 

...another way  outta here.    Hey.
Got it?   Come on, darlin'.  I gotcha.
We're the shit.  Bigtime.
...truck that kept Elvis cool?
Us.  Owes us.
Thank you very much.
...-tiatin'.
No.
It all started with our mission in Istanbul.
My code name was Blackjack.  Night Shift was my coach.  Uh-Uh-Uh, I'm sorry. Mason was my coach.
Uh, he handled rackets, and I carried the balls.
 you see, that was a-that was my mission.
Be cool.  Be--
Give it to me now, or you'll be dead...
Your move.  Okay, Vaughn, you drive.
Funny situation, ain't it, Andy?

Vaughn.
Well, that just about figures for today.
...take my sorry old truck.
So you called the damned thing Elvis
You got a prob-...
Well, why don't they talk to the sage of Jerome here?!
Listen, deputy.
What?  Say again...
All right, gentlemen. We're about done here.  Fine job.
We do have to take into consideration that, through your courage...
Exactly.
...to take any extreme measures I deem necessary...
Colonel Vitelli.  We got a busted-in cold vault inside.
Looks like it.  Yes, sir.
And I changed the schedule.
...-lar.
...here, and the White House is screaming about chemical weapons,  and we're...
Damn you, Long!  My people are out there! Your people are out there!
...always done, Richard?
And let me guess.  You failed.
Good to see you again, Leo.
...maybe even Salt Lake, not to mention Casper...

 Move.  This is already affecting our schedule.

All right.  Tell the pilot we'll be a half-hour.
Carl!  Set up the camera.
Vaughn.
I'm on it.
Richard Long.
Yes, Captain Brynner, you did, but-but--
...what, Sam?  Can't I go down to the loading dock for a few hours without coming back to find a major...
You don't think it's that bad, do you, sir?  I mean, Long's spent the last two years developing his defoliant.  The stuff can't even kill crabgrass yet.

And I can't guarantee the end will be quick.
...and unharmed, de-...


Dead, last time I...

...-son.  Of all the days for you to show up late.  First, the idiot April calls in sick.  Then I got a bad tooth...
Yeah?
...somehow. 

Video lock.
Hit it...
Great.  All right...

Is Elvis out?
The sooner you get up the lab, the sooner you'll figure it out.
...-five.
There's nothin' goin' on out there, doc...except maybe the occasional fly fisherman.
Hey, doc.  Might wanna...

How can we ever hope to win against the trout?
The compound has to be kept cold...
Cold?  Cold.  How cold?
You're the only one I can trust.
And only then does our noble friend realize...
Where are you now...
If you're not out of there soon, I have got to seal the...
Nope.  Is there a prob-...
So you don't remember...
Lying? 
...stole a truck under arrest.
 Listen, Pappas...
...side!
Okay, doc.
Get in 

 Talk to me.
Uh, so head for the other end of the tunnel.
I'll stay here and secure this position.
...gotta seal it.
Negative.  Negative.
An honest living.
How come all these new names are pasted into the plat book?
If you were a bank president that would be one thing, but in your business it's admirable. And it's good advertising.
But I'm surprised you're still working for her, unless she's suddenly come up with another husband.
Fine, as long as you don't serve chicken that way.
They're calling it an accident.
'Course I'm respectable. I'm old. Politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough. I'll double whatever your fees are and I'll pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find Hollis' girlfriend.
No.
I've got the photographs in my office. If they'll help you remember. What was the argument about?
Well... she's an extremely jealous person. I didn't want her to find out about the girl.
An obituary column... can you read in this light?
Gee, this is a surprise, Mr. Gittes.
Sure thing.
Forget it. How would you like to pay me off by taking a couple of passengers to Ensenada... you'd have to leave tonight.
That's a filthy habit.
How do they do that?
Thanks, Lou.
You've done well by yourself.
I'd like to talk to him.
I don't want it anymore.
No. It was an accident.
No, he drowned a cousin of mine with about five hundred other people. But they weren't very important, just a bunch of dumb Mexicans living by a dam. Now beat it, Gittes, you don't come out of this smelling like a rose, you know.
Yeah, I took 'em. So what?
Absolutely.
Mrs. Mulwray, it's a very serious offense pointing that at an officer of the law. It's a felony.
Get him away from her. He's responsible for everything. Get him away from her!
It looks like he was washed the entire length of the runoff channel. Could he swim?
But I thought you'd hired a private investigator.
That's not his apartment.
Well, that little girlfriend, she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course.  She's disappeared. Maybe they disappeared together somewhere.
Thank you for going along with me. I just didn't want to explain anything... I'll send you a check.
I think so. Something besides your husband's death was bothering you. You were upset but not that upset.
My husband.
You'll have to explain that, Mrs. Mulwray.
Is there anything else you want to know?
I can't tell you.
How did it happen?
Your father is Julian Cross, isn't he?
You've got one going, Mrs. Mulwray.
Over the water department, or over you?
Oh, yeah?
What are you thinking?
Know him?
Easy, it's an innocent question.
Working for the District Attorney.
...No. Why was it.
The Albacore Club.
I know.
It's possible.
You know what I mean. You're keeping her there against her will.
I took your husband's Buick...  I'll return it tomorrow.
Did you get some sleep?
Did you have lunch? Kyo will fix you something.
J. J. Gittes for Lieutenant Escobar
Don't worry. I can recommend a couple. They're expensive but you can afford it.
Yes positively. That's where he was drowned...
There's no time for you to be shocked by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water. Just take my word for it. Now I want to know how it happened and why. I want to know before Escobar gets here because I want to hang onto my license.
I said I want the truth.
Hollis came and took... care of me... after she was born... he said... he took care of her... I couldn't see her... I wanted to but I couldn't... I just want to see her once in a while... take care of her... that's all...  but I don't want her to know... I don't want her to know...
That's worse... Just get out of here. Walk out, leave everything.
...where does Kyo live?
On his day off. Get the exact address.
Sophie, go to the little girl's room for a minute.
Jesus Christ, this guy's really got water on the brain.
Well, I'm a working girl, Mr. Gittes. I didn't come in to see you on my own.
Who?
After all, you work with a man for a certain length of time, you come to know him, his habits, his values, and so forth. Well either he's the kind who chases after women or he isn't.
Relax, Mulvihill, glad to see you.  Do you know Claude Mulvihill here?
I don't understand.
Mr. Gittes, you're not making a bit of sense.
Mr. Gittes! That's an outrageous accusation.  I don't know what you're talking about.
Wait. Please sit down, Mr. Gittes. We're... well, we're not anxious for this to get around, but we have been diverting a little water to irrigate avocado and walnut groves in the northwest valley. As you know, the farmers there have no legal right to our water, and since the drought we've had to cut them off. The city comes first, naturally.  But, well, we've been trying to help some of them out, keep them from going under. Naturally when you divert water you get a little runoff.
You're a married man, am I right?
Mr. Gittes?
Come again?
Of course not.
This type of investigation can be hard on your pocketbook, Mrs. Mulwray. It takes time.
Never heard of 'em... new owners?
Lot of turnover these days. Better tell them to get in touch with me if they want to hang onto their land.
Gittes.
He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.
Mulwray? I thought you said Cross owned the department.
What about?
Jesus Christ, Walsh. That's what you spent your day doing?
Yeah?
Duffy, go over and sit on Mulvihill.  Jesus Christ, I didn't tell you to bring the police department with you.
I told my mother you weren't the one who gave me the films. That it wasn't your fault. But I thought you said the film could catch fire just to scare me. Now that I know, I won't steal any more from you. That's all I wanted to say. I'm going. 
Now listen to what I've got to say. I took up this profession when I was ten years old. In those days there weren't these modern machines. The films were silent. The projectors were run by hand, like this, with a crank. And you wound the crank all day long. It was really rough going! If you got tired and slowed down' boom! Everything would go up in flames!
With time...you get used to it. Besides, when you hear from up here that there's a full house and that people are laughing, having fun... Then you're happy too.  So I've been wasting my breath? You pretend to agree with me, but as soon as my back is turned, you do what you want!  Get out of here! I don't want to lay eyes on you again! This is the last straw! Your mother's right, you're crazy!!  But how'd he do it? The little bastard! By watching, he's learned! It's incredible!  I'm letting the box office know you're not to set foot even into the theatre! There are no more tickets for you! And I'm also talking to Father Adelfio! You won't be an altar boy any more either!!! You little runt! 
How's school?
What'd I tell you? It doesn't catch fire!
Chaplin's Modern Times! Right, Toto?
You 're thinner...You can tell you've not been treated well. .
Good morning, father. It's hard on the feet, huh?
You have a great future as a driver. If they don't arrest you first!!
Elena!...But when...
No, Salvatore. You'd better go. It's my father.
He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me.
I saw your daughter. She's beautiful! Who knows how many Salvatores must be running after her...
It's the first time I've had to chance to tell the story. I never mentioned it to anybody.
Oh, how I looked for you, Elena! You'll never know. I wrote, telephoned, nothing. Nobody ever answered. But I dreamt of you for years! That's why I went away...and never came back here.  Even as the years passed, in all the women I met, I was only looking for you. I had success it's true, but there was always something missing...  I'd never have imagined that all this had to end because of the man who was like a father to me. A crazy lunatic! 
No...It's nothing to do with you. It's just that I was scared of coming back. Now, after all these years, I thought I was strong, that I had forgotten lots of things. Instead, I find it's quite the opposite, as if I had never left. And yet, I look at Lia and feel as if I didn't know her, and you, Mamma...I abandoned you, ran away like a thief, thought only of myself, and never gave you an explanation...
That's all right.  We have no secrets from our readers.  Mr. Thatcher is one of our most devoted readers, Mr. Bernstein.  He knows what's wrong with every issue since I've taken charge. What's the cable?
Hey, Brad!  Brad!  He ain't been drinking before, Mr. Kane. Never.  We would have heard.
"Miss Susan Alexander, a pretty but hopelessly incompetent amateur -  - last night opened the new Chicago Opera House in a performance of - of -"  I can't pronounce that name, Mr. Kane.
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein.  I'm dictating it.
It's wonderful, Mr. Kane.  Wonderful. Wonderful.
He's a great guy - Leland.  Why'd he ever leave New York?
Yes.  I thought it was a good idea. We've covered it from the news end, of course.
Oh, yes, it's already made up.  Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review.
From before the beginning, young fellow. And now it's after the end.  Anything you want to know about him - about the paper -
Thatcher!  That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met -
Maybe that was something he lost. Mr. Kane was a man that lost - almost everything he had -  You ought to talk to Bradford Leland. He could tell you a lot.  I wish I could tell you where Leland is, but I don't know myself.  He may be out of town somewhere - he may be dead.
Isn't it wonderful?  Such a party!
What's happened?
If you hadn't come along and protected me when you did, I'd have killed them fellows.
You may resume your work, gentlemen.  I didn't know your plans and so I was unable to make any preparations.
Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein. Mr. Bernstein is my general manager.
But a morning newspaper, Mr. Kane. After all, we're practically closed twelve hours a day - except for the business offices -
Maybe you can do it and maybe you can't, Mr. Kane.
Emily!
I know that, Emily -
I know it is, Brad -
What's this all about, Emily?  I've had a very tiring day and -
I suppose so, but - I'm not afraid of the story.  You can't tell me that the voters of this state -
Charles, if you don't listen to reason, it may be too late -
I can't tell you the things he said, Charlie.  You haven't got any idea -
If you want to come in and wash your face -  I can get you some hot water to get that dirt off your trousers -
Where's the soap?
Where's the towel?
No.  That is, I bet it turns out I've heard your name a million times, only you know how it is -
You've been wonderful!  I can't tell you how glad I am you're here, I don't know many people and - 
I didn't run into you and I bet they're not your Sunday clothes. You've probably got a lot of clothes.
Is that what you want to do?
What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?
Yes -
I'll discuss what's on my mind when I want to.  You're not going to keep on running my life the way you want it.
Well, I'm not going to stop it.  I'm going to say exactly what I think.  You've never given me anything.  You've tried to buy me into giving you something.  You're -  - it's like you were bribing me!  That's what it's been from the first moment I met you.  No matter how much it cost you - your time, your money - that's what you've done with everybody you've ever known.  Tried to bribe them!
You'll never have another chance to hit me again.  I never knew till this minute -
I won't let you go.
Let's not start all over again, Charlie.  We've said everything that can be said.
Anything you say, Mr. Kane.  Only we're talking now about what you are.  That's what the note is about, Mrs. Kane.  Now I'm going to lay all my cards on the table.  I'm fighting for my life.  Not just my political life.  My life.  If your husband is elected governor -
You're making a bigger fool of yourself than I thought you would, Mr. Kane.  You're licked.  Why don't you -
You see!  There hasn't been a true word -
Get Dr. Corey.
Mrs. Kane would like to see you, Mr. Kane.
Raymond - 
Well, gentlemen, are we going to war?
Why not?
They're true!  Everything I said! Witholding that veto was treason!
Charlie!  Now you're not making sense.
All right.
I don't think so, Brad.  We've just had word that the President is out of danger.  It seems I didn't kill him after all.
Sure I am.  She wants full custody of the child no matter what happens. If you won't agree to that, she'll apply for a divorce regardless of the President's wishes.  I can't tell her she's wrong, because she isn't wrong -
There's no reason why this - this savage personal note -
You still want to be transferred to the other paper?
Hello, Brad.
Maybe we'd better wait for more word on the President's condition.
We'll withdraw support completely. Anything else?
What check?
Well, let's hope it's all for the best.
You're going to live with Mr. Thatcher from now on, Charlie!  You're going to be rich.  Your Ma figures - that is, er - she and I have decided that this isn't the place for you to grow up in. You'll probably be the richest man in America someday and you ought to -
Sorry, Mr. Leland.
Oh, yes.  I know about Mr. Rawlston.
I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim.
Where do I sign, Mr. Thatcher?
Hold this thing up for a week.  Two weeks if you have to...
You can go on asking questions if you want to.
What do you think all that is worth, Mr. Thompson?
How did you meet him?
They haven't been tough on me.  I just lost my money.  But when I compare these last ten years with the twenty I spent with him -
Right away.  Will you have something, Mr. Thompson?
She's just not talking to anybody from the newspapers, Mr. Thompson.
She's plastered, isn't she?
I'll come down in a week or so and see her again.  Say, you might be able to help me.  When she used to talk about Kane - did she ever happen to say anything - about Rosebud?
How long have you been smoking?
I'd say you're about nineteen, twenty, am I right?
That's your lung. By this time, your lung looks like this.
It's not the same.
Jesus!
Pack of cigarettes.  What's that?
Beats me.
Maybe you should take that coffee outside.
If you're going to drink it in here, I'd appreciate it if you'd not bother the customers.
I think you'd better leave now.
Yeah, but not in here.
God, isn't he great?
I was here the whole time.
When did you get back?
You're just going to lock the store like that?
You saw it?
It's not what you think.
I was going to tell you. But then we were getting along so well, I didn't want to mess it up.
The story goes like this: He proposed, and I told him I had to think about it, and he insisted I wear the ring anyway. Then my mother told the paper we were engaged.
No, I wasn't. Not really. I told you'd I'd been seeing other people.
I don't want to marry him. I don't want to get married now. I'm on the verge of graduation. I want to go to grad school after this. And then I want to start a career. I don't want to be a wife first, and then have to worry about when I'm going to fit in all of the other stuff.  I've come way too far and studied too hard to let my education go to waste as a housewife. And I know that's what I'd become. Sang's already signed with a major firm, and he's going to be pulling a huge salary, which would give me no reason to work, and he's so traditional anyway...
Look how full of yourself you are.
I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that.
It's just the shock of seeing me after three years. Believe me, you'll get over it.
The key word here is talk, Dante. I think the idea, the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date.
How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on the Boardwalk, Then Get Naked Somewhere Kind of Private Date?
Sang.
He's not invited.
I offer you my body and you offer me semantics? He's just a boyfriend, Dante, and in case you haven't gotten the drift of why I came all the way here from Ohio, I'm about to become single again.  And yes-let me placate your ego-you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision, for which I'll probably be ostracized at both school and home. You ask me who I choose, I choose you.
You're such an asshole.
I can already tell this isn't going to work.
Where'd he go?  I'd have thought he'd be at your side, like an obedient lapdog.
Well, me I guess.  So, I shall take my leave of you, but I will return in a little while, at which time-yes-I would love to go for dinner and a movie with you.
When you just lie perfectly still and let me do everything.
And the fact that there weren't any lights made it so...  God! That was so great!
This isn't fucking funny, Dante!
Are you open?
What the fuck is this?! I want some service!
Who are you to make assessments?
That's easy to say from over here.
Are you open?
I'M GONNA BREAK YOUR FUCKING HEAD! YOU FUCKING JERKOFF!
Well, he missed!
Pack of cigarettes.  Cute cat. What's its name?
The boss called. Arthur fell ill.
That's what I said.
You don't want to know.
Five years.
In the middle of it, she calls me Brad.
She called me Brad.
I hit the lights and she freaks. Turns out she thought I was Brad Michaelson.
Allan Harris.
Because there was a lot of good in our relationship.
I'm serious. Aside from the cheating, we were a great couple.  That's what high school's all about-algebra, bad lunch, and infidelity.
Didn't you hear me? Caitlin really is getting married.
Empire.
Yeah.
It would stand to reason, yes.
You know what else I noticed in Jedi?
So they build another Death Star, right?
She's in here?
It's not like you laid the eggs yourself.
Did you ever notice all the prices end in nine? Damn, that's eerie.
Which ones?
Can you come next door? I gotta make a phone call.
Vermont?
That seems to be the leitmotif in your life; ever backing down.
Yes, you do. You always back down. You assume blame that isn't yours, you come in when called as opposed to enjoying your day off, you buckle like a belt.
See? There you go again.
At least we're stuck here together.
He's blunt, but he's got a point.
Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want something to drink? 
What happened to all the Gatorade?
After an exhausting game like that I can believe it.
How? When?
Number six.
Stop it. This is beneath even you.
Don't be an asshole. Somebody has to stay with the store.
His dick was in his mouth?
He made it, hunhh?
You know.
I know it was a bad idea to close the store.
What?
I like to expand my horizons.
No way!
What did she say?
What happened to title dictates behavior?
There's no lights back there.
You just fucked a total stranger?
You should shit or get off the pot.
Yeah, you should shit or get off the pot.
You date Veronica because she's low maintenance and because it's convenient. Meanwhile, all you ever do is talk about Caitlin. You carry a torch for a girl you dated in high school-in high school for God's sake! You're twenty-two!
Make them change.
So you'll continue being miserable all the time, just because you don't have the guts to face change?
Why do you say that?
No, really. What did I do that was so wrong?
How do you figure?
It's not like I'm miles away.
How many times I gotta tell you not to deal outside the store.
Noinch, noinch, noinch-smoking weed, smoking weed! Doing coke!  Drinking beers!  A pack of wraps, my good man. It's time to kick back, drink some beers, and smoke some weed!
Listen to you. Oh shit. "Oh, I don't hang out with drug dealers."
All right. How much is Pepsi here?
I don't know dude. That Caitlin chick's nice. But I see that Veronica girl doing shit for you all the time. She brings you food, she rubs your back... Didn't I see her change your tire one day?
Damn. She sure goes out of her way.
It's not like it's a demanding job. I'd like to get paid to sit on my ass and watch TV. The other day I walked in there and that sonofabitch was sleeping.
You calling me a liar?
What the hell is that? Resting his eyes! It's not like he's some goddamned air traffic controller!
Such a wiseass. But go ahead. Crack wise. That's why you're jockeying a register in some fucking local convenience store instead of doing an honest day's work.  I got no more time to bullshit around waiting for that sonofabitch.  You make sure this gets back. The number's eight-twelve-Wynarski. And I wanted to get a damn movie, too.
The white kind.
Yeah, but...
You know, you probably could've been home, already, in the time it's taken you to get in there.
I said go ahead.
Here. Now leave me alone.
All right, stupid question. But don't you think you're taking this a bit too hard?
Why did you agree to come in then?
Honesty through paranoia. Why do you smell like shoe polish?
Oh, you think so?
I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan, it takes more than that to get a guy off. Just "being there"-as you put it-is not enough.
I'm astonished to hear you trivialize my role in our sex life.
Do I get to hit you after you tell me?
Wow. That's great. That's something to be proud of.
All right. Name it.
Shit! Why are we getting up?
Oh my God-I feel so nauseous...
HOW MANY?
What the hell is that anyway, "something like thirty-six?" Does that include me?
I'M THIRTY-SEVEN?
A few?
I feel sick.
What did he say?
Of course not; not now! You're caught, and now you're trying to snake out of doing what you wanted to do. Well, I won't let you. I want you to follow through on this, just so you can find out what a fucking idiot you are. And when she dumps you again- and she will, Dante, I promise you that-when she dumps you again, I want to laugh at you, right in your face, just so you realize that that was what you gave up our relationship for!  I'm just glad Randal had the balls to tell me, since you couldn't.
A fine, for five hundred dollars.
What are you talking about?
Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!
Oh shit, look who it is. The human vacuum.
He only speaks Russian?
To a five-year-old kid? What a scumbag!
I just held up the same two movies. You're not even paying attention.
Till ten. Then I'm going to John K's party.
I'm not sad.
No, I'm more furious. I'm pissed off. I feel like he's been killing time while he tries to grow the balls to tell me how he really feels, and then he can't even do it!  He has his friend do it for him!
The guy ain't here yet.
Like hell you are!
Willam!
A monkey?
That was the first and last question-- now only answers. Where's the chopper?
Looks like the Tower.  It's a bad climb.
Glad you could drop in.
Remember, keep your arms and legs within the vehicle at all times--
Now let me fill you in.  You can get your ass back down an' go back to that hole you been hiding in--
Take the gun.
Can I count as fast as I like?
There you go.
Four...five...
You can stop right there.
Where've you been?
Where?
Can't do it?  I don't believe this.  Don't you feel anything?
Gabe!?
Looking for Hal.  Oh my God, I heard someone kick the door open...you came back.
Frank dropped me in the west valley and I hiked.  You look frozen.  What's happening?!
It was great.
We have to get through to the other side.  You up for it?
Gabe!  Are you alright?
Can you see light?
Gabe!
Take the rope.
Look here, the mountain man. You're Walker, right?
What the fuck you mean you burned it?
For Christ's sake, they're kids.
No, the goddamn game's not over! It's never over when you're playing against a team that doesn't care if they win or lose-- how do you negotiate with someone like that?!
Yeah...
I don't know about totally.
Calm down...give the gun to me. You're out of control, son.
Travers!  Hurry it up.
I don't trust him.
Bring down the money or your friend's dead!
Man against nature, right Travers.
He's alive!
Good, Travers.  It might catch on, like shooting skeet.
Is it set?
Mostly.  Armored cars can be hijacked.  Trains can be derailed.  But nobody can get to us in flight.
I think Treasury personnel are the most superstitious people in the federal government.
Hello Lucy, had a busy night? Puts money in machine.
Pardon me. Luce. He raises glass to breast, pulls red handle between her legs. Milk spurts into glass. Dim joins the others. Alex looks at a party of tourists.
Yarbles, great bolshy yarblockos to you I'll meet you with chain, or nozh or britva, any time, not having you aiming tolchocks at me reasonless. It stands to reason, I won't have it.
Been cured, yeah, that was read out to us. The Inspector read all that out to us. He said it was a very good way.
Great, sir. Great.
Thank you very much, sir. Cheers Suddenly the thought occurs to Alex that the wine may be drugged or poisoned.
Help you.
Excuse me, missus, can you please help? There's been a terrible accident. Can I please use your telephone for an ambulance?
Yes, sir. I suppose you might call it that, sir.
Fine, sir, fine.
Thank you very much, sir.
Eeee... I'll put your breakfast in the oven. I've got to be off myself now.
Why didn't you let us know what was happening, son?
Oh, or certainly by this evening, yes? The evening's a great time, isn't it, Alex boy?
I've just come back from the hospital. Your victim has died.
We got worried. There we were waiting and drinking away at the old knify Moloko and you had not turned up and we thought you might have been like offended by something or other, so around we come to your abode.
Good. Real horrorshow. Initiative comes to them as waits. I've taught you much, my little droogies. Now tell me what you have in mind, Georgie Boy.
Good.
Good evening, my boy.
Helping you, sir?
Hullo lad. What a surprise, good to see you.
What about Basil? Where's my snake?
What do I want?
Oh. Oh, you're sorry are you, well you must think I'm awfully stupid. He slaps Alex in the face.
You want to know why I did that, well you see - I do that... He stamps on Alex's foot.
Have you ever had any mental illness?
No, sir.
Indeed it is. May I take this She removes his tray.
I realise all that, Missus, and I'm very grateful to all concerned.
Are you referring to the background score?
Patients who've sustained the kind of injuries you have often have dreams of this sort. It's all part of the recovery process.
Good. It wa your fault... you sold me a crummy watch. I want my money back.
And when do I get out of here then?
You're keen on music?
You must take your chance boy. The choice has been all yours.
And, Father, I've never been guilty of any institutional infractions, have I?
I don't care about the danger, Father. I just want to be good. I want for the rest of my life to be one act of goodness.
I wonder where exactly is it he goes to work of evenings.
Well, it's a surprise all right, a bit bewildering too.
How many to a cell?
The Bowery, you gotta deal with runoff from two bridges.
Sure.  I'm starting an 800 hotline.  Caught part of your phone call.  And even if I hadn't, there's the dark pinstripe, Armani, elegant, not too hip, which rules out advertising, plus a top-of-the-line briefcase that you live out of, looks like Bottega...
Soon.  But I take little ones all the time.  Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean.
Listen to me!  Just listen, okay? There's a man, Vincent, he's coming to kill you!
...he's two floors below you.
He doesn't know you're up there!  Just stay right where you are!  Call the police!
...I was just a young cat back then, about nineteen, bussin' tables in this very place.  Didn't pay but shit, but that wasn't the point.  Being around the music, that was the thing.  And I was.  Take this one night...July 22, 1964...who walks in?  Mr. Louis Armstrong.
Remember what you played?
The crowd had to dig it.
You know Dmitri?
And here I was thinking you were such a nice guy.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
What?  What did you say?
You think I wanted to come here tonight?  You think I'm that stupid? Sometimes shit happens, you gotta roll with it.
You guys been holding hands?
What if they're wrong?
Happy to meet you, Mrs. Rilke.
It's nothing.
I'm in town for a short time.
Hi, Ma.
You're kidding me.
...oh God, don't shoot me...
He'll keep calling.
...what do you want me to do, punch him out?  I have to work with him...
Twenty-four?  Not twenty-five?  Or twenty-three?
Mind if I time you?  What do I get if you're wrong?  A free ride?
It's home.
You know, this is the cleanest cab I've ever been in.  This your regular ride?
You should start a union.
Like what?
He fell on my cab!  From up th-th-there.
Good.  Help me out here.
I'm gonna roll him off the hood. Always lift with your legs...
Got it?
Try harder.  I'm gonna count to three. One...
Try some deep breathing.
What are you doing?
Listen.  I'm not trying to piss you off, see?  Okay?  I can't drive you around so you can murder folks.
Music.
I didn't throw him, he fell.
Nothing.  I only met him the one time.
Who's that?
So what?
Lenny?  You're an asshole.
Another collateral.
Collateral damage.
But, hey, some good news.  This last one put me way ahead of schedule. We've actually got some time to kill.  Jazz?  You like jazz?
...see now, this has got a little post- war flavor, a little Miles thing happening.  Awesome.  What do you think?
What you mean, no?
Mom, Vincent's not interested.
You take one more step, I'll kill her.
What the fuck was <u>that?</u>
He hated everything I did.  Hated me. Got drunk and beat the shit out of me, daily...
Don't be.  I never saw him after I was 15.  Went into the military early.  So all this talk about "my job's temporary, I got big plans," it's all bullshit.
What do <u>you</u> call it?  Ten years doesn't sound temporary to me.  I should have known it was bullshit, you're too good at what you do.
I'll just hold onto it for you.  In case they check.
Our friends in Little Russia.  Go in and ask for a man named Dmitri.
No client has ever seen my face, and I intend to keep it that way.  Besides, if he decides to put a bullet in my head, I don't wanna be there for it.
Vincent.  Don't make me do this. Don't make me get people killed.
How long have you been a hit man?
You get benefits?
Damn, Max.  I'm impressed.  Really.  I would have bet good money you wouldn't walk out of there.
Washington and Holt.  Dance club called "Fever." Know it?
What holds you back, Max?  Tell me. Why does life scare you so much?
Who's Heller?
<u>I'm</u> full of shit?  You're a monument of bullshit.  You even bullshitted yourself all I am, is taking out the garbage.  Bad guys killing bad guys...
As in...? 
Slow the hell down!
Love gives you wings.  It makes you fly.  I don't even call it love.  I call it Geronimo.
Are you crazy?!
<u>Jerry</u>?  You didn't show last night.  First time ever.  Had me worried, boy.
Flip.  You're the closest thing I got to a friend around here.  Tell me something.  You think I'm crazy?
You going to warn him?
You think I'm crazy.
Just relax.
People do have heart attacks.
It's okay.  The guy traded bullets with some old man in a liquor store.  He had it coming.
Crown Victoria.  F.B.I. car.  A legitimate tail.
People more serious about their work. You know how to drive this thing or do you just like looking good in it?
How long have we known each other, Jerry?
Well that's the eye right there. <u>Money</u>.  And all the power and misery it brings with it. It's a plot to take over the world.  The Master Conspiracy. Can take a lifetime to pull off.
So why are they after you?
So I'm a little jumpy.  Who wouldn't be?
You want something to drink?
Equitation.
You're a Holden Caulfield fan.
What are you doing?
You run with your back to the picture.  Like you were trying to get away.  Once in awhile you sing along with music, but mostly you punish yourself.
Never mind.  You'd think I was making it up.
I put an ad on a computer bulletin board.  I log on at the library so I can't be traced.
Elaborate on 'they,' okay?
Cold War's over, Jerry.
Sure. One of the richest men in America until he died a few days ago.
I see the big picture and you stumble around in the details.
They don't break in the summer! Do you know what building is right over this spot?  Harriman Tower. Their sub-basement was flooded! He didn't die in a pool.  Call the coroner in Rhode Island!  Ask if the water in his lungs was chlorinated!
You're wrong.  Since I met you, I don't dream about holes anymore.
What is it?
Connecticut.
What about them?
John Hinkley.  The guy who shot Reagan.  He only had two names.
Is that what they told you?
Did you kill my father?!
Jerry.  Please.  You don't understand.  I have to know.  It's all I think about.  Do you have any idea what it's like not to know?
<u>Why not, Jerry</u>?
How'd you get the picture?
I love you, too.
Who have you been talking to, Jerry?  Who else knows what you know?
We've arranged for you to take the blame.  Everyone knows how you've been harassing the poor girl.
You should think of me as Liza Sutton's guardian angel.
I'm not a violent man, Mr. Lowry. Not by nature, anyhow.  But if you hurt Liza in any way, I'll kill you.  Does that seem honorable?
You made your decision yet?
That's not what I mean.  I want to see her.
If you're as impressed to see me as I am to see you, you're very impressed indeed.  How's Jerry feeling this morning?
We experimented with hallucinogens.  We used electro- shock to produce a vegetative state.  We conducted terminal experiments in sensory deprivation.
Jerry told me he bit your nose.
Where'd you get it?
Hmm, how about tomorrow night?
Night after that?
We're waiting for jurisdictional problems to be cleared up.  This guy Fletcher's something else.
I want to believe you, too.
I'm, it really doesn't matter. Think C.I.A. and exponentiate. I'm a government employee and I've been watching Jerry for awhile.
We have benzel activation, repeat, we have benzel activation.  Control to Arroway, you okay in there?  Repeat, Control to Arroway, come back.
There's no plug to pull.
You don't believe it to be... tell me something, Doctor.  Why do you think they would go to all this trouble... bring you tens of thousands of light years, and then send you home without a shred of proof?  Sort of bad form, wouldn't you say?  What was their intent?
Mike, because of the Earth's rotation we're only in line with Vega so many hours a day; the only way to get the whole message is to cooperate with other stations.  If Dr. Arroway hadn't moved quickly we could have lost key elements.
I'm sorry, Miss Arroway, not only is it too Speculative a subject for a doctoral dissertation, at this point in your career it'd be tantamount to suicide.
Two:  There's nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and you'd be wasting your time.
You know why I'm here.
Ellie, I should have done this a long time ago, certainly before I left the N.S.F., but I wanted to give you every benefit of the doubt --
It's not like you've given me much choice.
Then why haven't you detected any signals?  If, as you claim, there have been thousands, millions of advanced civilizations out there for millions of years then why hasn't one signal gotten through?  It'll take a month or two for the paperwork to go through; you're welcome to stay until then.
... Arrangements also have to be made for the V.I.P.s coming in, mostly religious leaders...
What is it?  What's happened?
You mean --
David --
I'm asking for your help, David.  I want to go.  They'll need someone relatively young, unattached -- and probably a scientist.  As the President's Science Advisor you have enormous weight... I'm asking if you'll support my candidacy.
Right.  Well.
Because you cut it from the budget three years running.
Dr. Lunacharsky...?
Dr. Cullers?
Ellie.  Pulsar?
You've only searched -- what is it, sixteen hundred stars without a peep?  Try not to take it too personally.
Can't we get rid of them?
Colonel Jarrod, I'd like a twenty mile radio-silent perimeter put around this installation immediately.
... I don't understand it.  All I can think is that maybe because the video gear wasn't accounted for in the original plans it somehow violated the integrity of the design.
Time to sleep now, Captain.  But you can ask more questions in the morning, okay?
And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built.
So who...?
Eventually you'll get here on your own.  This was just the first step; in time you'll take another.
Some kind of circuitry...?
A machine.  But a machine that does what?
A sunrise and a sunset every forty- five minutes.
What's that?
... Drumlin said you're been down at Arecibo for the last year.
Please.  Any chance of that died the day David Drumlin was appointed head of the N.S.F.  I have been in contact with a few other SETI people; we've been trying to find backing from private investors. I've even managed to scrounge a couple of hours of telescope time here and there...
Peter -- if you can get him to do that for me he'd obviously do the same for you -- we could -- !
But the work --
Ellie.
Someone tell me this is really happening.
Thank God.  When we lost contact, I thought -- we thought... but you're okay.  We're still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction.  Did you notice anything at all that --
I flinched.
Look, I'm a reasonable person, and reasonably intelligent.  But this experience went beyond both.  For the first time I had to consider the possibility that intellect, as wonderful as it is, is not the only way of comprehending the universe. That it was too small and inadequate a tool to deal with what it was faced with.
Relativity.  Explain this to me one more time... even if you traveled near the speed of light, when you came back --
I thought it was well-written. Heart-felt.  And a little bit naive... But that's just the enemy's perspective.
... Another question I would ask would be a very simple one.  How did you do it?  How did you evolve as far as you have and not destroy yourselves?
So.  The final countdown.
Ellie, what is it?
I'm in love with you, Ellie.
I'm assuming you read my deposition.
You're sure you want to?  In the universe I saw we're not exactly the stars of the show.  What happened to me makes us all seem pretty damn small.
You kill me, you really do.  The first truly global, a-political event in history and you can't wait to spin it.
Well.  That would seem to decide it. Like it or not, for the moment, anyway, it looks like we're all in this together.
How'd you find me?
Like to oblige you, Arletta, but right off I don't know where to put my hands on 'em.
You never thought that's a heavy load?
Yeah.
We saw the broads.
What's all this dirt in the yard?
You got your mind right, Luke?
You cut that up fer lunch, Luke.
I guess you could say I wasn't thinkin', Captain.
That's right, Captain. Just passin' the time.
That ain't nuthing compared to what we used to do in San Pedro. There was this ensign...
Whatcha got?
He ain't eating beans fer lunch.
Oh lookit that brunette.
A cold drink.
A cold drink? Okay?
Somebody say somethin'?
Whatta you so happy about?
Plumb busted out. Looks like the hard road finally got to Mister Lucas War Hero.
Course not. He ain't in the box 'cause a the joke played on him. He's there 'cause he back sassed a Free Man. They got their rules and we ain't got nothing to do with that. Woulda probably happened to him sooner or later, to a complainer like him. He's gotta learn the rules same as anybody else.
Slow down, man. They ain't passing out medals for slinging dirt.
Damn, Luke. What's the matter with you? what's the matter with me?
Whoee, it's cold. Wisht I had somethin' to eat. Bread, grits, beans even. Soon's we get to my house, we're gonna have us one big meal and then I'm gonna show you some farm girls that...
Luke. Where you goin?
Not a liar. You just have a common -- and likable -- tendency toward exaggeration.
Oh Lord!
A bunch. Must be halfa dozen Newmeat.
Man! It's gonna be one hot muther today.
I gotta believe. Out!  Now they're rollin'.  King-five-four gets an eight.  Pair'a nines with a Jack gets a four. Ninas still up.
Oh no, man! Not on this hot muther.
But -- but --
You ain't man enough to wear them!
Excuse me, but would you mind explaining why you're watching the lady upstairs?
I've told you:  I can't afford to garage it.
I had the dream again.  And I got another call.  This time he spoke.  He said "You and me, you and me."
Oh, God.  I must have looked horrible.
What?  What'd I do?
Yes.  Without question.
The first two murders.
You don't listen very good.  This break in -- I can call it a felony -- three strikes, and you got about sixteen strikes already, and you're in jail for the rest of your life, no parole.  Or I could see it gets forgotten.
Where did you send the message to Peter Kurten?
You like that action?  Didn't that cop on TV look <u>solemn</u>?  The guy in the basement doesn't matter, anyway, just another lonely heart.
Yes.  I do.  I want it to end now. Let her go.  I'll come -- just let her go.  She's not important.
Ring the gong, he goes.  Poor impulse control.
I want to tell you it's a great honor to meet you and talk to you.
Why imitate a dead serial killer?
She probably let him in the door without a thought.  Where are their mothers?!  Where are the mothers that are supposed to teach them to be wary and to tough and not afraid to fight?
He comes in the window, we maybe grab him.  Where's the on-switch?
Injected Windex!  Why would he switch to a new m.o.?
Halloran.
They put  Merry <u>Saks</u> on it?!
A man?  I thought he was a boy.  This last Christmas was the happiest Christmas I had in the last ten years... you know why?  It was the first Christmas in six years I was not in love.  Son of a bitch <u>married men</u>!  Who cares about marriage, the bed just gets crowded and noisy?!
Who's the married man?
I am not going to talk about it. How do you <u>know</u> it was Andy if the head was gone?  Where is the head? Are you looking for it?  Oh, God, why him?  Because of me.  I can't talk about it.  I write about things like this, stuff it all in books and bury it in libraries. This is the first person close to me who's ever died.  And it's because of me.  This monster killed him because I loved him.
How many do you need to sleep. Really sheep?
Helen.  I saw him die.  I saw him burning on the basement stairs, he never reached the top.
You were the one that talked about moonbikes and called me a crank? Oh God, I <u>am</u>!  Make them some coffee.  Halloran, is it?  Investigator Goetz?  I had a crank call myself-- he said...  I thought it might be Daryll Lee Cullum.  I thought he might be out of prison.
It's a game they like to play. Berkowitz -- "Son of Sam" -- hung around the crime scene, talking to the cops.  This one's probably watching <u>you</u>, laughing at you.
Yes.
You know how to use this?
You've been very useful, Doctor, we appreciate all you've done, and now the professional will take over...
Hello.  I am  Meryhew Saks.  The song is called "Murder By Numbers."  The performers are a group called The Police.  Adam here... ... from Behavioral Science is working out exactly what this perpetrator is trying to telegraph in the note.  This is an extremely complex case, and we have a lot of fancy theories floating around. We're not ruling out the possib- ility of three Copycat serial killers.  We have Quantico working on graphology, the Washington lap is cloning DNA from the secretor. It's our feeling that the best lead we have is the two sperm samples in one of the victims.  We have a team sweeping sperm banks.  Now I want to say a few word to you local people.  Your Commissioner asked for our assistance.  The Bureau does not send us in on these cases to lord it over the local police. We couldn't catch up on what you people know if we had a year.  We have nation-wide resources and hard state of the art forensic science; you have the local savvy.  Together we can be unbeatable.  Which one is Inspector Halloran?
How come you're so up on Dr. Hudson?
Okay.
It's none of my business anymore...
Don't put yourself down like that. I <u>never</u> used you.  I worked my way up like a marine grunt!
Answer it.
Sure.  She likes <u>you</u>, Rube.  She likes the way you move.  She sure as hell isn't in love with me.
Ruben, my God, I ought to put you on report.
Now listen up, Ruben.  You never, never, never mess with somebody <u>inside</u> the case!
We're gonna have a bunch of clapped out old hippies blissing on the Grateful Dead!  Sleeping in the park, smoking dope and sticking tulips up their ass.
You ever reflect how this big explosion in dead women coincides with the flowering of women's lib?
Christ.  How old are you?  You sure you want to be in this line of work?
Just, I need results.  And -- I am short-handed.  Who else am I gonna give him?
I didn't want the Illigals, I wanted just the bastards dumping them in the harbor.  What's keeping those bums at Immigration?  Nightmare in here...
You want mine, too?  You take his, you take mine.  I'm the one fucked it up...
We were together six years, sir!
She knows I'm Catholic!  She never mentioned divorce!  Not once!
Did you come?
That's going well, then.
The other man, the dead man, his wife is a doctor - Dr. Helen Remington. She's here, somewhere. As a patient, of course. Maybe you'll find her in the hallways tomorrow on your walk.
Do you find him attractive?
You'd better drive him. He's a bit shaky. I'll follow in my car. Where is yours?
I think he'll be waiting for us at the airport
Oh yes. I thought he was a medical photographer, doing some sort of accident research. He wanted every conceivable detail about our crash.
And you had sex with all of these men in cars? Only in cars?
I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?
Crash victim?
Do you live here? With Seagrave?
Do we have to talk about this?
I know Michael's a schizophrenic, and Mrs. Hallstrom's manic- depressive, and John Lockyer has episodes of psychosis, and I heard a rumor that you suffer from delusions of grandeur.
She says she won't even come if Dad brings Monica.
Oh, wait a minute, now I see where you're going.
What do you think of this one?
Yeah, everything's under control.
How can I help?
Fuck me.
You're slowing.
What do you think?
But what am I going to do?
How wonderful, darling.  What does that mean for you?
Are you sure, Dear?
Has Paul heard about his promotion?
Oh no.
Oh, Letty, what happened?
Yes.
It's so good to see you, Sweetheart.
We aren't allowed to wear jewelry in here, Mom.
Mom, we agreed. You can visit, but you're not allowed to mention Michael.
Letty, you should be in bed.
Do you mind if I call you Letitia?
What if it's got a pattern?
John even managed to lob a load of mashed potatoes into Mrs. Hallstrom's milk.
It was romantic.   He's very romantic.
Guess.
For a price.
No.
We'll get caught.
Thanks.    Where've you been all day?
I'm not allowed to see you anymore.
I had to sneak by the guards to get here. They say you're highly unstable, have a depressive personality, and may hold back my own recovery.
Really, though. My thoughts go haywire sometimes.
I wish I could have seen that.
The mission up in Santa Barbara.
I love the pillows.
What do you say we go out to dinner to celebrate?
Gosh, Letty, this is a great place.
The store was busy.
Just promise you'll love me even if I end up in a job where I have to wear a blue polyester cap.
How may I help you?
Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who likes magic?
What?
Don't upset my Mom.     Don't you upset my Mom.
I guess we need to talk.
Like I've told you before I don't want you taking care of me.
But that wasn't me.    I didn't mean to do that.
What are we going to do?
Don't you have a magic trick or something to make this easier?
Can I put these here for tonight?
I was thinking dinner on Friday with James and Meg at the Saint Mark.
Forget I asked.
Are you all right?
I hope it wasn't something I did.
You can tell me anything.  Do you want to postpone the wedding? Is it too much pressure?
What?
I've got a deposition that I really need to get cracking on, so if you don't mind...
Believe me, I wish I'd understood what was going on. I've worked really hard to get better.
All tapped out.
How's it look?
Agent Hadley.
Witness' can be convinced they made a mistake. Without the murder weapon the D.A. won't have enough to prosecute you.
Too many people know about my involvement in this.
They left about a half hour ago.
Jesus.   What kind of FBI agent are you?
Then why not just fuckin' say better than expected? Everybody knows what better than expected means.
And?
Someone else coming?
What is happening with the world? There was a time no civilian would touch a made man. Now every babbo in the world thinks he can get away with something. What did they take?
We've got a lot of people looking for us. We'd just like to go home.
I only ask so I can call you when the arrangements are made.
This plane will take you to Canada. From there you can fly back to Paris.
In English.   Sami doesn't speak French.
Hopefully no one.
I'm going to kill him myself!
Bring me the scissors.
Cut his pants up the leg to the groin.
You think it's smart to tell him we're French?
We had a chance to walk out of Zammito's house.
We still have to get out of here.
After the outside alarm is off we go in through the bedroom window.
They'll be waiting for us at the airport.
It makes sense. I mean, do you really think he would come along if he knew we were being set up?
Hadley --
Okay. Airports, train stations, bus station are out. We know they're connected to the car rental agencies because that's where they picked up Raymond.
No, that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead.
Guns.   Can you get them?
Don't bullshit me.
And, uh, I'm going to have to charge you a commission... kind of like a brokerage fee.
I just thought that--
They were all French guys.
Everything.
Well, you know, when five guys break into my house in the middle of the night, stick guns in my face, tie me up and steal from me... it does irritate me.
What'd you guys find?
You know, a little of this, a little of that. I've boosted cars, stole radios, run a few scams. Right now I'm into pick-pocketing.
This is bad. This is really fuckin' bad. Am I the only one who sees how bad this is?
Oh, man... this is bullshit!    You can't trust anyone these days.
Today's your lucky day, Sami.
Normally I'd be breaking your fingers right now, but I'm going to give you a chance to make enough to pay me back and have some extra for yourself. We have a group going to Chicago to do a job. You're going with them.
It's good.
This is great. After everything we've been through we've got eight hundred euros and an autographed baseball.
Give it to me, Sami.
Anybody know about that car outside?
Oh, Pepe Le Pew. He is very funny and quite well known in France.
How are we going to do that?
I would like to thank you for your hospitality.  If you are ever in Paris here is my number.
The money isn't here.
The new Beaujolais' come out in France next week. You like wine?
It has to be at Sophie's. She didn't have time to go anywhere else before she came here.
When do we go?
So, how did you get hooked up with these guys?
Casandra. Old girlfriend?
I really thought we had something special going. I can't tell you what a disappointment you've turned out to be.
For me? What am I going to do with a piece of shit like this?
Much better.  You've been gone so long.
Who are you?
I don't care about your sword.
Yes.
Isn't it a bit too late to be out? You've brought me the sword?
Stop talking like a monk!  Just fight!
And if I use them to kill you?
My name is Li Mu Bai.  The Green Destiny is mine.  Jade Fox can't be your master.  Where did you learn that "Xuan Piu" move?
You wouldn't have understood, even if I had tried to explain.  You know... you've gone as far as you can go.  I hid my skills so as not to hurt you.
In that case, perhaps we could be of assistance.
You don't seem to understand.
Are you related to Li Mu Bai?
Put them down.
This spells trouble.
It's heavy for such a thin piece of metal!
I've read all about people like you. Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way!
No!  You couldn't roam around freely if you were.
You're doing calligraphy?
You can't die!  Tell us what poison you used!  You can't die!  Tell us the antidote!  You can't let Li Mu Bai die!
Lo?
You shouldn't have come.
Let's stop a moment.
Go.
Do you remember the legend of the young man?
Join me once you have finished.  I can wait for you in Peking.
It was Bo, Sir Te's man.  I hear he followed the thief to the Yus'.
No, not yet...
What do you mean?  Didn't you come back here for it?
Then, why did you come?
You think Jade Fox will show up?
Shu Lien... The things we touch have no permanence.  My master would say... there is nothing we can hold on to in this world.  Only by letting go can we truly possess what is real.
I'll look around and catch up later.
Save your strength.
Maybe the murderer and the thief are one and the same.
Please, Sir Te, what is it?
We must be careful.  Governor Yu is a court official, and in charge of security.  Any disturbance will cast suspicion on him.  It might get Sir Te in trouble.
This sack of shit is called Tin- Tin.
He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just muscle.
And you're gonna tell me who.
You buying?
Could be.
Well, hello there...chocolate,
You, my friend, are dead.  I saw your body.  You got buried.
Halloween is coming, soon.  You will have Top Dollar if you watch for me at the Showtime, tomorrow night.
Do you feel okay.
Well, how's your friend?
You buying?  He kinda wanders around.  You'll see him if you pay attention.
Top Dollar, you're the only one here still wasting good air...
Top Dollar.
Like the car.  He hangs out with Skank. that little ass-hair, and they hang at the Pit -- hell, Funboy lives there.  Ask Top Dollar.
Miss her?
Get it?
Your job is done.  You interfere with the living again.
You'll be alone.
Don't waste my time.
Did you see an animal of any kind? Did you see a bird?
What... the hell is that?
We've got company.
Who got himself what?
Do you think this childish machismo impresses me?  When I was a boy in Saigon I watched my country change one block at a time,  one building at a time.  Whole lives erased.  A way of life, polluted.  Today, no one forces me to move.  I use my powers to change your country, one block at a time,  one building at a time.
I'm Kathryn.
Now I remember. Annette Harrison. Your father's the new headmaster at Oakwood.
Are you okay?
Thank you.
I have his journal.
No. I mean. I don't know.  What else do you know about him?
What do you mean?
You promise not to say anything?
Look, I know this is your house and all, but do you think you couid keep it down? I'm trying to read.
The Fountainhead.
Romantic? He rapes her.
You know it amazes me that someone as bright as you can be so horrible.
Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard time.
Thank you.
I'm sorry, but you're not my type.
You're naked.
It was fine.
And that's a bad thing?
I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior.
And you promise to abide by it?
Alright.  I want you to leave and go back to New York.
No, not at all.
I'm... I'm alright.
Okay?
Somerset Maugham.
Need any company?
It's weird. I actually feel good about myself. Can we do this again next week?
What?
It's not about winning. You know what your problem is? You take yourself way too seriously.
Bonjour Monsieur Philipe.
How am I a hypocrite?
Hi.
You don't know how to love.
Ben Schwarz.
Unbelievable. Some fag, no offense -
Blaine, if I knew who it was that person wouldn't be alive right now.
What do you mean?
What are the boys like?
I'm in the bath, mom.
Who is it?
Cecile, you have to tell me.
Cecile, you had an orgasm.
I'm so proud of you. You're becoming a woman.
What year are you in?
What are you doing?
You think?
Need any company?
Don't you want to change that?
You think you can come in here with that cute little smirk on your face and try and flirt with me. It doesn't work, Sebastian.
No it doesn't. I see right through you.
My daughter, Rachel.
Whoa!
Positive.
Is she with you?
McConnell, I'm gonna out your ass in two seconds if you don't tell me where she is.
What do you do? Tell her you love her.
Lovely. How is your gold digging whore of a mother enjoying Bali? Zipping through my inheritance per usual?
Why not?
In English.  I'll fuck your brains out.
You can put it anywhere.
The plot thickens. It appears that Cecile has fallen for her music teacher.
Not to mention Court Reynolds. Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder.
I hate when things don't go my way. It makes me so horny.
Before we go through with this, I just want you to be aware of the damage we're going to cause.
That her?
Nothing.
I'm not losing the bet. It's just taking longer than I expected.
If you're heading towards her room, you won't find her.
Bad time?
No, tell me.
Some other time.
That's not fair. You're taking all the fun out of it.
Why so nervous?
To my triumph, of course.
Get off me!
I'm giving you to the count of three to plop your ass down on the bed.
I can't tell you how happy we are that Cecile is going to be attending Oakwood with you this fall. You've always been an inspiration to Beau and I on raising her. We just hope she can rise to the high standards which you've set for her.
Don't worry, it's totally understandable. Most of the boys that matriculate at Oakwood are very upstanding gentleman, however there are the occasional bad apples.
I got your message and came as quick as I could.
Not at all. What's wrong?
I can't thank you enough.
Let me get that for you.
Well please leave a message that I called.
She's not here.
She's out.
Right after we played backgammon.
Did she show up?
Do you mind if I check upstairs?
Hey Ronald.
Kathryn. Did you hit her?
Did you hit her?
I'm so glad to have met you at last. You're just as nice as Amy told me you were.  I hope you'll come to see us.
Oh, hello.
That the old actress -- Julia Farren?
It's perfectly normal for a child to dream. I can see how a sensitive little girl, finding this portrait, would take the image of this woman and make of her an imaginary friend. That image dwells only in her imagination, and that image can go as quickly as it was born.
But Edward, in this kind of a wish that doesn't matter.
Where did you get this ring?
Mommy, could Edward take me to Mrs. Farren's house to give her her present?
But it won't be Christmas tomorrow.
I know that.
Why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile?
Oilie, that's for the children to play with.
Did you hear the child out?
Ollie.
Some day I'm afraid we're going to have to tell her about Irena.
What's funny?
Oliver, please. Let's not go on with this. The child's trembling.
But I told her to go with you.
Certain wishes do.
These are all from me.
Daddy?
Irena. But who are you?
But where is that?
Will you be friend for always?
Of course. And Two is the prince who kneels before her on one knee.
You and I shall enjoy Christmas together. Shall I show you my Christmas gift to you?
You?
Look at my ring.
A ring that I can wish on like I wished on the candles?
Been crying? That won't please your Daddy. You'd bettor cheer yourself up.
You're going to be busy all day long, Edward.
But my mother says I mustn't accept gifts from strangers.
I brought you a present. Merry Christmas.
And does he kill people?
Hurry, hurry.
Look at me. Look at me, mother darling. Look into my eyes. What color eyes did Barbara have?
Promise me you won't forget tomorrow. You'll remember, won't you? You won't say that it was just a dream. Promise me.
There's another promise you must make me. That little girl who comes here...she mustn't ever come to see you again. Promise me you won't see her.
If that child comes here...if I find her trying to steal your love from me...I'll kill her. Yes, I'll kill her:
Let the child stay.
On the dark nights — on the stormy nights -- you can hear him. He passes like the wind; The flapping and fluttering of his great cloak beating like gaunt wings. The thunder of his horse's hooves is loud, loud and louder, beating hard, beating strong on the frozen ground as he comes riding, riding, riding.
Everything all right down there at the school, Mr. Reed?
Amy looks happy — seems almost as if she were playing with another child; like somebody else were running with her and playing.
You'd better hurry.  I've left Amy in the car and she's getting impatient.  She tells me there's something especially important about a sixth birthday.
A bite... Where'd you get bitten?
A dog at Victoria's Secret?
How's the rest of your health?
Sorry. It's just so bad lately. You're so lucky you never get PMS.
I think she broke the skin.
I don't see anything. Maybe just a little.
You don't think so? You either did or your didn't.
And then?
He was cute, huh? Of course whenever I meet a guy, I'm wearing no make-up.
Gross, so this is Mark's flesh? When did you see him?
What the hell is the tampon test?
You're delusional. Maybe you had a bad dream and bit your lip -- so you tasted blood. And the severed arm... well I don't see it and... maybe this is all in your head.
You say murder, but you have no idea what happened. You don't remember doing it, so it's out of your control.
You expecting someone?
You're such a good friend.
"Paranoia, insecurity, depression, changes in vision, feelings of losing control; belief that you have a mental problem..." Nothing about turning into a werewolf.
This is from a scientist in France, Madame Sconce. "The original werewolves were females. They became werewolves on the lunar cycle because it corresponded to the woman's cycle. My suspicion is that the only cure is true love."
"The female-cycle werewolf will only kill men and never kills someone she truly loves." See I knew you never loved Mark.
Fall in love.
I'm just afraid I'll hurt Peter. I think I love him.
I think George knows.
I wish I only had your problems.
No. Really, I'm... I don't feel well. I've got terrible PMS.
What?
Uh huh. So pee.
What, you got a date or somethin'?
You look different. I mean you look good.
Frida, you know you're it for me.
Hey wait, I paid three bucks for that burger. You owe me...
Frida? I hear you talking. I know you're in there. Let me in.
It's a matter of life and death.
These guys aren't the kind that'll take an apology. They're the kind that'll break my thumbs.
The Nielson's?
Coffee and...
I can't read any more crap. These women are all victims.
You wanna get some coffee?
Oh, it's nothing.
I've read scripts about detectives, but never met one. Must be wild.
A lot of people don't wear underwear.
Cool. I don't get guys who wear boxers. My ex wore boxers. I never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up.
You sure? It's my favorite shirt, mind if I check?
No, no... But Mark -- a jealous boyfriend gone mad. Maybe he kills men you date.
What's with the squirt guns?
Hello?
Yes, sort of. I mean no, not really.
Be careful!
No way can anything be proved. All they have are some wolf hairs. No one believes in werewolves.
I think I'm a werewolf.
I ate a guy last night.
Dreams about killing usually signify feelings of guilt. You had sex last night and you feel guilty.
He was saying that when women are close friends they get their periods at the same time.
Jesus Christ she got her period. Relax guys. It happens.
You kiddin'? They try to get ME drunk.
Hey, there was a lot of blood.
What?
He was found nearly ripped to shreds in Central Park.
This is more than fishy, this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead.
Nah, East Village poseur was grosser than the dude in the park.
What the fuck are you following me for? I'm not a suspect here.
What's he doing here?
Doctor!  What brings you here?
You seem a little edgy.  Everything okay?
In there.
What is this place?
Good evening, sir.
Why are you wearing that thing on your face?
That was a pretty good escape act at the station.  How did you do that?
People...  after me.
They didn't have faces.
I see.  The verdict, yes...
Someoneís after me.
What does she say?  The woman.
If you like.
We are little more than a sum of memories.  From them we reference who we are, where we're going.  Without a past we are nothing.  This is why you are so interesting.
Can I get my life back?
Why?
What are you hiding?
How do you know I'm innocent?
First Lady...
Holy cow.
First thing we're gonna work on is the mannerisms.  Alan has put together sort of a training program
I'm not certain about...
Be a professional. If you can convince her - - you can convince anybody.
You're nothing.  Do you understand me! You're NOBODY...
You're lint!  You're a flea!  You're a blip!
Oh... I'm fired?
You're fired.
Fine?
Don't call the Vice President!
I don't give a shit.
Well, start by going on television and saying that he's had a mild stroke...
Yes - - and that he ought to be up and around sometime soon.
It's a homeless shelter.
You're kidding.
He's not a President! He's an ordinary person.  I can kill an ordinary person.
I can kill a HUNDRED ordinary people.
Uh-oh...
Oh yeah... Me, too.  You want to get dinner later?
Yeah.  That's how you end up with a 400 billion dollar deficit.
Now, Dave, something has come up and I think we need to talk about it...
What happened?
Well,  let's say your mother was in the car and you had to get her to a hospital.  You'd do it then for sure wouldn't you?
What do you mean you made it all up?
No,  sir.  It's more of a perceptual issue.
Mr. President, may I speak frankly with you?
Something like what...
The Fidelity nonsense...
Yeah.
Your government needs your help.
Well, is that really true? I mean, would you really get killed just to save his life.
Didn't mean to bum you out.
I care about the homeless.
Look.  If there was some mistake...
I mean, what is it?  Another Secretary? A jaunt to the Bahamas with Some 'campaign worker.'  Where is he?
Just souvenirs.  Towels and stuff.
In fact,  I'm not anything like him and... I guess I want you to know that.
That's a secret.
Yeah.  Is that funny?
It was okay?
I know. I'm sorry...
They're crucifying you out there.
You really believe that?
Hi.
It could be fun.
Try to find someone who looks like me this time.  That last guy was a joke.
Please....shoot me.
His madness....could be from shock.
It's some kind of....elevator. There must be something under the ground here....maybe....military.
What do we do? Let'em know we're here....or what?
THIS IS A TRAVESTY! CAPTAIN RHODES IS...
Bees. That's what we call the dead... the walking dead...here on Gasparilla's island.
I can find it myself. I didn't come that far.
They seem to be havin' a good time. Some punishment.
Let me go! I'm the one he wants. This is all happening because of me. If I turn myself in...
What?
It's alright. I'm a friend. I need help and so do you. What's a safe place to talk?
Yeah. My stuff's all marked with red crosses so nobody gets too nosey. Meet me at the hospital after the supplies come in. Maybe we can find a place there to talk.
There ya go. Complete with air canisters...little motors.
It won't work. That's pure nitro you're dealin' with there. That stuff can blow if you look at is funny. What're you gonna do, walk into the Cave carryin' those tubes on feather pillows? You don't have a complete layout of the place. Even if you manage to avoid a fight you won't know where to go.
This stuff really works? No shit?
One day a dead man will refuse to return, and that man will be a saint. The first saint of our century. That's a prayer, too. A catechism. Something the priests tell us to believe.
TONY....TONY....
Come, come, Miss Science. You've seen worse.
God has damned us all. Are my atrocities worse than yours?
I want you to leave. Then maybe...
I am not...a guerilla fighter, Toby. I'm not a pioneer. I'm not...I'm not strong that way. I need...
I can work here. Maybe my work can help...help everyone. I can do more good with access to this equipment than I can off in some wasteland.
Mary.
No time for that. I'll take care of them.
Hey, Tricks. Some detail they got you on.
It will?  How do you figure?
What do you mean you don't know?
Well, of course not.  It's just that... You could have warned us.
Don't you think they'll figure out who did it?!  Don't you know they'll come to you and demand to know what the Dead Poets Society is?   Charlie, you had no right to do something like that!
I here and now commit myself to daring!
It's such a strange name!  Won't you tell us what it means?
Welcome. back, Mr. Dalton.  How's your father?
Yes sir.  We were just talking about that.
Welton Academy, hello?  Yes, he is, just a moment.  Mr. Nolan, it's for you.
I don't know about anyone else, but I could use a refresher in Latin.  Eight o'clock in my room?
Nuwanda, what is going on?
You what?!  How did you do that?
Maybe he'll have some advice.  Maybe he'll even talk to your father.
This is stupid.
It's all right, Chet.
Oh, hi.  I'm glad you made it.  Did you bring anybody?
Chris!
If Chet sees you, he'll kill you, don't you know that?
Knox, I don't believe this!
But I love you.
Look, I've got to go.  I'm gonna be late for the play.
Chet?  To a play? Are you kidding?
Uh-huh.
I have to go home. Chet might call.
Yes sir.
And don't limit poetry to the word. Poetry can be found in a work of art, music, a photograph, in the way a meal is prepared--anything with the stuff of revelation in it.  It can exist in the most everyday things but it must never, never be ordinary  By all means, write about the sky or a girl's smile but when you do, let your poetry conjure up salvation day, doomsday, any day, I don't care, as long as it enlightens us, thrills us and--if it's inspired--makes us feel a bit immortal.
Oh Captain, My Captain.  What if we don't know anything about someone like Rahesh Non?
What was going on in the courtyard the other day?
A madman.  Perhaps he was.  What kind of madman?  Don't think!  Answer.
Use your imagination!  First thing that pops to your mind, even if it's gibberish!
Well, if it's more than a whim, then you'll have to prove that to him.  You'll have to show him with your passion and commitment that it's what you really want to do.  If that doesn't work, at least by then you'll be eighteen and able to do what you want.
Give your father the benefit of the doubt.  Talk to him.  Let him see who you are.
What did your father say? Did you talk to him?
Too bad.
Damn.  Damn!  If I could just get Chris to read this poem!
Wait a minute.  I don't let my parents walk on me.
All right.  Jesus, what are you gonna do?
You know what the dead poets would say: Gather ye rosebuds while ye may...
His grades are hurting, Charlie.
You know me, always taking on too much.
I say we go tonight.  Everybody in?
Why'd you leave Balincrest?
Want to come to the study group?
What is it then?
None of what Mr. Keating has to say means shit to you, does it?
Being in the club means being stirred up by things.  You look about as stirred up as a cesspool.
Er  No.
Neil, you're not gonna...
Well, maybe they thought you'd need another one.  Maybe they thought...
Look, Todd, you're obviously under- estimating the value of this desk set.
Who are you?
They are...they are everywhere.
Hanover, listen...
Maybe we lost them.
Now look what you did!
I'm not a thief.
I was born in a City housing project in the Bronx OK? It's not in the cards that I die on a luxury cruise ship...now which way up?
Noooo!
But what makes you think there aren't more of those...things...back there?
What's that supposed to mean? You people.
I'm not rich people.
Seen a lot of islands?
Self sufficient...
I don't know where it is!
Yeah you did...
The "come back" kind.
I was so goddamn close, Finnegan! So goddamn close to my island... I could almost taste the sand...
It's not them...it's it...
There's not much horsepower left in the engines, but there's enough noise...once this baby's set...I'll rev it up...that slimy bastard will come for it like candy...
You want ME to go up there?
You don't take orders very well, do you?
Where's you friend?
Sure I do...I give a shit that at 0300 hour we reach our point of dentination. I give a shit that those mojos got to do what they got to do, and 45 minutes later we are turn around and gone. I give a shit that by the time the sun comes up we are all safely tucked in bed.
What did you do the my kids!!
Not even a Joey, I'm glad to see you? Joey, what happened to your leg?
Red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? A squid?
Can somebody tell me what the object of the exercise is here?
And what have you come up with?
Where are you going?
She fucked us both.
Fuel up. Need fuel.
That's mustard!
Here's to huntin'.
Damn right!
Who's full of shit?
They did too!
What the --!
Tell him, Vince!
Let's go!!!
You're full of shit, Vince! You're so full of shit you're going to float away!
I'm tellin' you she does it, Vince! With twenty guys you know!
In case???!!! In case of what? In case you stumble on her, suckin' cock in the front fucking hall?!
I'm glad. Seriously... I'm very glad.
Sure. Why not.
I have to go.
No. None of that.
You like to call me Linda now?
How was huntin'?
Boy, do I love this conflict. Huh?... What the hell were you doin' in there?
Merle? That's who we're looking for. Merle.
Hey, Nick...
'Course how could you miss, right? Twenty, maybe thirty feet. I mean, if I'd'a been where you guys were --
You Biederman?
That I must not tell you. Top secret. You see there. Topmost secret.
I would want to pay you, Nick... and I was thinking --
How are you?
No-o-o!
What are you doing?
Humper's ready. Old humper's hotter'n damn hell!
That way it sets.
You do?
Fucking A.
What do you think about?
Nick, he just came back.
Pow?
Hey, Nick?
I'm telling you, Nick, no one's going to come.
I thought you might be praying.
Forget Sal.
I did. I... This is stolen. I came back.
Bullshit! That's bullshit!
I'll betcha! That's bullshit and I'll betcha! You're fulla shit!
Great. That's great.
What's that noise?
Wait a minute. Sal. Hold it. John Wayne's making so much noise I can hardly --
It's Merle, Sal.
I mean, I guess you still think about Nam. Right? I mean --
Oh, Jesus!  You're kiddin'!
That's him.  Simon Doucet.
I told you.  I'm out of the cops and robbers business.  Retired twenty years ago.  I've been trained as a bus driver.  Got a whole route planned and everything.  Even nailed down the lingo - '<u>Exact change, please</u>'.
Hello Wade.
Tell Frick and Frack that means them too.
That's not your zone.  Stick to data entry.
Need help?
Does it drive itself, too?
No offense, but why'd they partner me with a rookie?
Wanna come?
Can I ask you something?
Why?
She's pretty.
Good night, Wade.
Hey, I'm eating.
You're not pregnant, are you?
Let's roll.  We got a guy who swears his car was stolen by a suspect identical to Doucet. 0800 this morning.
Rip Van Winkle.
You treat her nice.
Yeah.
You be careful.
No.  I want to be with you.
Jesus, Sanchez... what do you think you're doin'?  That's flatfoot data. You're not supposed to have access to that.
He had a partner.  Our own Ray Gallagher.  He tagged Wade dangerously defiant. Psychotic.  Reckless.  Seems our Commissioner didn't like him much. Busted his buns on a narcotic's violation.  Wade was sentenced to twenty-five years.
I'm going to be a policeman.
Hi.
I'll take it.
Jabez -- ?
That's my business. -- Now, it's all right, Daniel.  What did he do?
You think you're so smart, Mrs. Stone. You wanted to be near Jabez. It looked like your big chance tonight, but you're wrong, you can't win him back -- not that way.
And two unpara-- unparalleled Cir-cass-ian beauties? What is that?
Well, I thought he'd come in the middle.
Golly -- I'd like to see all your horses!
But it didn't stop. I know it didn't stop. Granny told me it didn't.
Well -- here's how it is ...Tom Sharp, Eli Higgins and a couple of others been talking to me about -- that new sort of organization -- grange they call it. What you think about it?
Don't I? ... Say, that's mighty white of you, Jabez.
I am just thinkin' -- now they mightn't like the idea down in Washington.
What Grange?
Jabez -- will you join our Grange now?
You know -- some folks are just lucky. Others pick gold right out of the air.  Like that!
Why do you fret about something that isn't there?
Huh? -- What's that?  Well -- what about it? Who cares, anyhow?
Where did it come from?
It's mine?
Yes, indeed. But not now. Not for seven years. Oh, I almost forgot -- what is the date?
Oh come, Neighbor Stone. I wouldn't cut that tree if I were you. It means a breach of contract.
Here's a man who knows what's good for Dan'l Webster! Medford rum! Ah, a breath of the Promised Land!  To the champion of the Iron Horseshoe, Jabez Stone!
I'm sorry you can't see that, I know you could once -- you made a little speech once, that I'll always remember and I know the others do too --  They remember and they see how you have changed. That's why they didn't want to come tonight to you, Jabez -- you're as blind as a Burma bat, with your gold pot! Mind you, it's not the money, I've been talking about, it's what you make of it.
Howdy, Squire! Howdy! Oh -- how do you do, Squire.
Well, Jabez -- I'm a little pressed for time. You wanted to discuss something -- some business --
The only one you missed -- is the President.
Now, Squire, you're not going to let me down. We still want to do a lot of business together, don't we?
I remember Dad used to say sometimes, when they were handing out hard luck, the farmers got there first.
Mary -- it's gone.
Mary, I'm a farmer -- always will be. To me seed isn't a thing to pay debts with, it's alive, more alive than anything -- but I guess you're right. We just got to do it. Oh -- how's it all going to end?
Oh Jabez! And we were counting on ...  It's a lovely calf.
You'll never change -- will you?
Mary, get three cups of camomile tea for the Squire and the rest. They all feel colds coming on.
Jabez -- once you said we'd never change --
Ruined -- all the fields -- ruined. 
Well -- I -- I-
Jabez -- Jabez!
You know that, son.
Queer sort of weather we're having -- queer like everything else.
I feel -- fidgety, Ma -- not right at all.
You see, son? I'm old and I've lived. When a man gets his money in bad ways -- when he sees the better course and takes the worse -- then the devil is in his heart -- and that fixes him.
Oh, here you are, Jabez. Lan's, I was worried about you.... Hail in August! The crops will be ruined!
Golly, Ma --  Consarn that music! Shouldn't a-had the harvest festival tonight.
Ma -- Ma -- it's all right, Ma!
It seems such an obvious candidature to us all.
Yes, you've chatted a lot, woman-like nibbling around the edge -- But, Mary, forgive an old lawyer's legal mind, I don't think you ever once came to the point. And there is a point, isn't there?
There is nothing like a good old country breakfast. Where's Ma?
Someone to see you, Dan'l!
With the presidential election coming up, I thought I could be of some help, sir.
Say, that's pretty good, young man.
There isn't enough Medford rum in the whole of New Hampshire to make me sleepy. 
And who with better right? When the first wrong was done to the first Indian, I was there. When the first slaver put out for the Congo, I stood on the deck. Am I not spoken of, still, in every church in New England? 'Tis true, the North claims me for a Southerner, and the South for a Northerner, but I am neither. To tell the truth, Mr. Webster, though I don't like to boast of it, my name is older in the country than yours.
Your Honor -- gentlemen of the jury -- this case need not detain us long. It concerns one thing alone -- the transference, barter and sale of a certain piece of property, to wit, his soul by Jabez Stone. That transference, barter or sale is attested by a deed. I offer that deed in evidence and mark it Exhibit A.
I wanted to give it all to the church.
That isn't it. It's ... the loneliness, Mr. Scratch ... the loneliness!
No, no ...  I want to talk to men ... to people in Cross Corners ...to my neighbors ...
She had a good job, it turned into a great career.
I'm Special Agent Johnson of the FBI. This is Agent Johnson...no relation.
-- ten blocks?  Are you crazy?  It's Christmas Eve, thousands of people -- the Mayor'll scream bloody murder --
Hans, he killed by brother --
Yes...I know about them.  The code key is a necessary step in accessing the vault.
The code key, please...?
Bad for your health anyway.
Then there's no reason not to tell it to us.
Three down, four to go --
I...have a request.
Well, Cappy Roberts retired out here a couple years ago.  He said I could bunk with him.
My job and my title and my salary did nothing to our marriage except change your idea of what it should be.
I hear you...  Partner.  And LA's finest are on it, so light 'em if you got 'em.
Al?  Al, you there?
The way you drove that car, I figured you for the streets.
Look...I'm getting a bad feeling up here...I'd like you to do something for me.  Look up my wife...don't ask how, you'll know by then...and tell her...tell her...I've been a jerk. When things panned out for her, I should've been behind her all the way ...We had something great going until I screwed it up...She was the best thing that ever happened to a bum like me.  She's heard me say I love you a thousand times, but she never got to hear this...honey...I'm sorry.  You get all that?
I hope so.  But that's up to the guy upstairs.  Upstairs...  ...Hans, you bastard...what were you doing?
The terrorists?  Don't know, Sir. We haven't heard a peep from them.
What about the body that fell out of the window -- ?
Is that him?
Goddamn, didn't you hear him!  He practically pulled the Goddamned trigger himself -- he gave that man to them --
Whattaya think: we gonna kill any civilians tonight, Gene?
What if we gotta kill a whole lot of people?
God damn it, Sheila isn't gonna believe it.  They just call in and say gas up a stretchout and get it down to  and I say, 'shit, another load of Elks for the massage parlors.'
Hey, Sonny!  I'm watchin' it on TV!
...because you hurt me, God how you hurt me.  Can you imagine, marrying another man?  Did I do something to make you do that?  Did I ever turn you down, or anything?  The only thing I couldn't do, you're gonna laugh, is go on top - I got this fear of high places!  And I let myself get fat.
Jesus - what - I'm afraid - I'm gonna get shot or whatever.  You oughta see it on TV, the guns, the cops, they got cannon, machine guns, they're loaded with gear.
Jenny?
What guns?
Jesus Christ is coming back and he's really pissed.
Yeah, well...maybe you better talk to one of these others, okay?
That... huh... they just shoot you with drugs.
I gotta jet coming here and we're gonna try to get the fuck outta this thing.  And we're gonna go, man!
That's it.
Huh ... I don't know.  They got Howard Johnson's there.  I don't know why the fuck I'm going there for.
Oh... wow!  Sonny, you're really into one mess now.
Would you do something for me? Please?
These guys that got me down here, you know, huh... they think that I'm part of this whole thing.  They think I'm part of the plot to rob the bank!
No!  They're standing all around me. Seven thousand fucken cops... all around me.
Somebody's got to stop him, Leon.
He needed money?  For the operation for you?
Who's this?
You frisk me.
You're all one way!  I'm bein' reasonable with you; give me somethin' ... Give me one of them, anyway ... Just one ...
He wanted to kill me!
Sonny, be reasonable!
Yeah ...
You're full of shit ...
Well, what were you doin' back there?
Don't fuck with me ...
Just one more explosion like that and you're gonna see a dead body ...
He's totally unstable.  He'll make a mistake.
Okay, is the vault open?
I must of been outta my mind.
What's the matter with you?
Where's the back door?
Now, you -- what's your name?
To what ... learn how to shoot? They don't get a gun.
Mister Mulvaney?
It's up to you ladies.
Hey, girls -- I was on television...
I didn't eat any pizza.
Ah, Sonny!  Good luck, you know?
When was the last time you saw Sal?
Did you always call him Junior.
I used to, but I stopped.
You shouldn't start now.
You're really pure, you know?  You got a perfect record.  You never used that stuff to ruin your body, why start now?
Hey, for christ's sake... now... fuckin' asshole...  He can't make it.
Ah, Jesus...
He wants one.
Okay, Sal ... what do we do?
I figure maybe we can get the FBI to make a deal ...
You realize, Sal, that we're gonna get outta the country, so if you wanna talk to somebody, do it now ... You gotta Mother or a Father? Friends?  If we gotta be outside the country, where do you wanna go?  Any country. Just name a country.
They're trying to come through the door!
Okay ... okay ... all right, Sal, it's okay.  I got everything straightened out ... it's gonna be okay.
It's the FBI.  He wants to come in.
Jesus, you'd like to kill me, too.
I ain't eaten all day.  I just realized it.
Okay, who's the head teller here?
Listen, I'll never make it.  I'll have to go to the toilet.
My kids ... Kimmy and Jimmy.
What do you want here, Ma?  You could of watched it on TV.
Mom - I got it all worked out; it's over.  The best thing is you go home.  Watch it on TV.
We can't stay here.
For God's sake don't start in on Heidi again ...
She doesn't have anything to do with it!  You understand that? Mother?  This is me!
Not now, Mom, please.
I'm a fuckup and an outcast.  There isn't one single person in my life I haven't hurt through my love. You understand that?  I'm the most dangerous person in the world, because if I love you, watch out, you're gonna get fucked, fucked over and fucked out!
Did Pop come down?
Why are you doing this?
But I mean, why do you need to steal?  Couldn't you get a job?
I'm here to talk to you, Sonny, not ...
The audience is interested in you, Sonny ... not me.
Of course not ...
<i>They can do subtitles.</i>
Anything to get the fuck out of dodge.
Yes.
Your son... and your nephew have been kidnapped by these crazy game show hosts from the Fox network. <b> INT. CIGLIUTI COMPOUND -- MASTER BEDROOM -- NEXT </b> Cigliuti sits up in bed.
<i>The FBI was breathing down Lateesha's neck... and she assumed that they were onto our scam. So she set up some college kids to take the fall for the heist. They have been under FBI surveillance for the past 6 months.</i> <b> INT. CHEVY SUBURBAN </b> Claremont drives like a maniac.
You then learned where the thieves had hidden the money... and at the instructions of your employer went to retrieve it yourself.
Are you aware that Lateesha Rodriguez has been running a counterfeit driver's license racket?
<i>You drove Lateesha's daughter to school... then dropped her off at the DMV. Why?</i>
Do you want know the real reason why I became a bounty hunter?
Cock-fuckers are gonna pay.
I refuse to turn out like them. Twenty-one years old and they're already looking for a husband.  Stupid fucking cunts with no self- esteem. They let the boys control their lives. Not me.
So who is this <i>Choko?</i> Is he your new boyfriend?
<i>Whatever.</i> He's a criminal. And this Ed Martin character is a complete loser.
What the... <i>who is this bitch?</i> <b> EXT. HAWTHORNE COMMUNITY CENTER -- PARKING LOT -- NEXT </b> Ed and Choco exit the El Camino just as Domino retrieves her knife from the windshield. She grips it in her right hand... threatening them.

Can you tell?
What did he say about the arm?
This could break new ground in terms of traditional host models. It's self-reflexive reality television.
We're covered on legal with that, right?
Just like Billy Ocean says. <i>When the going gets tough...</i>
How you be?
Ya back is got.
So?
Every single one of those pictures is somebody Italian.
I'm down, but for a worthwhile cause.
Why it gotta be about jungle music and Africa?
It's so nice to see a family hanging out together.
Make it plain.
It's been about a year.
How long?
No!
What can you say?
Squash it.
Hold your tongue.  You don't have that much love.
I didn't know you had such beautiful hair.
That was a foolish act, but it was brave.  That chile owes you his life.
Where did you sleep?
Don't you have enough sense not to bother people when they're sleeping?
Good!  Leave me alone when I'm sleeping.  I'm gonna get a lock on my door, to keep ya ass outta here.
How come you're not at Sal's?
Yeah, then ya should take better care of your responsibilities.
Hurry up and get dressed.
No.
Jade, I don't want you coming in here no mo'.
Over Sal, the way he talks and the way he looks at you.
Stop trying to play big brother. I'm a grown woman.  You gotta lotta nerve.  Mookie, you can hardly pay your rent and you're gonna tell me what to do.  Come off it.
Oh, it doesn't, huh!  You got your little 250 dollars a week plus tips...
...peanuts.
That's why I don't fool with it. Only let you touch it...Ouch!
Be gentle, child.  Mother Sister is an old woman.
You are too cruel to Da Mayor, it isn't right.
Fool, you're thirty cents away from a quarter.  How you gonna get a boat?
It's a fucking shame.
Sweet Dick Willie.
It's Miller time.  Let me go give these Koreans s'more business.
Mookie, get offa da phone.
Mookie!  How is anybody gonna call in?
Sal, can you do me a favor?
Sal, just this once, do me that solid.
Sal, just do me a favor, leave Jade alone.
Sal, if you want me to deliver any faster, get me a jet rocket or something, cuz I can't run with pizzas, all the cheese ends up on one side and shit.
Ya just got paid, so leave me the fuck alone.
I know I haven't seen you in four days.  I'm a working man.
No!  No!  You won't come back either.
That's out.  No!  It's too hot! You think I'm gonna let you get some, put on your clothes, then run outta here and never see you again in who knows when?
What else?
Tina, you're sweating.
Be a man.
Smack him back.
Pino, I think secretly that you wish you were Black.  That's what I think.  Vito, what do you say?
I didn't know you could read.
Yeah.
I don't know.
Whaddup.  Money?
You really think so?
Pop, I think we should sell this place, get outta here while we're still ahead...and alive.
Then we could try something else.
Yeah, we're closed. So go away.
CHING CHONG, What happened to your beautiful Asian accent?
I've been assigned to write an article about you for the school paper. It was either a feature on you or the new four-color ink pens at the student store.
You did?
Oh Harry, you're so funny. Now I have something that's kind of delicate...
Would you like something to drink?
LLOYD? What about Ms. Heller?
Just down the hall.
Why didn't you tell us your boyfriend was Principal Collins?
We've got some margarine too if you'd like to scoop it out of the tub.
Is it true what you said to Captain Rob?
I think it's just over there.
What?
One day they'll find a cure.
...oh also, we even have a slogan. 'S' and 'P' stands for 'Special People', which is the kind of kids we are. 'A' and 'Z' is for 'Aren't Zeros' because that is less then one, and when you put it all together it spells...
Just a guy I hang out with.
Yeah, go-cart accident.
If he heard you talking like that he'd make you walk the plank.  Three, two, one. Now it's your turn, spin.
Where did you learn that word?
That would be me, sir. The wife made stew last night.
HARRY.
No.
A. Slushee. Don't tell me.  Abraham Slushee. Third president of the United States.
These are really cold, huh?
Owww... refreshing.
...cause you said...
According to the map, we're just about at school.
Who cares? Chicks are for fags.
Do you want me to pet your head?
But-
HARRY! I found the treasure!
HARRY, would you like to share with the rest of us what's so funny?
A raft.
If you have to ask, you don't know.
Are, too.
That makes total sense. The treasure chest was in his office. Which means Principal Collins is a pirate! I'm surprised Captain Rob never mentioned him.
What was it Jessica wanted us to do with this chest again?
Ready Lloyd?
Start the tape, Lloyd.
Oh my God! She's two-timing PRINCIPAL COLLINS!
Hold up. First, we have to decide who gets who, remember? No more competition?
The one on the left.
What?
Beats me. It's Jessica's Dad - she said he's really anal.
I thought I told you to get lost.
Poor question. Too wordy. A good question gets right to the point. Example, where's my chest?
Well, what have we here? It appears be a tape.
TURK, what are you doing here?
Being a jerk doesn't make you special.
Well I was born in St. Louis.
What are you doing here?
HARRY and I have been talking about school. In fact, I want to ask you something.
So, when can we do it?
Oh, baby, you're the bestest.
No, it was a complete waste of time.
He's going to be in jail for a long time.
You really are a pirate.
What? It's nothing, the cast comes off in six weeks.
Sure.
Thanks for the grub, Mrs. D. Where's Mr. D?
What?
That's great, now make a left, then straight!
Ha! Too big to make the turn!
I think you did it.
Well you know Detective, he's expecting  'Moffit' to be someone who has... certain... well...
God, I've missed you.
You know honey, I've finally figured out a way of bilking enough money from the school to get us that condo in Waikiki.
It's the big potato.
No. No. That's not it. We don't kill him. We don't kill anybody. But I like the way you're thinking. You're focused and you're trying to follow. No, what we need to do is start a fake Special Needs class.
You said "aloha" twice.
To take a picture for Superintendent Zimmer?
So far so good. We'll need more pictures. Why don't you take them on a field trip tomorrow.
Knock knock.
Baby, I'm going to spend the morning at the mall. You know, shop for Waikiki. Honey, what are you looking for?
The evidence of what?
He will not permit anyone but me to see him. You must be outside this room.... Do what you can.
Don't you trust your own eyes.
Say it not lightly...  Do you know its meaning?
Maker?... Maker is the key word... the tooth of the worm? That was close...  Did you think that I, knowing the mysteries of the Great Mother, would not know the maker?
Run!
Cinnamon... the spice!  Do you smell it?
Man-carved steps.
Stop him yourself.
Are you a Fremen?
You have strength... real strength... You shall be known as Usul, which is the strength of the base of the pillar.  This is your secret name in our troop.  But you must choose the name of manhood which we will call you openly.
We surprised a band of smugglers.
Are you suggesting a Duke's son is an animal?
It burns.
 I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear... I will permit it to pass over me and through me. -- The Reverend Mother moves her face up to his. Her ancient face with its metal teeth gleaming inches away breathes hotly. She is smiling.
Well he isn't... and he won't die... Tell me he won't die!
I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming down the hall.
Yes. Perhaps he would at that.
Bring me two more Beefeater martinis. Eddie will have another whiskey, Dagmar's a Rum-and-coke, Moustapha and King are chablis -- hey Bela, would you like a wine?
So <u>you</u> sleep in coffins?!
I can't believe this!  <u>I</u> sleep in coffins!
Eddie, where are we?  We passed that carwash twenty minutes ago.
Excuse me, Mr. Lugosi??
No.  I don't work here.
Who are you?  What do you want?
You know, I saw you perform "Dracula."  In Poughkeepsie, in 1938.
I thought it was great.  You were much scarier in real life than you were in the movie.
I waited to get your autograph, but you never came outside.
Boy, Mr. Lugosi, you must lead such an exciting life.  When is your next picture coming out?
Vampira!  You will come under my spell!  You will be my slave of love.
Are you sure this is okay?
Ehh, your part's a little different. You're like the God that looks down on all the characters, and oversees everything.
Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster.
We can't.  Those sons-a-bitches control the rights.
Bela, what happened?!
Is there anything I can get you? Water?  A blanket?
What's in the needle?
"Greetings.  I am the Count."
"It is my home."
What is this place?
But was it a bad decision?  At the time, I thought her money would save the movie.
Eddie, this is quite a scene.
Bela, I'm on your side.  C'mon, give me the gun...  If you give me the gun, I'll make you a drink.  What are you drinking?
Eddie, I wanna make another picture. When are we gonna make another picture?
Oh.  So what is the scene about?
And, cut...
Last night was quite a romp.
I envied him.  Hell, I envied you too, having a girlfriend that would jump in front of a car like that.
I've never seen anything like him!
Um, okay... roll camera
You really think so?
You don't understand!  The octopus is supposed to live in a <u>lake</u>!
Wow.
Edward Wood, Sir.
H-how'd you know?!
Hey Cris, how'd you know we'd be living on Mars by 1970?  How'd you know it wouldn't be 1975, or even 1980?
Eddie, I don't understand.  Why are <u>you</u> the most qualified director for the Christine Jorgensen Story?
Sweetie, you won't believe it!  I've got the most incredible news!
Huh?!  Oh, uh, no, I didn't get the job. But something <u>better</u> happened!
Oh, the hell with you.  I met BELA LUGOSI!
No!  He's very alive.  Well... sort of.  He's old, and frail -- but he's still Bela Lugosi!  And he's really nice.
Ed, I'm so proud!  I'll read it as soon as I get home.
How can you just walk around like that, in front of all these people?
Ed, the landlord called again.  He wants his money.
Goddamn landlord.
That's right...
But what's our relationship?  Are we good friends, or is she just a casual acquaintance?
Oh, of course!!  There's a couple characters you'd be perfect for: The secretary at the newspaper office, or the file clerk!
Sorry to bother you while we're shooting, but the guy who owns the stage needs his money.
I kinda need it now.
Hey big shot, get off your ass.  They need a potted palm over in the Carl Laemmle Building.
He's so great, <u>you</u> hire him.
So what are you bringing me?  Looks like you got some film cans.
I don't know... this is all a lot to absorb.
Yes, but I've got the last footage he ever shot!
Mr. Reynolds!
Could we moovf to table?
Tor.  Have you ever thought about becoming an actor?
My friend, you tink Greta is first woman I ever see?  No!  Many duds, before I find her.
My eyes are killink me.
What is happening?
And they always want to cast their buddies -- it doesn't even <u>matter</u> if they're right for the part!
Mr. Welles, is it all worth it?
Yeah, well a couple of things have changed.  It ain't gonna be the Christine Jorgensen story no more. Goddamn "Variety" printed the story before I had the rights, and now that bitch is asking for the sky.
Mr. Weiss, I was thinkin' about what you said, about how all your movies have to make a profit.  And I realized, what's the one thing, that if you put in a movie, it'll be successful??
Eddie, you must have me confused with David Selznick.  I don't make major motion pictures.  I make crap.
Lugosi?
Why would Lugosi want to be in a sex-change flick?
I thought this was gonna be a sex- change film!
How long's he been here?
Oh, it's you again.
He's better.  Thank you for asking.  How's your friend?
Oh.  Okay.
Stop!
You should feel lucky.  Ed's the only guy in town who doesn't pass judgment on people.
Ed, I'm so happy for you.
Huh?!
You want me to show it on my TV program?  Well I got nothing to do with that.  You should call up the station manager at Channel Seven --
Look... would it be possible to make the "Ghoul's Wife" a little less prominent, so people won't really notice me in the movie?
Hell, I've seen a lot worse reviews. I've seen ones where they didn't even like the costumes!  Like, that last "Francis the Mule" picture -- it got <u>terrible</u> notices.  But it was a huge hit.
Wow, this lab looks great.  Except why is there a stove and refrigerator?
B-but it's our money --
Wow.
Ed Wood!  You came to my party.  I directed "Bride Of The Atom"!
I'11 have to pass, Al. And it's not an age thing --
No, I intentionally picked out a lot of crap 'cause I don't like you.
She's in the kitchen. I'd yell for her, but I'd die.  You had a busy night last night.
Whatever happened to Norman Rockwell?
Jeanette, you're hurting me.
You thought it was me?
That has my work number, my home number, my pager number. I sleep three hours a night. Call me whenever you want to talk. Off the air, on the air, whenever. Okay?
I bet my career on you. You'd better be good.
Uh-huh?
Yeah?
Ed --
Just wait here. She's coming right back out.

What?
You said that.
You know who we are?
Aah, I wanted Shari to come.
I know you. This Shari is a passing fancy.
I told you the facts! He abandoned us -- those are the facts.
He... apologized, he begged me. He can be very... charming when it suits his purpose.
She had white shoes.
What's the difference?
Oh my God. You and Al were - and that's why you threw him out.
What's going on over there?
I can't?
Are you asking me?
How much less?
Yeah...
You know, I never saw you in your uniform before.
It's really a tremendous turnoff.
So? What do they think -- we're not kids --
So...?
Twenty-nine.
What do you want me to do? You want me to quit the show?!
My truck overheated, so I opened the hood and my hair got caught in the fan belt. So I had to get a haircut.
Let's have a contest. Now this would mostly be open to professional investigators and detectives. But anyone can join in.
That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.
Yeah. I service video equipment.
You would do this? You would actually --
You're gonna be a video store clerk for the rest of your life? This is your big ambition, rearranging the "Ernest" movies?
How many opportunities are you going to get in your life?
That's right. You don't know. Doors don't fly open for guys like us.
Okay, I just wanted to get your attention. My name is Ray and my friend Bucky and I design video systems. You've got an office or a big home, we'11 come out there design you an entire system.
Who is it?
Uh, no, uh I'm a little tired. I fell asleep.
Next thing you know! Why didn't you stop?
Why me?
Look, we gotta talk.
What are we gonna fight? Ray, please, listen to me --
You know what your problem is?
And each contestant gets one of these.  An "I tried to screw a network executive" tee-shirt.
Hi, Shari.
Mr. Pekurny. I'm sorry to bother you. My son would just love to have your autograph.
No -- keep it.
Quite a shithole, isn't it?
All right... This is my father, I don't know what the hell he can do, but if anyone out there can help him -- get him a job - I'11 ... help you. I'11 ... mention your business or ... I don't know, we'11 figure it out.  I gotta go.
Look, can we all just sign the releases so we can get on with this?
You could tell Dave was one of those guys who taught because they never wanted to leave high school in the first place, and that could get a little irritating sometimes, but basically he was a real good guy.
In love?
But you haven't written your novel.
what?
Tracy, I've been watching you for going on two years now, and I think you are one of the most talented, hard-working, sensitive, attractive, brilliant students -- no, human beings -- I have ever met.  I mean, you're the real thing.  Special.
It was the first time somebody ever saw the real me, the me that nobody else knows.
You gonna do it? You gonna do it?
Don't you smartass me!  Don't you dare smartass me!  You just shut your mouth I  Now your mother and I have had a long talk with Halt Hendricks  --- we just got off the phone with him at home. You know, he doesn't want you back at Millard.  He's fed up with you.  Fed up!  And I don't blame him!
Having a problem with your eye there?
What?  Right.  So let's start counting.
Larry?
Thanks for everything.
I can't wait to start campaigning.
These are a bunch of burn-outs. And look at this one, I can't even read this one.
Tim Kobza?  Tim Kobza!  Who's he? I've never heard of him!
Yes?
Oh.  New cars.  I see.  Well, you came to the right place
Huh.  Right.  College.  Wow.  Where are you going?  Where 'd you get into?
Where to?
And this model comes with ABS and dual air bags standard.
Looks at her skeptically  doesn't say a word.
Exactly when?
So what do you think?  Should we get a room?
Shall we give it a name?
Yeah.  I'm here.
Just one more thing.  So, Mr. M., uh, do you think Tracy's going to be okay? I saw her face after the assembly, and I think she's taking it pretty hard.
253... 254... 255. I get the same as you Jim. Looks like Paul's our president.
People can see this.
Who put you up to this?
Can I sign yours too?
Have you ever heard of Dick Stensland?
Yeah I know.  Patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side.  He doesn't want any attention.
There's blood on your shirt.  Is that an integral part of your job?
Actually, it was two.  You're different, Officer White.  You're the first man in five years who didn't tell me I look like Veronica Lake inside of a minute.
I don't know.
Did you talk to Exley?
We talked.
What's going to happen to Stensland?  He'll give himself cirrhosis over this.  <u>He's one</u> <u>year from his pension</u>.
He helped me out once.  That's all.
I need you for an assignment the Chief's given me the go-ahead on. A duty few men are fit for, but you were born for.  You'll be working out of Homicide.
How what, Wendell?
You're perplexing to me these days, Wendell.  You're not your old, cruel self anymore.  I need proof that the extracurricular work I had planned for you remains within your grasp.
No.  I'll tell you sometime.  Not now.  Don't want to jinx it.  But it could take the edge off that jail time I got coming.
Don't mind the smell.  I think a rat died behind the wall... My Susie was a good girl!
Yeah, that's Stens.
What happened?
Why?
Somebody got wind of it, killed them all.
Bud...
I'm a homicide detective.  Where were you last night?
Officer White.  How about Susan Lefferts?  You know her?
Should I?
Bullshit.  Where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin?
Jack Vincennes.  He's the technical advisor on 'Badge of Honor,' sir.  He lives for it. That's the way to get him.
Anything?
Oh?  you feel that way about people, too?
Why were you throwing clothes in the building incinerator?
What do you mean Deuce Perkins got clipped last night?!
And what about the merchandise Deuce was holding for me?
Okay.  Okay.  Everyone knows Patchett's worth a boat-load of greenbacks.  From aviation, freeway construction.  But the man has hobbies, too.  He bankrolls B movies under the table and runs movie star look-alike hookers. And try this on:  he's rumored to be a periodic heroin sniffer.  All in all a powerful behind-the- scenes strange-o.
No.
I know you mean well, Dudley, but I don't need to do it the way you did.  Or my father.
Sir, I took the call.  It's my case.
Ed, I want confessions.
Don't get sidetracked.  Stay with the Nite Owl.
A vacuum, Edmund.  That's what we have in Los Angeles.  Sending Mickey Cohen up created it.  My containment work maintained it. Certain photographs guarantee it. Organized crime has been held back, but there's still a demand for the services it provides.
<u>No</u>.
Have you discussed this with anyone else, John?
You're playing an angle, college boy.  You're getting something out of this so you don't have to hobnob with the fucking rank and file cops who'll hate your guts for snitching.  If they're making you a detective, watch out.  Some Bureau guys are gonna burn in this and you're gonna have to work with friends of theirs.
Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?
Is there more to that, or do I have to guess?
We got a total of forty-five spent 12-gauge Remington shotgun shells. Three men with five-shot-capacity pumps.  All of them reloading twice.
What are you talking about?
No.
Miss Bracken, I'm Lieutenant Exley.
I'm curious about you.
Does all that make it harder for you to hate him or easier?
No.  This is the means to the reality.  But I'm not going to tell you what it is.
A police captain.  I think he's behind all of this.
Where will you go?
Absolutely not.  Dudley Smith is a highly decorated member of this city's police department and I won't smear his name without --
Okay!  You're right!  Dudley's got photos of me and Reynolds.
My daughter was a virgin!
Jack!  It's Christmas!
<u>Hush-Hush</u>.  Off the record and on the Q.T.
No.  But I've got something going with Ad Vice.
Not a word.
You're back, boychick.
How'd you like a little payback? Not to mention a donation to the widows and orphans fund.  Did you know Loew was a swish?
Jackie!  You got some good scoop for the Sidster?
He's dead.  I was just there. Somebody slit his throat.
Please hold the line... No such number is assigned.
No, Sergeant.  I checked twice.
Was it a party?
Really?  How?
I just gave him my card.
Someone else?
Me neither, but the upshot is I've got color live-action footage of you and Ms Hawkins and it doesn't look good.
I don't want any money. And believe me, I have no interest in ruining your life. I'm not interested in this tape.
Tired of chasing squirrels around the park?
Tell us about Rachel Banks.
You've heard of the National Security Agency?
Yes.
I don't know what that means.
Why don't they just identify themselves and tell me what they want?
What am I gonna do?! I mean, like, for the rest of my <u>life</u>?!
What if--
What if I find out what they're after. You know these people, I don't.
Did you call anyone?
Sorry.
The NSA's been in bed with the entire tele-communications industry since the 40's. They've infected everything: Banks, computers, phones, mail, name it.  The more technology we buy into, the easier it is keeping tabs on us. It's a brave new world.  At least it better be.
Meade has 18 underground acres of computers. They scan <u>every</u> phonecall for target words like "bomb" or "President". We red-flag phone numbers or voice prints...whatever we wanted. When the computers found something, it was bounced to comparative analysis.
Remember when Senator Hamersley died in an accident up near Shenandoah?
The NSA killed him.
Them.
Here?
In the warehouse. They're hiding in a duct on the third floor. When we go back inside, they're gonna kill us. When they notice that we're moving toward the car, they'll come running out of the building.
Empty 'em 'till they're almost flat. And turn your head. There might be some debris flying your way.
What the fuck?!
Drive.
I was thinkin' about asking for my hundred and fifty grand and calling it quits.
Well how do <u>I</u> know what they're--
What if we transmitted it over cellular?
What if <u>what</u>?
How?
You wanna get caught spying on Albert?
Baudmore Consultants.
Most of this stuff's only available to law enforcement.
Do you see anything you like?
What size?
What size?
I'll be right back.
For that matter, I think you will too.
That's my point.
You weren't at Harrison's Department Store the night before--
Anything at all?
For your wife?
I don't know what's goin' on with Zavitz, but that was way, <u>way</u> outa line.  You understand?
What?
What do you mean?
I'm sorry.
How'd you get the information on DePinto?
Who did you work with to get the--
You <u>swore</u>!
You told me you weren't seeing her at <u>all</u>.
Stacy--
No, I was with her yesterday. I want you to take Eric and go to our parents house. I want you to do it right now.
I don't think anybody wants the drapes, Stacy, I think the drapes are okay.
I opened the present you got me from Harrison's.
They're saying you killed that policeman.
It's really over?
That ain't me.
I want to talk to a goddam lawyer.
I <u>like</u> our history. And I like you. I'd probably like <u>Brill</u> if I ever got to--
Thank you.
It's really not a good idea for me to be seen with you.
I know.
You being audited?
That's temporary.
Rachel--
I don't <u>have</u> a life, Bobby. I'm in love with a married man.
You're a moron, you know that?
Gentlemen--
Well until we find, you're gonna have to take a leave of absence.
I'm sorry, Mr. Dean. But Larry's in St. Lukes now, so I'm a little--I'm not myself. The Union bosses say unless we take Bellmoth's offer, it'll only get worse.
Robert--
You're learning a cruel lesson.
Some of 'em.
Where've you been?
Are you and mom getting a divorce?
It's okay to use the phone.
No.
Why don't you give 'em a call.
I love my blender.
No, but they took my blender.
Can I talk to you a second?
He's heard that it's escalated.
Your Bellmoth case. The FBI thinks there might be mob ties.
I don't know. I mean--
No, I--
I won't <u>make</u> it to the police. They won't let me get there. You go.
Bobby? Piece of advice?
It's been a few years.
What is it you want?
Yes. But we can't.
Who?
It was in his bag. Now it's not.
No, no, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were hoping to be transferred to a weathership outside Greenland.
Yes sir.
No sir.
If he's with Lyle it means he's got resources.
We think it was on Brill. If it was, it's destroyed now.
Three minutes. We're going in light. Myself and two others. Everyone else is held back in reserve.
Federal Express?
It was pulsing on your SAT frequencies.
Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?
Daskylus…
Which stall?
This is not worth eight pounds, Mrs. Clifton.
You felt obliged to.
Be careful?  You mean you - or me? Who?
Geoffrey's not in Cairo.  He's not actually a buffoon.  And the plane wasn't a wedding present. It belongs to the British Government.  They want aerial maps of the whole North Africa. So I think he's in Ethiopia.  In case you were counting on his sudden appearance.
Don't.
When were you least happy?
Okay.  And what do you love? Say everything.
What do you hate most?
Say you're feeling faint - the sun.
Arabic?
I don't care to bargain.  It's full of saffron, just in case you think I'm giving it to you to encourage your sewing.
Of course.  You didn't need to slap my face to make me feel as if you'd slapped my face.
I just know - any minute he'll find out, we'll barge into somebody we'll - and it will ill him.
What?  What?  That boy, that little boy, you were holding his collar, gripping his collar, what for?
Please don't move me.  It hurts too much.
Tell me about your garden.
Clifton - your wife - do you think it's appropriate to leave her?
I think the desert is, it's - for a woman - it's very tough, I wonder if it's not too much for her.
All the same, I, were I you I would be concerned -
It's Geoffrey under this.
Right.  And what's your name, sir?
And where are the Expedition Maps?
Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government.  They're confidential. They shouldn't be left lying around for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have sight of.
Why do they care about our maps?
Look, either shut up, or go home.
Had a letter from my wife.  The wisteria is still out, which I'm looking forward to.  She says Dorset is gripped with Invasion Fever.  Wrong coast I should have thought, still…
Bermann thinks he'll be interned, poor fellow.  I'm going to do what I can, but…  And D'Ag turns out to be a great admirer of Mussolini. So now you can say I told you so.
Yes, I've been asking for weeks, a month, I don't know, also my leg was -
Well, you must know.  You were brought up Libya, yes?
What do you want?
Yeah, for a while.
I'd like to stay.  That's the long and short of it.  I mean, you know blah-blah if it's convenient, if there's room blah-blah-blah.  I have to do some work here -I speak the language. There are Partisans to be -  -we embrace them and see if we can relieve them of their weapons, you know - while we hug.  I was a thief, so they think I'd be good at that.
I'm okay.  Look, it's a big house. We needn't disturb each other.  I can shoot a pistol!  I'll sleep in the stables.  I don't care where I sleep.  I don't sleep.
What do you do?  What are you doing here?
Who are his ghosts?
I think that's called looting.
Have a drink.
So, I come across the Hospital Convoy  I was looking for this stuff, and some nurse, Mary, Hana's friend, tells me about you and Hana, hiding in a monastery, in purdah, whatever it is - retreat -  how you'd come in from the Desert and you were burned and you didn't know your name but you knew the words to every song there was and you had one possession -  - a copy of Herodotus - and it was full of letters and cuttings, and then I knew it must be you.
I'd seen you writing in that book. At the Embassy in Cairo, when I had thumbs and you had a face. And a name.
I was just saying, I'm going to cable Downing Street, see if I can't stir up a few shillings - Katharine's mother and the PM's wife are best -
Right.
Sweltering.  Come on, I'll take you home.
Sweetheart, you know we can't go home, there might be a war.
Of course.  Well, we should all go out onto the terrace.
And a special thank you to Geoffrey and Katharine, without whose fund raising heroics we should still be kicking our heels. They toast the Cliftons.
Candaules…you're laughing at me.
Are you asleep?
He's Canadian.
Excuse me -
Can I ask - my friend, can he come in? Just for a few minutes?
This is Captain McGann.
Something smells so rich.  My stomach is heaving -
Could I ask you to move?  I'm sorry - but when you turn, the sheets, I can't really bear the sheets moving over me. Sorry.
I'll probably marry him.
I liked it better when there were just the two of us.
Excuse me.  Yes?  I don't have the key to that door.
What do I do?
What is this business with you and explosives?  Do you think you're immune?
You must get away.  Before I cut. I'm not cutting if you're here. He's struggling.  He's going to topple over if he cuts.
If one night I didn't come to the tent, what would you do?
But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?
And what if he really is a spy?
Why Picton?
I've got a surprise.  A boat!  We can go to Capri.  It's got a cabin, it's private.
You've got a mustache.
Yessir.
How romantic.  With Fiona I fell over every five minutes.  Ronnie Christened me Lady Downfall.
What I really object to, Uncle, is your finishing all my condensed milk.  And the message everywhere in your book - however slowly I read it - that the best destiny for India is to be ruled by the British.
This is wonderful!
You tell me.  I remember a lot of things. I remember a garden, plunging down to the sea - the Devil's Chimney we called it - and there was a cottage at the bottom, right on the shore, nothing between you and France.
A thief this good could handle the sensors in the rooms. What we don't get is how he effectuated his entry.
The windows don't open.
That's great if you're a computer. In the real world that pane weighs 200 pounds. The building's 600 feet high.
You ordering chop suey again?
Meaning--
You're saying the thief wants us to think it's Mac but it's really not.
Don't overestimate yourself.
Believe me, if you weren't so tiresome, I'd have one for you.
I know.
I'm telling you it's a forgery. The paint's still wet for God's sake.
A film case.
I don't believe this.
So the Duke dug a tunnel--just in case. They made the lake a hundred years later. Flooded the tunnel.
I wondered who'd been giving me a bad name.
The Rembrandt--that was quite good.
On what? Another job?
So you're testing <u>me</u> now?
Got it.
You bought this for me?
Aren't we early?
Popup, on floorboards. And--
Don't turn. I'm counting the steps to the entrance.
Ready?
We did it.
Okay, you're a thief.
The big job.
Your share.
No, really, it's your plan, you should get at least 30 per cent--
Hmmm...44 long.
Idle hands, the devil's workshop.
Oh my god, I thought--
The eight billion. From them to us.
Nope. The CD instructs the computer to replace those instructions with an innocuous loan coded XJ-6.
So how long till we do this?
You can't be serious.
There's always a surprise.
Pulse detectors.
Parachute.
You shouldn't have.
Jesus.
Hang on.
What's wrong.
It's only ninety seconds up the line. You're on a connection to a trans Siberian express.
They've been on to you all along. Knew you had a big job going.
They work off the O2 tank just like the slice pack.
The porta power...comm kits...got the IR/Thermo camera?
I need you to get one more thing for me. A dress, elegant but sexy, something Grace Kelly would wear. Maybe a Balenciaga.
You two make quite a couple.
You'll just have to have faith.
Take this mask. It may look like the Empress, but it's not.
The face decays, the mask doesn't. Art lasts, we don't. That's why art's so valuable. It's a little piece of immortality.
My friend, you always surprise me.
Anna?  With this real-estate valuing stuff - - could you remind me, cause I'm a little confused about how exactly we do that.
Um, Erin?  Listen.  Even though you're not necessarily my favorite person in the world ...  ... sometimes you're not half-bad.
Tell you what, why don't you go on over to reception, tell them I said Mario should take you to the airport.
His dry cleaners.  You want him?
Whoa.  Remind me.
You shouldn't judge, Brenda.
How does someone get meningitis?
I'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry & Vititoe?
Cause first you gotta move, then there's decorating, and if the windows aren't the same size, you know -- you're making all new curtains.  Honest to God, I don't know if I have the energy.  You know, I've been sick. Me and Peter both have.
So the whole idea of selling the house -- don't get me wrong, I'd be glad to move to some better place, but if they aren't gonna pay us properly, I just don't see the point.
You bet.  Paid for a check-up for the whole family.  And not like with insurance where you pay, then wait a year to be reimbursed, either.  They just took care of it.  Just like that.  We never even saw a bill.
Cause of the chromium.
Seems like an awful big coincidence -- your water being messed with and you being so sick.
Well -- then it's gotta be a different than what's in our water, cause ours is okay. The guys from PG&E told me.  They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine.
No.  Hunh-uh, see, that's not what the doctor said.  He said one's got absolutely nothing to do with the other.
It's a good day.  I feel good.
Five million dollars?
I don't even know how much money that is.
I can put them in a good school.
... Matthew's six, Katie's four, and Beth's just nine months.
Oh, please, it was long over by then.  God damn, he made me look like some cheap --
You never called me back.  I left messages.
I'm sorry about that.  Really.  But --
Okay, enough --  Now, look, Erin -- this incident aside, I don't think this is the right place for you. So what I'm gonna do is make a few calls on your behalf.  Find you something else, okay?
Oh, yeah?
I'm the one who's injured, and this joker who sits at a desk all day is gonna walk away with almost half my reward?
Okay, so here's what I'll do.  I'll go on up to Ted and Rita Daniels -- two of the nicest people you'd ever hope to meet, who spend every single day watching their little girl fight like a dog against this cancer -- I'll tell them we can't help them cause you don't feel like working that hard.
You think there's more?
They covered 'em over.  And not too carefully either, cause you dig one inch under the surface, and the dirt is green as a fucking shamrock.
Erin -- lemme tell you something.  If I'da put three researchers on this, I wouldn't expect them to dig up all the information you got here.  This is some damn good work.
I like this case.
Me too.  That's why I like it.  It's been a long time since I had a case I cared about.
Hey.  I like working with you.
He said he'd be at the gas station at six.
Holy shit.  Who do they represent, God?
If you tell me to relax, I'm gonna kick your fucking head off --
Look, this is serious now.  They're talking serious money --
You're emotional.  You're erratic.  You say any God damn thing that comes into your head.  And I'm not saying that's bad.  That can be great; that can be a lot of fun --
How dare you take that away from me.
So why would PG&E offer it?
Okay, good.  I think I should be the one to tell 'em, cause they trust me more than --
The fuck I'm not.  I don't care what the doctor says --
But I know you're not gonna quit on me.
Two million dollars?
Well, it's pretty boring work, shredding -- you gotta find some way to entertain your mind.  So yeah, I took a look.
You come to the right place.
So that stuff -- it kills people.
Yeah.  A real moron.
Masry & Vititoe, can I help you?
Hey, Erin, I thought you were taking a sick day.
PG& -- Are you sure?
Hey, Ros.  Nice view, huh?
Hey -- those are my files --
I said, <u>whose number do you need</u>?
Just introducing myself to the neighbors.
Great.  Another deadbeat.
This isn't gonna get you laid, you know.
You're not nothing, Erin.
Well, hell, I guess that's it, then, huh? They're scarred for life.  They're gonna start holding up 7-11's any day now.
What?  Beth?  My Beth?
And I miss you.
It's just -- the pain.  It's only getting worse.  I can't be a good wife.  I can't be a good mother.
Wow, that's soon --
Dr. Paulsen?
Hi, I'm Erin Brockovich.  I was just over in the library there, asking a mess of questions about -- I guess they call it epidemiology? -- and the fella there told me to find you, cause you know all about it.
... and when I realized our area's just as bad as Hinkley, I thought maybe my neighbors are all sick too.  So I went and asked.
It was .... the Emperor ....
Yes, he commands you make contact with him ....
Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing.  The Millennium Falcon definitely went into lightspeed. It's probably on the other side of the galaxy by now.
You must survive, Luke.
... Luke, you must not go.
Will you?  You underestimate The Emperor.  It is you he wants ... that is why your friends suffer.
Luke, I will not lose you to the Emperor, as I lost Vader.
Turns on Lando, the newcomer, with an ominous growl.
Barks a doleful farewell.
Barks at his master.
I'm looking for a great warrior.
Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land here, and if I could get my fighter out of this puddle I would, but I can't.  So ...
Mine, mine.
Because of my father, I guess.
Yes sir!
But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally.
With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.
You, too, golden rod.
You must have gone completely out of your feeble mind.
Asteroids!  Chewie, bank left, let's find out where they're coming from ...
But we're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer.
We've got to get out of this shower.
They're moving away.
There's nothing dull about a man I can depend on to be civilized.
I see it Chewie, hang on.
What'd you have in mind for your next move?
Well, sometimes ... Ah-hah, I knew it!  Lando Calrissian.
Lando's not a system, he's a man. A gambler, con-artist ... all- around scoundrel ...  ... your kind of guy.  The system is called Bespin.  It's a ways from here, but reachable.
You do have your moments ... Not many, but you do have them.
You look silly.
I hope Luke made it to the fleet all right.
About what?
This ought to be good.
What about Leia and the Wookiee?
That was never mentioned.  Neither was this bounty hunter taking Han. I hope you haven't forgotten our bargain.
That wasn't the bargain.  You said the Empire wouldn't interfere in--
Sorry, am I interrupting anything?
It's a lovely outpost.
What'd you say?
I knew that set-up was too good to last .... I'm going to miss it.
The speeders should be ready in the morning.  They'll make the search easier.
You rest now.
Artoo, you did it!  I never doubted you for a second ...
Leia ... What would you think if I went away for a while?
Leia!
Lando, is he alright? ... Lando? Are you there?  How's Luke?
It would be in seven pieces, were you a Jedi.
Master, moving rocks is one thing, but this is a little different.
I can't. It's too big.
No, no.  This will not do.  Anger is what you feel.
But tell me why ...
My mind fills with so many images.
And sacrifice Han and Leia?
Your future lies with us, Skywalker. Now you will embrace the dark side. Obi-wan knew this to be true.
All too easy.  Perhaps you are not as strong as The Emperor thought.
There is no escape.  You must join me or die.  Don't make me destroy you here ... The Emperor is strong with The Force.  But if you join me, together we could overthrow Him.  Do not resist. It is our destiny!
The Hoth System?
Seventeen ships destroyed, we don't know how many got away.
It won't get through the blockade.
Nobody's going to believe it.
Zira, are you mad?
You were injected with glucose. There is no Plutoxin 7 virus. You were never going to die - at least not from anything we gave you.
Ooww!
Where is he?
Give it.
You're about to get hit, Cuervo. It's Plissken.
I thought he was, but he came back.
I wouldn't be doin' that, Snake.
Wait a minute. All right. Hold on.
Why should we leave? I love L.A. Where we gonna go? What's the payoff?
So what's the deal, gorgeous?
See you in hell, Snake.
She's overloaded! We're too heavy.
I think we've burned off enough fuel. We may be lighter enough to hover. Just barely.
No. The right skid's broken. If I try to set it down she'll crash. I have to stay in a hoverwhile you jump off.  Hey, Carjack. We gotta hide the girl. Give her your dress.
That's the deal.
Maybe. But you're not putting any shit in me this time.
So you want me to take her out?  Is that an order from the President?
Not you?
Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens.
You're a star in your own right, you know that? Hey, I'm Map To The Stars Eddie. How you doin'?
Where are they?
Location.
Aw, come on, Snake.
Is that what I think it is?
Say, you need anything, Snake? Guns? Explosives? I can get you a crate of hellfire grenades, no problem - five hours.
No screamin' shit.
Don't follow me.
Why don't you get out of L.A.? Take a boat to China, take an airplane to Brazil?  Earthquakes, death, shit. Why do you stay?
The freeway.
What are you gonna do in Venice?
Is he coming?
My King, I couldn't do it. Excalibur cannot be lost. Other men--
Sir, your rage has unbalanced you. It seems you would fight to the death against a knight who is not your enemy, for a length of road you can ride around.
Lancelot, how did you fare in the North?
Your deeds set an example for all other knights. For your gift, ask a gift of me.
Yes. He spoke to me. He said I would fight bravely tomorrow. I have never dreamed of Merlin before.
How? Where?
What book is that?
Guenevere...
At your service, sir.
I am alone and betrayed. By my wife, by my beloved friend, by my knights. And by you. Perhaps most of all by you. For you made me, you forged this wretched life. And like a child tired of a toy, you toss me aside, a babbling lecher trotting after my sister...
Quiet. You'll wake the men, and they must fight tomorrow for their very lives.
Father...
I left it in the tent, sir.
Who is, then?
It didn't hurt too much, did it?
Sir Gahalt, answer the Queen.
I am wasting away and I cannot die. And I cannot live.
And there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you?
There are things about love--
Just a man. A knight in the King's service.
Very well. Climb up.
Listen, boy, it's more than twenty days from here.
I have found you. The Queen. An apple. Tomorrow. Sir Gawain...
It is.
You know what I want. I want the secret of true magic, how to thicken the stuff of dreams and wishes with the flesh of the world.
You are truly magnificent!
I am the cloudburst that quenches the flames.
It's done. A truce. We meet at the river.
The oath. You didn't say--
It's not for you, Uther, hearth and home, wife and child.
Burke take a look at this damn thing it just doesn't make sense.
C'mon I can read for Christ sake.
That's right Mike. But he's finished and came back around three ot four months ago, He's in Woodstock now.
No, he's working on another book.
You're convinced that it's genuine.
You'd want to do the exorcism yourself?
Oh circuit my ass, he doesn't give a shit!
What the hell do you mean going out and leaving Regan by her self! What are you kidding her window's wide open...
Didn't who tell me?
Oh, I see.
I know that. I realize. But if a certain British doctor never asked "What's this fungus?" we wouldn't today have penicillin. Correct?
I lied. It's for me. The spelling is on the back, Kinderman. You know that film you made called Angel? Isaw that six times.
Karl? Did you put this in Regan's bedroom?
A disorder of the nerves. At least we think it is. We don't know yet exactly how it works, but it's often seen in earl adolescence. She shows all the symptoms: the hyperactivity; the temper; her performance in math.
Do you keep any drugs in your house?
So, how'd a shrink ever get to be a priest?
You're a friend of Father Dyer, right?
And how do you go about getting an exorcism?
That's all the more reason to forget about exorcism.
To begin with it could make things worse.
Well before the church approves an exorcism, it conducts an investigation to see if it's warranted. That takes time. In the meantime...
Thanks. Look, I'm only against the possibility of doing your daughter more harm than good.
Did Regan know a priest was coming over?
No, is Regan aware of it?
She...killed Burke Dennings.
Oh mom, you should have seen this man came along on this beautiful grey horse.  Wasn't it pretty?
You've been playing with it?
It's not even a good picture. Looks to mature.
What are we gonna do on your birthday, isn't that nice it's on a Sunday this year, what can we do?
I love you Rags. We'll have a good day yeah?
Where'd you ever get an idea like that?
Oh you did. What did you hear?
People get tired.
Over behind the church, you know where I mean over there, it's a red brick wing?
She doesn't remeber a thing.
Pathological states can induce abnormal strength, accelerated motor performance. For example, a ninety-pound women sees her child pinned under the wheel of a truck, runs out and lifts the wheels half a foot up off the ground. You know the story, same thing here. Same principle, I mean.
Oh Christ! I should of been there and I wasn't there, I should've been there.
Think you can sleep?
She seemed fine.
Hello Regan. I'm a friend of your mother, I'd like to help you.
I see. Well then let's introduce ourselves, I'm Damien Karras.
Where's Regan?
Your mother's in here with us Karras, would you like to leave a message? I'll see that she gets it.
He broke the bread, gave it to his disciples and said "Take this, all of you and eat. For this is my body." When the supper had ended, he took the cup, again he gave you thanks and praise. Gave the cup to his disciples and said "Take this, all of you will drink from it, this is the cup of blood, the blood of the new and ever lasting covenant and the mystery of faith".
Did you do that?
I am no one! I am no one! He is a priest!
I'm all right.
Is that too tight?
You are not happy. Tell me what is the matter?
No.
Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day, our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation.
Save me o' God by thy name, by thy might defend my cause, proud men have risen up against me, men of violence seek my life, but God is my helper, the Lord sustains my life and every need he has delivered to me, glory be to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.
Let the enemy have no power over her.
...and to redeem through your son. Who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the holy spirit, God forever and ever.
...and the power to confront this cruel demon.
Shut up!!
Can you give her something?
Really?
Not to bother you with trivia, but a psychiatrist in sunny California was thrown in jail for not telling the judge what he knew about a patient.
Yeah, I hate to go alone. You know, I like to talk film; discuss the critique. D'you wanna see a film with me? I got passes to The Crest. It's Othello.
...in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ!!! It is he who commands you! He who flung you from the heights of Heaven to the depths of hell!
We want to see Mrs. Karras.
Is there someone inside you?
Give me the keys.
Now?  Why not tomorrow?  After the show.
Twelve years.
So?
Trunks?
Just the same.
They gotta go.
I think maybe I'll bring him back next week ...
You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?
Well, if it isn't the fabulous Baker Boys!
Uh, Ma, you know, no one calls him that anymore. Jack. He goes by Jack.
Oh no!
What happened to the two Clays, Willie?
What's the gig?
You know, my brother and I have been playing together, gosh, I don't know.  How long has it been, Jack?
I mean it, Jack.  Behave.
What d'ya got?,
You know, I think it's been five years since I saw you eat anything. That's the God's truth.
I'm not seeing anyone.  In particular.
By the way, we gotta go see Ma tomorrow.
I've had enough family for one month, Frank.
So talk to me tomorrow.  After the gig.
What're you talking about?
Frank.  Fuck it.  Okay?
What's that?
Thirty-seven girls. And not one who can carry a tune. That must be statistically impossible.
Jack.
Where the hell is she?
No.
Something, huh?  All those bids.
I thought we all had separate rooms.
Frank asked if she'd sit in for a song, she said yes, and we did a few bars.
But if it doesn't work out, let me know.  I'm,flexible.
You leaving that on?
So you're gonna leave it on. Every night.  For a week.
Jack ... Jack ... You're acting like a kid.
What matters to me is we've got the six easiest nights we've had in ten years. So 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon' sounds a little flat. So what?  Nobody's gonna hear it, Jack.  Nobody. So why should you care?
What?
What's the matter with you?
Just wonder what she's up to. I never see her.  Makes me nervous.
Funny, huh?
You saw wrong.
A useless talent.
I always think of him on New Year's. How he used to pour us each half a can of beer. Remember?
Seventy-one?  What's seventy-one?
What-are you?  A fucking moron? It's three o'clock in the morning, Frank.  Who's watching?  Your wife? Maybe you can get us a gig playing Little Frank's birthday party. What do you think?
Fuck you.
Looks like these got a few years on them.
You should've told us you were coming, Ma. We would've come and got you.
I guess you're,right.  Well, what do you say we get a little midnight snack? Theo's should still be open.
Your limo's ready, Ma.
Hey, it's legit.  Strictly dinner and dance.
I sing now?
When?
What I mean is --
Come on.  We don't have much time.
A seven.
Hey, pal.  I don't know about you, but where I come from there's a little girl's room and a little boy's room and the little boys don't go where the little girls go.
What do you think?
Well, they're aspiring to be sevens.
Right.
The switch.  Hit the switch.
Jack, you with us?
I guess it's,the Plaza then. That brings us to the twenty-seventh. We got the Avedon for three or the Park downtown for two.
Virgins?
Go ahead.
And how about this air? I'm telling you, a few days in this place'll put five years on your life.
Hey, will you look at that?
What do you say we send a bottle over?
Good morning, gentlemen.  I'm Mr. Daniels, the manager.  I believe I've spoken to one of you on the phone.
Lucky for you.  Well, there you go, guys. Don't spend it all in one place. Oh ... you want to count it, Jack?
No.
No, I, uh, left a dog here this morning. He needed some work on his mouth.
And you don't?
You never sang before?
The Park?  It's only two nights. Why throw away a night?
Where's egghead?
He takes after our mother.
Uh-uh.  I never touch American cigarettes.  What's tomorrow again?
Nice place.  Fulla velvet.  Even the bedspreads.  Damn!  Two-fifty a pack and I go through 'em like toothpicks. Twelve-and-a-half cents a piece, you believe that?
You kidding?  We must've killed three pots in there.  Anyway, I gotta get home.  Rest the pipes.
Forget it.
He do that every year?
So why's he do it?
I can keep the beat.
All I said was you were good.
What's that supposed to mean?
You were good.
Nina?
Friend.
Like diamonds, huh?  I never get over it. When I was a little girl, my mama'd stand me before the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a wish.Like I could reach out and grab all the lights of the city and string them into-a necklace for myself.  She'd take my hand and when she closed her eyes, I don't know, it was like she really believed it.
You know, I saw you guys once. You and Frank.  At the Roosevelt.
History.
Oh. So what's it doing here?
Ma didn't want it around.  After.
Shit.  I think I started a fire.
Saw the sign outside.  Got your own sign, huh?
Ah, you know. Howsa pooch?
Yeah.  The big boys sent it down yesterday.
In the old days, every man had a shaving mug that he kept at the barber shop.  Then, whenever he wanted a shave, held go down to the barber shop and there would be his mug, waiting for him.
Older than me.
How's that dog of yours?  What was his name?
I'm complimenting you. Can't you ever just say "thanks"?
Try to kiss my butt just once before I'm transferred.
He's lying.
Where am I?
Pollux ...
What do you mean?
Do you know what it is to be in a coma?  It fucks up everything -- including your memory! I can't even tell you why Dobbs jumped me yesterday!
That's not the worst part.
... I was dreaming ...
No.
You said you'd be here! You promised me -- you promised Jamie!  What could be more important than that?
I took it from my fake husband.
Which ear was it?
You haven't got a chance in hell of fooling Pollux. Castor drinks, smokes and walks around with a 24-hour hard-on.  He's nothing like you.
You missed the last three, including her birthday.  Your wife's gripe sheet.
One of my informants spotted him -- right here in the city.
I'm not hiding in my work, if that's what you're saying.
What's it to you?  I declare it.  Here I am, back in the States for less than a month --
What are you going to do, Castor?
What are you going to do!
Give up, Castor.  People are going to find out.
They're too tight.
You better be nice, Castor. You could get mighty lonely now that Pollux is gone.
Archer cut him a deal for turning state's evidence. He's free.
SFPD?  Castor isn't stupid enough to come back to the city.
There's my little darling.  The night wouldn't be complete without you.
Oh -- Commander.  I didn't see you ...
Castor's escaped!
You're both in custody until there's a DNA fingerprinting and we can prove who's who. Now put the gun down.
I can't even look at you without wanting to vomit.
All of them do.  We'll kill twelve birds with one bomb.  And we'll be rich.
What's that?
You'd have to start immediately.
I just thought that -- under the circumstances -- you might want to postpone the meeting with the station chiefs.
What happened to your big "assignment"?
Jon -- I don't have time to play games.  There're leftovers in the fridge.
... That's great.
I'm late.  Gotta protect and serve the world, y'know.
-- Yes.
Where's Jamie?
Kate Reynolds...
God, no.  I thought about it for practically the entire flight...
Mr. Mintz.
You have kids, Jack?
I was a sales associate, at E.F. Hutton.
Well, Alan, I think we’re gonna have a banner year. Sales are up almost twenty percent in the first quarter and we just landed a major trucking company account.
Take you, for instance...
...that’s our war room. We did seven major deals last year, three of them hostile.
Mom, don’t you think we need to open the presents?
You know how to make chocolate milk?
You promise not to kidnap me and my brother and implant stuff in our brains?
This is day care.  It’s where babies go when their parents are at work.
Not bad...I shoulda warned you.  Dad always does something really special for their anniversary.
One year he had a solar system named after her...
Very nice. What is it?
What are you doing?
Trouble at work?
You see, it’s like we’re in each other’s heads...
Look, maybe I’m not as good a consigliere as you are but you have to trust me on this one.  A little flirtation’s harmless but you’re playing with fire here.  The Fidelity Bank and Trust is a tough creditor.  You make a deposit somewhere else, they close your account forever.
C’mon, Evelyn Thompson’s got no class.  She doesn’t marry Dr. Steve, the woman’s living in a trailer.
Hey, you can’t park that thing here.
Like I said, it's a business deal...
Okay, Jack.  Nice doing business with you... Cash is about to take off...
Miss me, Jack?
Might wanna fasten your seat belt, Jack...
Everyone else in that store is a statue, they see their lives passing in front of their eyes, but not you.  You’re making a business deal...
Look, eventually, everybody gets one...some of ‘em take a couple seconds...  ...some of ‘em take a lot longer...
Figure it out.  You got plenty of time.
As long as it takes to figure it out.  Which, in your case, could be considerable.
Do I look like I need your money.  It doesn’t work like that and I can’t tell you why.
You can’t do this. You can’t keep coming in and out of people’s lives, messing things up...
I’ve got kids, I’m going home...
...06...14...18...48...right there.  Four numbers...that's two hundred and thirty eight dollar...  Merry Christmas and shit...
I'm thinking I might walk tonight, Frank.
Merry Christmas to you, sir...
Right, for us. But...I’m afraid that if you get on that plane...
Where were you?
Yes, I’m fine.  It’s just this god awful football phone!  Who has a phone like this anyway?!
Jack...
Uh...that baby’s crying...
Shouldn’t we grab some dinner first?  Maybe a bottle of wine...?
Thanks, Jack...
I think it worked out okay, don’t you?
You want the cake!?
Say it, Jack...
Maybe I should wait...
Now I’m worried...just say it.  Whatever it is we’ll deal with it.
I never used to be like this, Kate.  I had it all figured out.  No doubts, no regrets.
C’mon, Jack, you think there aren’t mornings when I wake up and wonder what the hell I’m doing in New Jersey...
I mean yes, I help people that need it...
I can’t believe you want to move back into the city.  I thought the reason we left was because we didn’t want to raise the kids here?
I promise, Jack...
What’s going on?
Don’t get on that plane!
No...
Someone's gonna have to nurse him through this.
I need you, tiger..
Peter Lassiter...
It's Christmas Eve, Jack.
That’s totally see through...
Do you want me to look for the box or call the airline?
I’ll go for a cup of coffee!
You don't know what it's like out there.  Walking around like some kind of circus freak.  People staring, whispering --
Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here?  This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science --
Maybe you should think about <u>yourself</u> for once.  You always let this guy push you round --
This is your dream, Reed.  You should be the one up there.
I don't know.  I just keep going over and over the numbers.
Are you alright?
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God?  Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp.  Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
The machine works.  And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
Oh my G-g-g.  What did you...do to Ben?
What are <u>you</u> doing here?
Way to not overthink it.  So when do we leave?
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
He didn't.
He didn't mean it.  You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
<u>Where is Reed</u>?
Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you --
He's right.  These costumes are... missing something.  I can't put my finger on it --
That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber.  It's muscle, tendon.  I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to --
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --
What is that <i>thing</i>?
Sweet.
If Reed's right, then this little trip will double our stock offering.
Leonard, how's the feed?
Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal...  I've <u>got to</u> do something about this scar.  Make sure they only shoot my right side.
Sir, I've always wondered... Why <u>Sue</u>? You could have any woman in the world but --
Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here.  And keep it quiet.  I don't need this to hit the press.
We've got <u>minutes</u> until it hits, not hours...Victor, that storm's <u>deadly</u> -- the radiation's lethal.  We need to abort.
Ben's still out there --
Not until Ben is back inside!
<u>Abort</u>?  Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will <u>not</u> let you make me look like a fool --
What are you doing here?
Well, uh, based on our history...you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics.  Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--
That's good.  That's uh...good.
Which was?
Uh, Sue...?  I <u>can't</u>.
It's not "invisibility" per se. You're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field.  That's what you projected on the Bridge.
It's just business.
What are you doing?
Please don't make this personal --
Grant's uniquely qualified for this mission. He's a Communications Expert and was a Frogman during the War. Besides, he brought Benes into this country, and the fewer people who know about him, the better. At any rate, you'll find Grant invaluable, should anything go wrong once you're under way.  Okay, Don.
They've crossed over into the Jugular Vein!
We still have fifty-one minutes. Leave them in.
Now how soon can we try Sodium Pentathol?
Cora Peterson, his Technical Assistant. You'll join Duval and the others --
But why take the chance, when there must be other doctors?
I assume Benes knows how to control it.
They're bound to try again. No wonder they want me to stand by during the operation.
I can't imagine how it possibly could have come loose. I distinctly recall fastening it with all four bolts --
What is it?  Anything wrong?
He's making a fine recovery.
I understand you've been Dr. Duval's Assistant for quite some time... He must've snatched you out of the cradle.
Oh, no. Plenty of cause. He won't follow the herd, or change his convictions -- even when they're not popular. And he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries -- and these days, there's nothing more suspicious than that.
What do you mean?
Looks like the molecular structure of proteins.
Mind letting me in on what's going on out there?
How does it look, Doctor?
Miss Peterson, his Technical Assistant.
That's just dandy. We can't go forward -- and we can't go back.
Tell them to take us out.
All right now -- push the snorkel through as soon as I get inside.
But that'll knock out our communications! We'll be cutting ourselves off from the outside.
You have no right to blame Duval --
I can't believe it. Whatever happened was an accident.
I can't tell you.
If it's no military secret, how can a sub run on a microscopic particle?
Any reserve air?
Come on -- it's no use!
We feel great, don't we? Just <great>?!
It's a dangerous procedure. If I miss the timing, we could explode the tanks... But I'm willing to try it.
We could never fight that current it's physically impossible.
The Wall's transparent...
I am through fucking around! Drop that fucking briefcase!
Have ya been to the Celebrity Room before? With other, uh, clients?
...Look at that. Twin Cities.  IDS Building, the big glass one.  Tallest skyscraper in the Midwest.  After the Sears, uh, Chicago...  You never been to Minneapolis?
Huh?
Well, okay, it's -
Okay.
Well, it's all just part of this - they don't know I need it, see. Okay, so there's that. And even if they did, I wouldn't get it.  So there's that on top, then. See, these're personal matters.
We need more -
...Yah, well, you stay away from Scotty now -
One hunnert's the best we can do here.
Ah, well, we haven't had to run around like you. When're you due?
I thought you'd never ask. The older one is Janet, she's nine, and the younger one is Morgan.
Oh, don't be silly.
So he says, 'So I get it, so you think I'm some kinda jerk for askin',' only he doesn't use the word jerk.
And then he calls me a jerk and says the last guy who thought he was a jerk was dead now. So I don't say nothin' and he says, 'What do ya think about that?'  So I says, 'Well, that don't sound like too good a deal for him then.'
No. Like I say, he was funny-looking. More'n most people even.
The financials are pretty thorough, so the only thing we don't know is your fee.
Wade's got a point there. I'll handle the call if you want, Jerry.
So you're goin' to the Gophers on Sunday?
Yah.
I wonder if I could take just a minute of your time here -
...You're the owner here, Mr. Lundegaard?
...Mr. Lundegaard?
Yah. Yah. Home a Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox.
Yah, no, I'm kinda - I'm kinda busy -
So how do you - have you done any kind of inventory recently?
but do you know that for sure without -
I know, but - well, how do you establish that, sir? Are the cars, uh, counted daily or what kind of -
... I'm sorry, sir?
...If it's so damned important to ya!
Yah, real good. How you doin'?
I mean send it over. I'll shoot it right over to ya.
Yah.
Yah.
Yah, you bet. It's in the lot there. Brand-new burnt umber Ciera.
Stan Grossman called.
You're sayin' that we put in all the money and you collect when it pays off?
A million dollars is a lot a damn money! And there they are, they got my daughter!
Well, yah, but he had a buddy there. He, uh -
Hiya, Lou.
Okay, so we got a state trooper pulls someone over, we got a shooting, and these folks drive by, and we got a high-speed pursuit, ends here, and this execution-type deal.
How we doin' on that vehicle?
Gotta eat a breakfast, Marge.  I'll fix ya some eggs.
...I'll fix ya some eggs.
Heck, it's been such a long time, Mike. It's great to hear from ya.
You're livin' in Edina, then?
Huh? Oh, okay, I'm sorry.
And then I, and then I been workin' for Honeywell for a few years now.
Yah, I, uh... She had leukemia, you know...
...I'm sorry... I shouldn't a done this... I thought we'd have a really terrific time, and now I've...
Well, associating with criminals, if you're the one they talked to, that right there would be a violation of your parole and would end with you back in Stillwater.
Hello?
...Hello?
Mm. But ya think he's all right? saw him last night and he's -
Well, it was nothin' specific he said, it just seemd like it all hit him really hard, his wife dyin' -
So... they didn't...
His wife. This guy says she was kidnapped last Wednesday.
Gustafson's accountant.
Oh, I'm almost back - I'm driving around Moose Lake.
Copy.
You bet. Thanks for lunch. What do we got here, Arbie's?
They're good, Norm, but you're better'n them.
You shouldn't be on your feet too much, you got weight you're not used too. How's the food down there?
Was it reasonable?
Your mallard?
Hautman's blue-winged teal got the twenty-nine cent. People don't much use the three-cent.
Yah.
Oh, my.
I'm tellin' ya.
No!  Look at you!  You're... you're running around in ski masks, exploding things...
I need to know where Tyler is.  Can't you help me?
Look at my face.  I'm a member.  I just need to know if you've seen Tyler Durden.
You are a moron.
Yes.  We're men.  Men is what we are.
Better than I've ever been in my life.
You are?!
I'm going to need you out-of-town a little more this week.  We've got some "red-flags" to cover.
This is Detective Stern with the arson unit.  We have some new information about the "incident" at your condo.
No, you can't die of insomnia.
You need to lighten up.
Red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-red Seconals.
These are my groups.  I was here first.  I've been coming for a year.
Look, I can't cry with a faker present.
Um... Marla, should we maybe exchange numbers?
In case we want to switch nights.
Look, this is a bad time...
Except for their humping, Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.
I don't know ...
This is a sweet side of you.  Picking these up for ...  "Mrs. Haniver" and... "Mrs. Raines." Where are they?
There?
Here.
I don't know.
That... sawing and hammering.
The Paper Street Soap Company.
He's not here.
What kind of stupid question is that?!
I don't want to hear anything you've got to say.
Because... I'm Tyler Durden.
Let go of me!
Leave me alone!  I don't ever want to see you again!
What happened... ?
My God, you're shot...
Who did this to you?
You were standing right where you are now, asking how good our security is. It's tight as a drum.
Baggage handlers.  But when a suitcase vibrates, the throwers have to call the police.
We have front row seats for this Theater of Mass Destruction.  The Demolitions Committee of Project Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns of ten buildings with blasting gelatin.  In two minutes, primary charges will blow base charges, and those buildings will be reduced to smoldering rubble.  I know this because Tyler knows this.
Two, equal parts gasoline and diet cola.  Three, dissolve kitty-litter in gasoline until the mixture is thick.
Insurance'll cover it.
What list?
I don't... think so.
Well, I have to file a claim...
Why would anyone want this shitty job?
-- Like splicing single frames from adult movies into family films.
A nice, big cock.
... Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.
The fight.
I know that.
You?
You're okay with this?
She is a wild, twisted bitch.  Stay away from that one.
Hey... don't knock librarians.
She needs an exorcist.  This isn't love.  This is sport-fucking.
You want to finish her off?
You get rid of her.
As the fat renders, the tallow floats to the surface.  Remember the crap they taught you in Boy Scouts.
Stop it.  This is your pain -- your burning hand.  It's right here.  Look at it.
I... I think I understand.  I think I get it...
... Marla ... ?
Tyler...
Where did you go, Psycho-Boy?
What do you want?  A statement of purpose... ?
We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world.  We are all part of the same compost heap...
What the hell ... ?!
I want to hear the truth.
You broke your promise.  You talked to her about me.
People think that you're me, because you and I happen to share the same body.
Oh, yeah.  I didn't really know my Dad...
You have jobs.
You could be standing under 37 stories of steel and concrete with a 150 gallons of nitroglycerin strapped to the support... oh, maybe it couldn't be...
I'm pulling the green wire.
One minute.
Can't you call it off... ?
What the fuck -- ?
If I leave, you will be right back where I found you...
What are you doing?
Why do you want to do that? Why do you want to put that gun in your mouth?
Why are you going with this, Ikea- boy?
Abort the plan.
But, this is Project Mayhem.
What list?
The survivors of Flight 180 died in the exact order they were originally meant to die in the plane crash. That was Death's original design.
If you have the same power as Alex, you'll be seeing signs soon.  When you see anything creepy or ominous, an in-your-face irony kinda thing? Don't ignore it.  It usually means the difference between life and death.
I was driving a white van.  It must've gone out of control because it crashed into a lake and I drowned.  It was...horrible.
Please, what else could it mean?
Are you crazy?  What makes you think you'd survive?
Six duds in a row.
Remember the onramp?  There was a pregnant woman in a white delivery van.
Dano, shouldn't we go back and help your mother?
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
What?
First I'm stuck with Jury Duty, now this nonsense.
I got that beat.  So like, last May, I was supposed to stay at this cheesy bed and breakfast in Pennsylvania. There was a major gas leak no one knew about and all the guests suffocated during the night.
Billboards about accidents.  Kids yelling "pile up" for no reason. It all felt...just wrong. Just like... 
I didn't.  Until I was dispatched to clean up one of the Flight 180 survivors.
Guys, let's not panic.  Isabella's safe.
You can't cheat destiny.  I know what I have to do to save us.  I have to die.
Want me to drive?
This trip better be worth it. What's the guy-girl ratio again?
What is it?  What are you?
When I die.  Is it gonna hurt?
I know this is the first time we've been apart since.  But everything's gonna be okay.
Your mother would have been so proud of the way you've handled yourself through all of this...
Kimberly?  It's Dad.
Your car's leaking either transmission or brake fluid.  I want you to have it checked ASAP at a gas station.
I know it's crazy, but I'm really scared for the others.  I've got this terrible feeling.
I'm sorry.  I'm just so happy that you're safe.
You're all certifiable, you know that?  I can't believe I've been listening to this crap.  Come on, Tim, let's go outside.
Mom?
You went there? I've wanted to go there, but I thought it was off limits.
"It?"
4:25.
Most kids do, I guess.
Billy told the F.B.I. he saw you runnin' away from her house.
Alright, Browning, you fuckin' warlock... did you know about Ms. Lewton, or what?
Man, that is one George Michael notch from being gay.
Please tell me I'm gonna get to see the Jets win the Super Bowl.
Sorry, I mean... I talk to people all the time... I know a lot of them aren't there.  But this is real, isn't it?  You're taking me home now?
What's that?
Your buddy made it out last night. The place went apeshit.
... then proceed downriver to extraction at point Echo Delta. Doyle takes us out by helicopter, we all live happily ever after and that's the last time, Rambo!  I swear to Christ.
Gettin' old, huh?
This place is a trip.
Snoring.  Five, six guys. Mumbling... Vietnamese.  Somebody talking in his sleep.  A toilet flushing.
Roundeye.
Torture cage.  Can't stand... can't sit... for days.  Sometimes weeks.
You better take off.
Brewer!  You know what that thing's packing?
Why's that?
How did you get started working for the spooks?
And how'd you sneak up like that?
You try get across Laos?  Get to Thailand?
What was that?
Stay on your heading, Captain.
Where?
All this is for us?
It's not necessary.
Who're you?
What's your name?
This will last you one year after which you have the option to renew if... you like at a membership discount.
My parents were divorced.
Fine.
What?
I think some people are meant to be alone.  Maybe I was a man in a former life and I used women for pleasure so now I'm paying for it - which would be fine, if I could just remember some of the pleasure parts... 
No really..I can't.
Getting your nails done is one thing but going to dinner with a bunch of strangers and <u>him</u>... She didn't even look at him.
Most men are.
Holdin' my penis... What a lovely way of sayin' how Much ya like me...
Yep! Right on it!
Are you in a mood today baby? Is this one of those days when you're in ...whadda call it... an emotional abyss?  Talk to me, cause I don't understand these moods.
... So... where did you sleep last night?
He's not a moron.
Lydia is the girl Parry likes... And I thought, if I could get them together I...
I don't know... He's a little disgusting... Although some women go for that.
You're kidding!  What did he say?
What?
You can't even give me that?!  What were you gonna do, Jack?... Just gonna organize your life...  ... walk out that door, move in by yourself and what -- drop the news when you find somebody else?  What were you planning to do, Jack?
So, Edwin, baby, this is Sunrise Confession time... what have you got for us?
No, Jack, no, it's not... She likes me.
Yeah, well... I let him stay there. What else could I do after such a tragedy?
No...no...we can't...we can't..
Remember. One chorus and out.
It's O.K...It's O.K...Lets me help you up.
Huh-huh.
So how do we do this?
God, I have no idea.  She's worked here for fifteen years and I have no idea.  I'll call her.
Please don't hurt me?
I need a drink.
This is it. I'm in hell. Damned to an eternity of idiotic conversation.
No... thanks... Listen --
They said you're The One.
A quest?
The Little...
I think you're a very nice... very nice psychotic man.  I really appreciate what you did for me.  It was a very brave and noble thing...
Parry.
Thanks... You can keep the doll.
Do you follow her every day?
What's her name?
That's O.K.
Isn't it great up here... He's gone now, but we had him on the run! We would've had his ass if we had horses! He's running scared!
SAW WHO!!?
It's such a great song.
.....What are you doing?
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!!
Happily married, probably.
...I feel so much for her...I feel like something awful is going to happen.
Parry, it's Lydia Sinclair - our membership winner.
Beautiful night huh?
Are you all right?
...I..uh..I get to read some of the books but mostly I..just calculate production costs from first edition hard cover publication to paperback. After paperback it's basically someone else's problem.
We mostly publish trashy romance novels.
Tell me more. I want to know everything.
Well, it's enough for me.
I don't drink coffee...
Oh no, I want to.  I've got a hard-on for you the size of Canada... but I don't... want just one night.  I have a confession to make?
That's a wig you wear, isn't it?
We gotta get on home an' relieve the sitter. Why'nt you an' Ray come on over.
Give 'em the horn, Bob.
Tell me what in the hell's going on, Elton!
You're not going to play it again.
Is it my turn again?
Just one minute, you! Don't you ever talk to me like that!
Are you depressed about your daddy, honey?
You're depressed that I come along.
It's all right. He don't mean anything by that.
Look at my car! Piece of shit! I just bought it brand new from a used-car lot, and the steering goes to the pot on me!
I had to leave this place. I got depressed, seeing all the crap. And the thing is, they're making more crap, you know? They've got so many stores and stuff and junk full of crap, I can't believe it.
Can I get you anything else?
Only what's on the menu...  A Number Two: Plain omelette. It comes with cottage fries and rolls.
You want me to hold the chicken.
No, I'm not...  I'm not.
Oh.
I have to talk seriously with you...
Well...  I better let you...
Oh God, I'm so glad, Robert, that you're coming...
Oh no... Why? What is it? The way I look?
It's none of your business!
Nothing.
Up to now, what I've been getting from you are meaningful looks over the dinner table and a lot of vague suggestions about the day after tomorrow...
No, I want to talk to you now. I have to explain something about...
No. It's useless, Robert. It wouldn't work, not ever...
And living out here, in this rest home asylum, that's what you want?
Four or five years.
That's three games to none, Carl.
Oh, for chrissakes...
I don't understand why you had to stay in a motel. There's more than enough room here.
Come on, Terry, we got a ride!
In my personal observation, I think that more people are neat than are clean...
Pardon me?
The choice of words, "squashed flat," juxtaposed against the image of a fluffy kitten...
I'd like to remind you again, this isn't an opera or a musical comedy.
What?
For once in your life have some 	respect for me, don't even curse at me or nothin'.
I told you, no. I'm not that type.
Yo.
So you got a girl?
I look good, that's it. So what else do you do for these girls?
See, I got you, you are so scared. I don't believe that you kissed no girls. That you got three girls and that you faithful and this and that.
Why don't you ask Eddie?
Forget it! C'mon Let's go to the pool.
Oh man, what we gotta leave ar' own neighborhood for?
Yo! What you goin' for
Yeah, he got boxes in his stomach. He's taller than me.
I think he's 18 or 17.
How do I know you're not lying.
No.
I feel like dirt. They even want to know what he's doing in Utah?
Yes sir, you are confirmed on Flight 306 to Rio tomorrow evening at 11 PM. First Class.
What?
I don't know how he doesn't know. He doesn't know.
Hey, what are you doing?
What? What are you talking about?
You decorate this yourself or did Mrs. Chief of Police help you?
Why are you doing this Mr. Fletch?
Your editor called me yesterday to respond to allegations you're about to print about police involvement in narcotics dealing. Fletch starts to get up, but Cummings plants his foot on Fletch's chest, forces him back down.
After I shoot you, I stick the knife in my arm, then place it in your dead hand. Self-defense. We don't do this very much anymore... but we have. Got rid of a lot of minorities that way.
I hate the beach. Wouldn't go there if you paid me. Besides, I'm way overdue on my story about off-track betting in the Himalayas. You don't think it's the mafia, do you?
Right, and how long have you had these pains, Mr. Barber?
Two bs?
That's two.
Arnold Babar. Isn't there a children's book about an elephant named Babar?
Oh, I don't belong formally. I've gone with my aunt.
Is she ever. I've got some stories....
It was. Really a shame. To go so suddenly.
I hope they still fit. Do I get to keep the glove?
No idea at all?
What, the heat here?
You gonna nail the chief?
Noooo. Free snort. That's it.
You find the source?
I did not break nor enter. I simply chose an advisable location to await my client's delinquent husband.
Good evening.
I'm Harry S. Truman from Casewell Insurance Underwriters.
My parents were great fans of the former President.
They busted me last week.
Fat Sam is turning state's evidence.
He wrote me a nice deposition. He says he just received the drugs. You did the selling.
Sure you did.
I'm still here.
What's the difference? The noise'll kill you first.
Fine. After you kill me, take the Jaguar. The keys will be in the glove compartment.
Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM.
Yo!
'Stanwyk's parents, Marvin and Velma Stanwyk, also of Provo, were unable to attend the wedding.'
Nothing on Gail Stanwyk, nothing on Jim Swarthout. But I did ---
I overheard it. He thinks you're completely out of control, he said he was gonna can you as soon as he got the story. If I were you, I'd just chuck it, Fletch. Screw him. Let him eat three full pages on Sunday.
I just thought... sure.  Sally Ann Cavanaugh.
Cute young thing, too.
Do you happen to have a picture of Alan and his wife?
Oh, that's all right, I've got lots more. Want to see the reception?
Huh? No, not my wedding. Yours.
John who?
Alan's in Utah.
Hi.
Have you gotten cuter since I last saw you?
'But we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.'
Can I ask you a question?
Why'd you let me in?
What about his parents?
I'll be leaving now, Mrs. Stanwyk.
A four hundred dollar lunch tab!
What are you talking about?
No.
Oh God, I hate things that start like that....
What is this....
Are you telling me my husband is a bigamist???
I thought you had this all figured out. Good going 'Irwin.'
I was supposed to meet Mrs. Cavanaugh.
I'm calling the cops. This is for the cops.
Fletch.
Two...
Oh, I hate it when he calls me that.
I will, Frank, I will. Something came up, okay?
Now, Irwin, try to follow me. You can't run the ad and then not run the story.
Just kidding, Frank. You'll have the story and you'll be damn proud of it.
What's 'practically'? Is it Fat Sam? You said you had pictures of him....
He threw me in a cell, took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if I didn't promise to give up the story.
Thanks for the vote of confidence, Frank.
I was upset.
Who's Frieda?
I said, I ain't got you...
No thanks.  I carry my own.
Five thousand should be enough to assuage any qualms you have about my family tree.
Actually, you may take it all now.
Ouch... Of course I want off the case.  Some monster from Woodstock tried and succeeded in killing me tonight.  The fact I'm alive's a technicality.
Jonathan was such a beautiful man. No one knew him like I did... Excuse me.  I can't do this now. I'll call you tomorrow.
I'm not cynical.  Can I help it that life is a disease and everyone's a victim. So you're producing exclusively for Grendel Records now.  Hope you're taking Julian for a bundle.
Have a copy of that sent to me, will ya?
I do it for love.
You're friends with the most obnoxious asshole on the airwaves. The King of the Shock Jocks.  I'm, I'm shocked.
That's for me... Radio contests, really Ford, how tacky...
So what about this watch?
Quiet.  Tell me you tapped in the police computer and found out lots of good stuff about Art Mooney...
Why did you interrupt?  Maxwell seemed like he wanted to hire me.
I wish I knew.  You did good work...
Thanks.  You interested.  It's festival seating, so...
What?  Jesus, tell me!
Zuzu Petals, you're not bad.  In fact, I was discussing this whole rock-n-roll thing with my pal Art Mooney the other day.  You know him?
Yeah, it's weird.  Bobby and Johnny were such good friends...
Why are you depressed?  You get in all the clubs, you never pay cover...
My axe!
This is boring, guys.
Nice left you got there, jerk.
This way...
Oh how sweet, your friend's got his own star.
Fairlane, you gonna find out who killed the lead singer of Black Vomit?
Gut feeling.
I got something serious to dis-cuss.
Ouch.
Yeah, go on...
It's me.
I need someone to help me with my case load, you interested?  This whole father/son thing, if you're not into it, I mean, it's okay. You know what I'm saying?
Nice tie, Lt. Anus, sir.
What are you running from?
Case closed, okay?  Thirty seconds.
Good to meet you, Mr. Fairlane. Your mouth makes quite a reflection.  I'm Julian Grendel.
Well, hello, Ford.
<u>Okay</u>!  Okay.  You got me.  Boy, you guys are tough.  I have the third disc.  Indeed.  I.  Do. Yes, sir.  Yeah you assholes, it's in a very safe place with instructions to have it sent directly to the police if I don't make a phone call by seven o'clock.  So if you'll excuse us...
I just gave up smoking.  A last drink?
When I say 'no,' run for the door.
Shit.
Do you really know everybody in the industry?
You heard that Bobby Vomit O.D.'d, right?  Do you suspect foul play and stuff?
So...
I am told it is difficult to pay the phone bill with gold chains and V.C.R.s.  There's four thousand here.
What's my name?
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Calm down -- Henri!  You must trust me -- this is an extremely complicated situation to which there is a simple solution if you do exactly what I tell you.  It's worth more money to you.
Everything's smooth.  Beautiful.  I will need a few more days though, the boys think we oughta cool it for awhile -- make sure there's no heat.
Oh Alain!  C'est merveilleux!  Tu me gâtes.  Je t'aime.  Attends, je vais te montrer moi aussi ce que j'ai acheté.
Sale boulot.
I don't know.  Boca is scared. He's not strong enough.  He sees policemen in his soup.
If this bridge were in Europe, it would be on every tourist's sight- seeing list.
There may be two... no, three who could fit it.
A Mr. Paul Ganapolos, he's here alone.
They'll close you down if they ever get a look at those busted-valise broads you run with.
Yeah.  In the late innings.  Ya look like a night's sleep wouldn't kill ya.
Yeah, we got the Westbury covered like a tent.
That's crazy.  You lost the Frog in the subway and you blew our cover. If they haven't moved already they're not gonna move now.
Havin' trouble?  You're a dumb guinea.
Toy wit' this will ya.
I'm goin' check on this address in the Bronx, if you're bullshitting me, it's your ass.
We got information that there's no shit in the street -- it's like a desert full of junkies with a big score coming in to make everybody well.
Popeye.
The guy's a frog -- I'm pretty sure. Also he made me.  Stayin' on four but went up to six -- cute.
My ass.  The only reason you're in this is because you've got a big expense account for buying junk and you like to see your picture in the papers.
Same car.
It was a crematorium.
So whatta you want a badge?  It's your first major league game Sal. One thing I learned, move calmly, move cautiously.  You'll never be sorry.
What are you saying?
Let me tell you what I know, Daryl.  You went to Saint Xavier with Mary.  You lived five blocks from her.  You liked her.  But she ain't interested.  That must've hurt, huh?
You got a collar in here for the Nightingale murders?
I'm working with one of the victims outta Brooklyn North.  You mind I take a shot at him?
They around?
Where's the collar, in the cells?
Why haven't they killed the juice?
Oh, man.  Hope it ain't like this in Baltimore tomorrow.
Gotta be another way up, Frank.
What's the matter, Jules?  Trouble workin' an eight hour shift, watching the kid and whipping up a little bolognese?
Butch called.
He did.
I've been talking to Johnny...on the radio.
Jules, I want you to say hello to somebody...  I'm on with John - that guy I told you about.
Hey, bud.
Okay, I'm on it.  Hey.
Frank, we need to talk...
About what?
I wanna be wrong here.  But we need to go to the precinct and talk about it.
You ready?
Uh, hello?
Whatta ya know.  Bayside, born and raised.
Sorry 'bout that.  So Queens, you psyched for the Series?
What are you talking about?  I'm talking about this afternoon.
Gordo, if this is you, so help me...
Now you listen to me.  My name is John Francis Sullivan, I live at 1060 41st, where I've lived my whole life.  And I saw the first game of the '69 Series at my Uncle Butch's house with my father...
Oh my god.
You just burned the desk.
That's impossible.
Thirty-five?  That would make it...
You're still my Little Chief, right?
No wait, don't go!
Why?
But that's tomorrow.
What?  Johnny, what's wrong?
What?  What is it?
Whatta you mean...
What are you talking about?
So what should I do?  Call the police? You think they'll believe me?
I'll be damned.
Got it.
What else, John.  It must be different, huh?  Are people living on the moon?
Yeah, you betcha.
I don't think I can.  I'm not a cop.  I can't.   I can't stop this guy.
He took your wallet?
Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.
Please, Dad, just do it.
I got it.
Hey, Sull.  My cable's out again.
How you feeling?
My father didn't die in a fire?
That's what we need here, Satch.  A lucky break.
Our lucky break.  Mario ID'd the dental. Mary Finelli...reported missing April 16, 1968.
Okay, lemme walk you through it.
Not the first time that's been true.  I'm telling you, I got a feeling about this guy.  This is the guy, Satch.
Got a minute?
Fine.  You know Dr. Schwartz retired last month?
Then I'll bet she's real proud of you, huh?
Wife around?
Who the fuck is this?
That's an eyeball!  Oh, God!
No more... I can't!
What're you doin'?
Hey Deb... can you hear me?
Do you want a beer or not?
What's the matter?!
Which one is it?
You haven't changed a bit.  Always so sure of yourself.  Even when we were kids, when you wanted something, nothing could stop you.
Look what I found.  Remember these?
You know him?
Hi.
What are we gonna do?
That scarecrow?  Can't you tell how weird his is just by looking at him.
Please... be cool.
Are they following us?
Got any good ideas?
This is no time to celebrate!
Bullseye!
This has been on helluva beginning to a quiet weekend in the country.
We're really sorry, but it wasn't our fault.
You've just learned a valuable lesson.  A beautiful girl like you should never go out in the dark alone.
I thought that was the end of the song.
Will you hurry up!  I gotta get this fuckmobile back before Horace finds out I took it.
Will you slow down?  It's hard enough to read this thing.
You admit the sign did say "Camp Forest Green," with an arrow pointing this way.
Darren, we better turn around.
That's right.  Just drive toward him.  He'll move.  Nobody wants to die.
....with a woman's touch.
That's your problem, Larry. That's why your sales are always below quota.  Your instinct to eat is stronger than your instinct to win.
But, Dad, we...
When are you going to stop treating me like one!
Yeah, hi.  Listen, I've got to talk to your dad.  About Jason. I've got a plan.  I need to buy some things first but mainly need help to...
Okay, give it back.
Are you sure this is gonna work? I mean, why didn't we bring that gun and just blast him away?
Whew...Okay, hand me those padlocks.
You mean you had a bad dream.
I can't believe no one called back.  I better...
It's just that Darren and Lizbeth are in charge of organizing and setting up the new campgrounds.
Now you better cool out a minute, boy.  You already almost got your head blown to pieces.
And you've been at some psychiatric clinic ever since, haven't you?
Why didn't you cremate him?!
Don't concern yourself, Martin. This boy needs treatment.  We're taking care of it.  Sorry for the disturbance.
Doesn't that tell you something?!
Well, let's hope not!
Mr. Duke tonight I'm prepared to offer you your sum of one hundred thousand dollars, payable only after you provide American Casefile with incontrovertible proof of --
You have to...save...Jessica... Save Jessica and save the...
Steven...
Maybe you should be moving on.
Get up!
Where the fuck is she, Duke?!
Tell me!
Lock this asshole up.
Jesus, Steven, that's...that's really lovely.
What are you doing?
Wanna know how I did that?
I'll be back later.  You just be cool, okay.
Don't do anything stupid.
I'm gonna get your outta this.  Just hang tight.  Okay?
How many times do you want to hear this?
I've told you the truth.
You call what you did bad?!  You knocked her up and then left her!
Have you seen Tamara?
But she might be in trouble...
I hear the crew members are cute guys in their twenties.
No thanks.
It's not that, it's just that...  It I get caught, I'll lose my science scholarship and everything.
That was truly excellent.
What murders?
And I'll never do it again. Forgive me?
What are you doing in here?
You have no right...
She doesn't know what she wants. She's never had a stable life.
She's fine, Charles. Take it easy...
But that doesn't prove that he's the one!
Did you find Rennie?
He's doing the best he can, Charles.
I doubt very much that one even exists.
There must be a phone around here somewhere.
What a beautiful day.
You've been coming out here every summer for the last three years, young lady, and you still haven't learned how.
Oh, he is indeed. And ready to pull down anybody who falls in and can't swim.
You're making a big mistake, Rennie. It's not too late to put you back on land.
You had me worried to death!
Can't we at least talk about it?
You pushed me...
Everything okay?
Rennie -- I was just on my way over to your room
I seem to detect a hint of ingenuousness in your tone.  In other words, level with me.
Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you?
Did you have an accident in the lake?
The Captain and Chief Engineer... they've been...they're dead.
I think so. But we have to lower the anchors so we don't drift any further...
We'll be okay. I want you to wait by the lifeboats, just in case.
But Rennie...
I used to be head of neurosurgery. Big hospital in USSR. This hospital, I'm not kidding.
Say it again.
Nicky. I was thinking about you. I went to the preview last night.
Don't talk like that.
We must abandon.
You used to love life. You don't exude this any more.
You mean because What's-His-Name.
It's just a review.
I'm not ready.
Let's work on it.
This could be it.
Does it feel comfortable?
She died.
Peter Redmond. They found out why he can't remember his lines. There's something living in his brain. A parasite he picked up in Borneo, doing the movie.
They're watching him closely. There's a special rehearsal set for this afternoon. To bolster his confidence. And that's not all.
Ever since he started reviewing the Broadway theater, nobody in this business has been worried about anything else.
You mean the World Series? I thought the Red Sox were winning.
I used to tell myself. Talent is more erotic when it's wasted. Will I see you tonight?
I never see you anymore. Where are you all day?
Mother won't tell me how long you've been seeing this person. She's embarrassed to tell me. So why don't you tell me?
Can we talk later? Will you be at the party?
What will we talk about?
I see the outline of your body in chalk on this very floor.
Why won't you tell me your name?
What else?
I have this thing where I have to know a person is being honest with me before, you know, I can feel completely free to be myself.
What do we want?
Am I really so deeply repugnant?
What else?
See, Daddy.
I've been looking for you because I want to let you know what's been going on before you read about it in a gossip column.
What's it like to shoot somebody?
People are dependable.
It's Stanley. It's the Steamer. Fate has spoken to this man in the depths of the night.
Who is it?
Go way. I'll call a cop.
Where the hell are you?
What do you want?
Lillian says it once a week. `Why doesn't he come live with us?'
Of course they're gonna lose. We'll watch them lose. What good is heartbreak if we don't experience it firsthand?
You'll need these. Tonight. For the play.
Where's your elastic brace?
You're Frankie Lazzaro. The gangster from Rhode Island.
Then say it.
This is something no one has been privileged to see in almost seventy years. Very few people now alive can say that they have seen what you are about to see, Matthew. The Red Sox win a World Series. This is deeply, intensely personal. All the mistakes I've made, all the envy, fear and violence that's encased in this little envelope we call a person -- all washed away in the next few minutes. And your grandmother knows why.
This could be it!
Then they lost?
If they lost tonight, they'll lose tomorrow. It's all over.
I was six years old the day Pesky hesitated throwing home and Slaughter scored all the way from first. That's when I knew the Red Sox were my team. Pity and terror.
And you're not saying that because of the gun in my hand?
Sidney remains optimistic.
Yes.
So does Elliot.
Oh. You know him.
And he has finer moments now and then.
Endearing.
I'm trying to prolong our afternoon. In case you haven't noticed.
He wears a disguise.
If I'm sleeping with him, and I haven't said I am, then so what?
Not if you stopped hurting people. Write the truth gently.
Here, you see? Even the South African papers apologize -- "a monstrous attack."
Sora was sent to tell me I -- I must rake and cover the latrine.
God gave you ten thumbs.
You'd be Gandhi --  ...I thought you'd be bigger.
You're a clergyman.
I'm sure your legs are quite as handsome as mine.
You mean Gandhi?
What was he like?
I'll take your luggage back, baas.
Maybe I'm wrong... maybe we're not ready yet. In South Africa the numbers were small...
You're an ambitious man.
Do you remember much of South Africa?
It has. But you'd be surprised. They understand -- they really do. It's not the workers you have to worry about.
After what they did at the massacre -- it's only an eye for an eye.
I must say when I first saw you as a bumbling lawyer here in Bombay I never thought I'd be greeting you as a national hero.
I am beginning to know Mr. Nehru.
In England, I was a poor student but I --
You mean you employ Mr. Baker as your attorney, but you can't walk down the street with him?
I don't know who they've left out there to do the work. There can't be one mine left open. Have they touched the women?
...There's been no time to keep figures, but there must be ninety -- a hundred thousand under arrest.  And it still goes on.
He was right. It's insane -- anything would have been better.
Is there any reason you'd want a left-handed child?
I'm sorry, there's no way we can.
I'll run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections--
The skin flake was found in Michael's Restaurant. The employees are all accounted for.
He was afraid of being exposed.  That's why he did it.
Don't underestimate these imposters.
It's not <i>exactly</i> him.
Hello.
Don't be deceived, Irene.  These are just the clothes.  He has to wear them. Something I could never do.
What about this?
God, what <i>wouldn't</i> you do to leave the planet?
What an act of benevolence--a service to the community.  So that's it.  Now there's nothing between you and ignition.
That's not the point.
I gotta stop!!  I gotta stop!!
A day or so.
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.
You know I wasn't drunk--I knew what I was doing when I walked in front of that car--
Where?
And keep your lashes on your lids where they belong.  How could you be so careless?
So it's not just the Hoovers who've got you rattled.
If you say so.  The stripe.
Where are you taking her?
We'll still be able to talk when I'm away. The conversation will just keep getting longer.
Anything I've forgotten?
No problem.  Before he dropped out he was an honor student, the right majors--
Yeah.
You can wear lifts.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean anything.
Does it have a name?
What about the car?
Who are they?
I can't.
What is it?
Jerome...never shy.  Pisses on command. You've got a beautiful cock.  I ever told you that, Jerome?
The doctor will give you something.
You gotta be kidding.
I guess it was because I was a model prisoner.
What about them?
Rudy Butler, Frank Jackson...
You hired Jackson and Rudy., not me.
A simple reason, McCoy. The obvious reason. To rob a bank.
A little more was taken out before.  My brother's a director of that Bank, Mr. McCoy... I had a few pressing debts.
Where did you get those?
How does it taste?
You been okay?
Boring.
How was it?
$250,000 right off the top.
Keep going over these. I don't want anybody getting lost.
I feel like the night before the first day of school.
It will be such a relief not to have to think about it any more.
You know I've actually gotten tired waiting sometimes... worn out waiting.
Why?
So what. I've got to give him his money. That was our end of the deal.
Why didn't you tell me?
Yeah.
There better be a guy with the
When we had trouble before it was different.
What do you want to do?
We'll grab a room for tonight then you go out tomorrow and buy yourself some new clothes, pick some up for me... Grab some food now, paper bag it, we eat in the room.
You've got it all figured.
What?
Only one car.
Where are you going?
Do what I tell you, it's not a game.
I want to say something.
We got this far.
Ten. Laughlin's going to take us across at four A.M.
Jeep. There's a dry river bed fifteen miles east. He takes us to the Mexican side, drops us off at the airfield by breakfast... we've got a 9 o'clock flight.
You're crazy.
Come on, come on.
Whatever happens... we're going all the way.
That's right.
Where's home?
Yeah. I got out.
I 'm handling the fine stuff. You're back up all the way...
Drive.
I guess you ain't gonna shoot me, are you?
Don't you want to go to the airport?
Listen... how much money did you make this year?
Sure am.
Is it possible, Mrs. Clinton?
What kind of car do you have, Harold?
The three of us are going to do some traveling. We're going to take your car to El Paso.
Cliff Brumby. He'd seen the film. He wanted to meet Doreen.
Do you want to be dead, Albert?
What did you do?  Albert?
What did he say?
What do you want?
Can I go now?
What about?
Hold it!   Hold it!  Who killed Frank, Margaret?
Why'd you see him so regular?
What was bugging Frank?
You know Sid Fletcher?
I know him too.
He came to see Mr Kinnear.
To the demon king's castle, of course.
Is he coming here?
What kind of entertaining?
Does Brumby get a kick out of that crap?
It's a bloody funny thing. You know a bloke for six bloody years and all the time he's as calm as gentle Jesus...  ...then he goes and does a thing like that.  It's a bloody funny thing.
Let her go. She'll be OK.  Sorry about that.
Thanks for coming.
Come off it. Frank was... well... straight. He had no worries I know. Hell, we worked together every day for a year. It would have showed.
It just would. He was always the same.
You work here, Keith?
Ta.
What the bloody hell do you think you're at?
What you going to do?
You coming back?
Oh, I'm straight.  Respectable.
Oh, you've been watching television.
That's not always a healthy way to be...
Yes, I retained that, Eric.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift, Eric?
You're finished, Jack. You know that, don't you? I've bloody finished you.
You couldn't win an egg and spoon race, Eric.
Eh? Have a drink.
If I'd known, I'd have fixed him up with something better.
We know why you're all steamed up, and so do Gerald and Sid.
Bollock naked with his socks still on?
Are we here to play cards or talk about the old days?
Oh... I think I'll stay as I am.
I'll see you, then.
How about that, Jack?  Old Harry thought I was having him on.
Deadbeats all.
You did?
You had one you'd know it.  Patel. They keep coming up.  I don't know. They like to talk to salesmen.  They're lonely, something.  They like to feel superior, I don't know.  Never bought a fucking thing. You're sitting down "The Rio Rancho this, the blah blah blah," "The Mountain View--" "Oh yes.  My brother told me that..." They got a grapevine.  Fuckin' Indians, George. Not my cup of tea.  Speaking of which I want to tell you something:  I never got a cup of tea with them. You see them in the restaurants.  A supercilious race.  What is this look on their face all the time?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Their broads all look like they just got fucked with a dead cat, I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't like it. Christ...
The whole fuckin' thing...The pressure's just too great.  You're ab...you're absolu...they're too important.  All of them.  You go in the door.  I..."I got to close this fucker, or I don't eat lunch," "or I don't win the Cadillac..." We fuckin' work too hard.  You work too hard.  We all, I remember when we were at Platt...huh?  Glen Ross Farms... didn't we sell a bunch of that..."
...this shit...
It's too...
The nurses?
River Oaks, Brook Farms.  All of that shit.  Somebody told me, you know what he's clearing himself? Fourteen, fifteen grand a week.
What do you need? A telephone, some broad to say "Good morning," nothing...nothing...
You don't ax your sales force.
You...
What could somebody get for them?
We're just "talking" about it.
You didn't?
Is that what I said?
Yes.
Oh, yes, George.
Are you sure?
I didn't ask to be.
Well, well, well, talk to me, we sat down to eat dinner, and here I'm a criminal...
I'm fine.  You mean the board?  You mean the board...?
Yes.  I'm no fucking good.
They stole...
You think they're going to catch... where are you going?
Yeah.
They aren't?
Where were you?
Yes.
Then don't sweat it, George, you know why?
...that's why I came in.  I thought I...
That's what, that's what, that's what I was trying to do.  That's why I came in...I meet gestapo tac...
Excuse me, fella.
Would you excuse us, please...?
Oh, fuck.  Fuck.  FUCK FUCK FUCK!  WILLIAMSON!!! WILLIAMSON!!!  OPEN THE FUCKING...WILLIAMSON...
Who told you...?
Moss...Who told him?
And I don't want any fucking shit and I don't give a shit, Lingk puts me over the top, you filed it, that's fine, any other shit kicks out you go back.  You...you reclose it, 'cause I closed it and you...you owe me the car.
Aaronow...
Which, wait a second, which is not until the check is cashed.
You have a problem?
Mr. Levene...?
Four.  You had four leads.  One kicked out, one the judge, you say...
Lately kiss my ass lately.  That isn't how you build an org...talk, talk to Murray.  Talk to Mitch. When we were on Peterson, who paid for his fucking car?  You talk to him.  The Seville...?  He came in, "You bought that for me Shelly." Out of what?  Cold calling.  Nothing. Sixty-five, when we were there, with Glen Ross Farms?  You call 'em downtown.  What was that?  Luck? That was "luck"?  Bullshit, John. You're burning my ass, I can't get a fucking lead...you think that was luck.  My stats for those years? Bullshit...over that period of time...?  Bullshit.  It wasn't luck. It was skill.  You want to throw that away, John...?  You want to throw that away?
...it isn't you...?  Who is it? Who is this I'm talking to?  I need the leads...
Then how do they come up above that mark?  With dreck...?  That's nonsense.  Explain this to me. 'Cause it's a waste, and it's a stupid waste.  I want to tell you something...
Money.  A fortune.  Money lying on the ground.  Murray?  When was the last time he went out on a sit? Sales contest?  It's laughable. It's cold out there now, John. It's tight.  Money is tight.  This ain't sixty-five.  It ain't.  It just ain't.  See?  See?  Now, I'm a good man--but I need a...
John.  John...
Of what?
Alright.
Now?  Now?
I wish I could.
Well, I want to tell you something, fella, wasn't long I could pick up the phone, call Murray and I'd have your job.  You know that?  Not too long ago.  For what?  For nothing. "Mur, this new kid burns my ass." "Shelly, he's out." You're gone before I'm back from lunch.  I bought him a trip to Bermuda once...
You want to do business that way...? Alright.  Alright.  Alright. Alright.  What is there on the other list...?
What happened?
Ah, fuck.  Leads!  Leads! Williamson!  Send me out!  Send me out!
How could I tell 'em your sale?  Eh? I don't have a tel...I'll tell 'em your sale when they bring in the leads.  Alright?  Shelly.  Alright? We had a little... You closed a deal.  You made a good sale.  Fine.
Look: I have a lot of things on my mind, they're coming in, alright, they're very upset, I'm trying to make some sense...
The only thing remarkable is who you made it to.
Mmm.
Yes.  I hear you.
Mmm.
How do you know I made it up?
You said, "You don't make something up unless it's sure to help."  How did you know that I made it up?
Well, I'm saying this, Shel: usually I take the contracts to the bank.  Last night I didn't.  How did you know that?  One night in a year I left a contract on my desk. Nobody knew that but you.  Now how did you know that?  You want to talk to me, you want to talk to someone else...because this is my job.  This is my job on the line, and you are going to talk to me.  Now how did you know that contract was on my desk?
If you tell me where the leads are, I won't turn you in.  If you don't, I am going to tell the cop you stole them, Mitch and Murray will see that you go to jail.  Believe me they will.  Now, what did you do with the leads?  I'm walking in that door--you have five seconds to tell me: or you are going to jail.
I sold them to Jerry Graff.
Do I have to tell you?  Moss.
Okay: I...look: I'm going to make it worth your while.  I am.  I turned this thing around.  I closed the old stuff, I can do it again. I'm the one's going to close 'em. I am!  I am! 'Cause I turned this thing a...I can do that, I can do anyth...last night.  I'm going to tell you, I was ready to Do the Dutch.  Moss gets me, "Do this, we'll get well..." Why not.  Big fuckin' deal.  I'm halfway hoping to get caught.  To put me out of my...  But it taught me something.  What it taught me, that you've got to get out there.  Big deal.  So I wasn't cut out to be a thief.  I was cut out to be a salesman.  And now I'm back, and I got my balls back...and, you know, John, you have the advantage on me now: Whatever it takes to make it right, we'll make it right.  We're going to make it right.
What?
What sales...?  I just closed eighty-two grand...Are you fuckin'...I'm back...I'm back, this is only the beginning.
Their check's no good?  They're nuts...?
John: John:...my daughter...
You did that?
Those fuckin' deadbeats...
Give me some leads.  I'm going out... I'm getting out of...
Shit.
Rick.  Let me tell you.  Wait, we're in the...
Get the chalk.  Get the chalk...get the chalk!  I closed 'em!  I closed the cocksucker.  Get the chalk and put me on the board.  I'm going to Hawaii!  Put me on the Cadillac board, Williamson!  Pick up the fuckin' chalk.  Eight units. Mountain View...
Eight units?
"Always be closing..."
Harriett...
The only arrangement I'll accept is full investment.  Period.  The whole eight units.  I know that you're saying 'be safe,' I know what you're saying.  I know if I left you to yourselves, you'd say 'come back tomorrow,' and when I walked out that door, you'd make a cup of coffee...you'd sit down...and you'd think 'let's be safe...' and not to disappoint me you'd go one unit or maybe two, because you'd become scared because you'd met possibility.  But this won't do, and that's not the subject..." Listen to this, I actually said this. "That's not the subject of our evening together." Now I handed them the pen.  I held it in my hand. I turned the contract, eight units eighty-two grand. "Now I want you to sign."  I sat there.  Five minutes.  Then, I sat there, Ricky, twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock.  Twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock.  Not a word, not a motion. What am I thinking? "My arm's getting tired?" No.  I did it.  I did it.  Like in the old says, Ricky.  Like I was taught... Like, like, like I used to do...I did it.
...yes...
Glad to meet you.
Mr. Morton's with American Express... he's...  I can tell Jim what you do...?
Well, Ray was eating at one of his company's men's home in France...the man's French, isn't he?
Ah.  Ah, his wife is.  Ray: what time do you have...?
No.  You said the one.  That's why you said we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.
I'm sorry...?
Rick...?
Yes.
I don't understand.
When did you write the check?
No, no.  That's just something she "said." We don't have to do that.
What...?
To negotiate what?  To negotiate what?
What?  What?  What, Jim: I tell you what, let's get out of here...let's go get a drink.
You cashed the check?
Fuckin' asshole.
Eight units.  Mountain View.
Bring that shit up.  Of my volume. You were on a bad one and I brought it up to you you'd harbor it.  You'd harbor it a long long while. And you'd be right.
I'll show you how to chew it." Your pal closes, all that comes out of your mouth is bile, how fucked up you are...
You closed him yesterday.
Where are you going?
I have the stuff from last year's...
Patel?  Ravidam Patel?  How am I going to make a living on thses deadbeat wogs?  Where did you get this, from the morgue?
What's the fucking point in any case...?  What's the point.  I got to argue with you, I got to knock heads with the cops, I'm busting my balls, sell you dirt to fucking deadbeats money in the mattress, I come back you can't even manage to keep the contracts safe, I have to go back and close them again...What the fuck am I wasting my time, fuck this shit.  I'm going out and reclose last week's...
Three?  I count two.
Yes.
We had a slight burglary last night.
Mr. Lingk.  James Lingk.  Your contract went out.  Nothing to...
...Mr. Williamson...
You've grown so tall... so tall in the last year.  You're much taller than me.
Sit down.  Your Aunt Connie and I waited for you to have some lunch, but now it's all dried out.
Well, thank you, they asked for you all week.
We're going to Europe next week.  I want to get passage booked on the Queen.
Then why do you come to me?
What's 'cent' Anne?'
I wanta dance...whatsa matter with that?
He is weak.
I understand...
Ten to one shot, you said.  Ten to one shot in my favor, and I lose.
My life won't be worth a nickel after tomorrow.
Why'd you do it, Frankie?  After all these years, why'd you turn against him?
Ready, Frankie.
Great, Havana's great.  Lots of activity in Havana!  Anybody I know here.  Five-Angels?  Anybody?
No.  I mean, are you sure?
&quot;Yo soy un hombre sincero...&quot; I am a sincere man, From the land of the palms...
Tonight we've been invited to a reception at the Presidential Palace; to bring in the New Year. You and I will go in a special car that's being sent.  They'll have cocktails... then dinner, and a reception with the President.  When it's over, it will be suggested that you take Questadt and his friends from Washington to spend the night with some women.  I'll go home alone in the car; and before I reach the hotel, I'll be assassinated.
It was never Pentangeli... I've always known that.  It was Roth all along.  He talks to me as a son; as his successor, but the old man thinks he'll live forever.
To go tonight, with me, as though we know nothing.  I've already made my move.
Fredo.  Where are you going?
I was kept pretty much in the dark. I didn't know all that much.
He said there was something good in it for me...me on my own.
Why?  Why does he bother other Italians?
I wish they had.  He takes fifty dollars a week from my father's cash drawer.  But you can't kill a man like Fanucci.
The 'patrone' is here.
I don't know.  I'm sorry, Kay...
... He said he had shot his Grandfather with a gun, and then he died in the garden.  And he asked me... he asked me, Tom, if that meant now his father would shoot him out of... revenge.  How does a four year old boy learn the word... 'revenge'?
What kind of a family is this... are we human beings?  He knows his Father killed his Uncle Carlo.  He heard Connie.
That's the first time I've seen the lawyer side of you, Tom.  It's not your best side.
Why didn't someone tell me!
You're going to talk to him now.
Rocco!
I'm sorry; of course, you know that.
There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom. I know that's upset you in the past; and you've felt that it was because of some lack of trust or confidence.  But it is because I do trust you that I've kept so much secret from you.  It's precisely that at this moment, you are the only one that I can completely trust.  In time, you'll understand everything.
I've prepared this; have had it for over a month.  It won't explain everything; but indicates where I will be, so in a sense, it is my life.  Also, there are three tasks that must be executed immediately.  Pop would have given those to Luca -- You knew Pop as well as anyone, act as though you were him.  It discusses Kay as well; that will be the most difficult.  The men who tried to kill me tonight, will never leave the estate.
What was it, so I'll know.
I asked about Fredo?
And Kay...she's all right?
How did they get their hands on Pentangeli?
They are everywhere!
I know you do, Tom.  Then I can count on you to help me do the things I have to do.  If not, call Houstan, and become a Vice-President. Take your family and your mistress and move them to Las Vegas.
We've never sent this much with one courier.
Yeah, but don't worry.
Frankie, you were always interested in politics, in history.  I remember you talking about Hitler back in '43.  We were young then.
The Roman Empire... when a plot against the Emperor failed, the plotters were always given a chance to let their families keep their fortunes.
Don't worry about anything, Frankie Five-Angels.
No one can trace anything to me; I pride myself on that.
And what's the price of their not finding out.
Is he related to the witness?
Whose orders are these?
There are a lot of things I want to talk to you about.  Things I've been thinking about -- changes I want to make.
His brother came to help him.
On a plane back to Sicily.
You missed my point; you are no longer an owner.
Alright.  They bother me once in awhile.  Tell me, when Pop had troubles... did he ever think, even to himself, that he had gone the wrong way; that maybe by trying to be strong and trying to protect his family, that he could... that he could... lose it instead?
Sit down, this is almost over.  You follow the baseball games?
What a mistake; people behaving like that, with guns.  It was my understanding we left all that behind.  But, let me tell you, the important thing is that you're all right.  Good health is the most important thing; more than success; more than power; more than money.
We do favors for each other...
Nothing is more important.
Then you have to trace it.  Michael, people here look at me as a reliable man.  I can't afford not to be looked on as a reliable man.  But you know all that; there's nothing you can learn from me.  You shouldn't have to put up with a sick old man as a partner.
You're a careful kid, and that's good.  But look.  An international dispatch on the wire service. American journalism, not propaganda. The government troops have all but eliminated the rebels.  All but their radio station.
Terrible.  I'd give twice this amount to take a piss without it hurting.
Why...the Rosato Brothers.
Hiya, Mr. Corleone, I'm Sam Roth. Welcome to the Capri; my brother's upstairs.  You wanta take a rest before you see him, or can I get you something, anything at all?
This witness has testified that you are personally responsible for the murder of a New York Police Captain in the year 1947 and with him a man named Virgil Sollozzo.  Do you deny this?
Is it true that in the year 1950 you devised the murder of the heads of the Five Families in New York, to assume and consolidate your nefarious power?
Clemenza promised them nothing, he hated the sonsuvbitches.
And while I feed my family in New York, you put the knife in my back in Miami.
You give your loyalty to a Jew over your own blood.
I know.
Rosato, where's your brother?
Forget it; I'm suddenly without an appetite.  You're making big trouble, Carmine.
Don't I look like I'm listening?
Excuse me, I hope I am not a disturbance, Don Corleone.
Your good heart in helping the poor widow has shamed me, and I want to show that I, too, have some Christian charity.  Her rent will remain what it was.
I've gotten to know someone who's famous.
This old guy -- he's the kind of person I expected to meet when I moved out here.  Someone who's done things with his life.
You know, I just can't do that anymore.  I still have time to get things right.  Get married again --
The look on your face!  You're not marriage material.  You're not even boyfriend material.  You're a kid. A big, fun, slightly irresponsible kid.
I like my life.  I'm a free man.
Don't worry, you already paid me. I'm here because --
The Master is dressing.  I am to offer you a drink.  There is whiskey and there is iced tea.
Yeah?  What's your husband do?
Then you're as single as I am.
You're sure of that?
What is the good English?  All I know is bugger.  He is a bugger. Men who bugger each other.
You did not know?
Maybe.  But I still need to talk. Do I have time for a cup of coffee before I go?
And your name is --?
I couldn't help but notice your tattoo.  That phrase?  Death Before Dishonor.  What does it mean?
Getting to be a warm day.  A scorcher, as you Yanks call it.
Everything alright, Mr. Boone?
These are your paintings?
When they stay in your employ too long, servants begin to think they're married to you.  Please, Mr. Boone.  Help yourself.
You must excuse me for staring, Mr. Boone.  But you have a marvelous head.
You went to university?
That shirt, Mr. Boone.
We could wrap this like a toga around your shoulders.  Would that help you overcome your schoolgirl shyness?
I liked it.  We all did.
No.
I'll pay our going rate.  Plus what you'd get if you did the hedges.
Oh dear.  If one must have a clinical name.
I never thought you were.
So we understand each other?
I hope this has nothing to do with your refusing to sit for me today?
Same difference, Mr. Boone. Disgust, fear of the unknown -- all part of the great gulf that stands between us.  Am I right in assuming that you've had little experience with men of my persuasion?
Barnett.  Was that his name? Leonard Barnett.  He came to the front straight from Harrow.  And he looked up to me.  Unlike the others, he didn't care that I was a workingman impersonating his betters.  How strange, to be admired so blindly.  I suppose he loved me.  But chastely, like a schoolboy.
If you don't mind driving, I'd like to take you as my guest.  There should be lots of pretty starlets to keep you amused.
I suppose you'd like the top down.
Are you enjoying yourself?
Oh fuck.  And we left the top down. You want to run for it?
The morning after Pearl Harbor, he drove down to St. Louis to reenlist.  He was so damn excited. World War II was going to be his second chance.  They told him he was too old...fat ...nearsighted.  Said he'd be more use to his country if he stayed home and looked after his family.
That's from your movie, right? "The only monsters are here."
No.  It won't do.
I don't know.
Just take off the fucking mask!
When you die...be sure your brain is the last organ to fizzle --
I'm up.  Thanks.
You coming, Boone?
You're like a dog with a bone over this movie, Clay.
Where's Betty?
She tells me you haven't been sleeping well.
Then take the pills.
What are you doing here?
I would've thought Mr. Leslie Howard would be more your line.
I saw Una O'Conner a few weeks ago. She said you'd been under the weather.
Please.  You shouldn't stand on my account.
She is horrible.
Does the yardman come today?
Do you miss having someone to talk to, Hanna?
That is my daughter.  She say she and her husband are coming to town this afternoon.  I am sorry, Mr. Jimmy.  I will make it short.
This is the studio where I paint.
So, Mr. Kay?  What do you want to know?
Yes?
Am I correct in assuming, Mr. Kay, that it's not me you're interested in, only my horror pictures?
I am not dead yet, Mr. Kay.
That's funny, Mr. Whale.
Too warm for a sweater, anyway.
My idea.  Muchly.  My sketches. Big heavy brow.  Head flat on top so they could take out the old brain and put in the new, like tinned beef.
Oh my God.  What's wrong, Mr. Whale?  Is it your heart?
I was going to take a swim.
You, Mr. Kay?  How do you know George Cukor?
What are you doing here?
It's been a long time, Memphis --
He took a job. And he fumbled it. Now he's jammed-up. Jammed-up bad...
Don't feel the need to explore my family dynamics, Atley...
Fish.
You have a Hollandaise sauce ?
I think about that night a lot...
Jesus, man ... What'd you do?
It's about my brother ... Kip...
I can come up with the front money. Pay you back...
I'm not interested --
I'm just here about my brother.
Get out of here, Ray --
They just brought in Donny Astricky. Shot by a jacker ...
You'll leave -- ?
I remember us having made some kind of deal, Randall. I don't remember this deal having some kind of time-limit. I look at you - here - in my town - and I'm confused...
Or your baby brother. What was his name?
And this has what to do with me?
It's funny. There's probably been five more cars stolen in the time I've been here ...
Not my girl anymore
I know you.
What's wrong with it -- ?
When'd you get to town, Raines?
What for?
Where you been, anyway?
You seem a little hinked-up ...
Got it ...
Yeah.
So? Tell me: how come they call you "Freb" anyways -- ?
What color?
Most of 'em are late-model...
Jesus. The whole damn thing's loaded.
The corner of Hawthorne and Granvia. Tumbler messed up. He said the Lotus would be at the corner of Hawthorne and Granvia --
How you know that?
You look good...
oh.
Why didn't you tell me?
You getting my checks ... ?
Any more, O -- ?
Any more ...
No...
Hey, Kip ...
This has nothing to do with any of that --
Hey, you want something to eat ?
He's gonna kill you -- !
You can handle it?
What are you doing here?
Ain't we good-timing here ... ?
Dad'd be proud --
What era was that -- ?
Having fun, Kip?
Come here -
What are you doing here?
You boost her -- ?
You want me to buy her?
Thirteen down ... Thirty-seven to go ...
But don't worry, man. Things are all sweetness and light here...
You know of one -- ?
Call 911 -
You still wrenching at Bacchiochi's?
On account of Mitch?
Hey.
No whistles, but a Club You bring a hack -- ?
Gosh, no. Lipstick? What next? Mascara, blush, floral-print dresses?
So, you seeing anybody?
The alarms go off ...
I ratchet your ignition mechanism ...
Where to -- ?
What -- ?
I appreciate your dilemma, Memphis. But how are two washed-up thieves and an old man supposed to boost 50 cars in three days...
Okay. All our ladies should be home now, tucked in bed. Let's keep chilly. Think Slow. Any questions?
You're gonna be okay, Toby... You are ... We'll getcha fixed up...
But he was always a bad kid, that one.
Hey, look at him. Tommy. You grew up.
Hey, Billy. Watch the suit.
What did you hear about that thing?
I don't want any more of that Shit.
I'm not going to get fucked like Gribbs. He's seventy years old and the fucking guy is going to die in prison.  I don't need that. I don't care who it is. I'm warning everybody. Gribbs got twenty years just because he said hello to some fuck who was sneaking around selling junk behind his back. That's not going to happen to me.  You understand?
Here. Take it.  Now I gotta turn my back on you.
What're you doing? What about the car?
The bag with the envelopes.
I thought you were supposed to turn yourself in at ten o'clock this morning?
You son of a bitch. She's been here.
Stop! Stop!
Nobody's helping me. Tommy got four years. Marty and Fran are broke.  I asked your friend Remo for the money he owed you, and you know what he told me?
It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody.  Forget Paulie.  As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
Get packed.  We're getting out of here.
Jimmy's calling every day. It's urgent.
At least Jimmy and Mickey want to help. I talk to Mickey every day. That's more than I can say for the rest.
What are you talking about?
What about the schools?
we're gonna feed the bastard to the lions.
Give'm a drink.
Watch this.
I do it all the time. Bust their fucking balls.
It's that rat bastard from Pittsburgh. He ratted you all out. He's been a rat since he got busted in Pittsburgh.
I didn't agree to three points over the vig.- What am I nuts? I didn't need it that much.
And Jimmy's in it, right?
I You wasted eight fucking aprons on that guy. :
Do you realize what we're involved in here now?
You gotta help me. Okay? This girl I told you about? Diana? She's from the Five Towns. She's Jewish. She won't go out with me alone. Can you believe this shit? She's fucking prejudiced, but she's built. She's never been out with an Italian before. She says she'll only go out on a double date with her girlfriend.  You believe this shit? But you gotta see her. I mean, she's beautiful.
Driving you crazy?  Don't get me started.  You're here a month and sometimes I know he doesn't come home at all. What kind of people are these?
No way! You're kiddin'!
Keep fuckin' with me. Watch what happens.
She didn't do it again did she?
Jesus, that's really bad, did anyone even order a Flyin' Fish?
What do we got?
Thanks, Chuck.
You're kiddin' me.
Okay.
Oh...
See, now this doesn't feel right.  When I made the decision to come over here it felt right. I had all these rationalizations... I just don't understand why Will never tells me anything, he won't let me get close to him, he tells me these weird lies--
Would you shut the fuck up! I know what you ordered, I was there!
Come on, Will...
Chuck, let's go.
Hey, asshole. Happy Birthday.
Me and Bill scraped together the parts, worked on it. Morgan was out panhandlin' every day.
I'm not sure--
I don't think I...Larry?
Come on, that's what you do. You handle more than eighty percent of the intelligence workload. You're seven times the size of the C.I.A.
What is it?
Alexander, I know your theory. The boy is updating, he's strategy stealing...
No, there's a limit.
I'm trying to find the name of a student who works here.
Please, I'm a professor here and it's very important.
Yes. Under two conditions.
Okay. How?
That would be a monumental waste of time, wouldn't it, Will?
--that?--
Oh, for God's sake, Will.
--Maybe I don't want to spend my life sittin' around and explaining shit to people.
What are you smiling at?
Yes.
Excuse me, Professor Lambeau?
I know. We just couldn't wait 'till Monday to find out.
How about Gerald Lambeau? Ever heard of him?
Sean.
I got it.
Why would he do that?
That's great, Gerry, that there's interest-- But I'm not sure he's ready for that.
You see, Sean? That's exactly not the point. No one remembers that. They--
Sean, this is important. And it's above personal rivalry--
--And confuse him--
Now don't do that. Don't you do that! Don't infect him with the idea that it's okay to quit. That it's okay to be a failure, because it's not okay! If you're angry at me for being successful, for being what you could have been--
You're wrong, Sean. I'm where I am today because I was pushed. And because I learned to push myself!
Do you know when you'll be back?
Well, she out did herself today...
What happened?  You got fired, huh?
There goes that fuckin' Barney right now, with his fuckin' "skiin' trip." We should'a kicked that dude's ass.
So, you finally got a job Morgan?
You're right. I know.
I go places, I interact.
I might understand that.
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm married and I have two children.
Who is "Danny Terrio?"
"A History of the United States, Volume I." If you want to read a real history book, read Howard Zinn's "A People's History of the United States." That book will knock you on your ass.
Guy your age shouldn't smoke so much. Stunt your growth.
Yes, I do.
Free weights. WILL Oh yeah? Me too. What do you bench?
Yeah. Do you paint?
Maybe you should be a patient and sit down.
No.
Why thank you.
No.
You know, I was on this plane once. And I'm sittin' there and the captain comes on and is like "we'll be cruising at 35,000 feet," and does his thing, then he puts the mike down but forgets to turn it off. Then he says "man, all I want right now is a blow-job and a cup of coffee." So the stewardess goes runnin' up towards the cock-pit to tell him the mike's still on, and this guy in the back of the plane goes "don't forget the coffee!"
How'd it go?
Jesus Christ, you are an amateur.
Really? How'd the date go? WILL Do you still counsel veterans?  I read your book last night.
Is that why you didn't write anything else?
Well, I've read you colleagues. Your book was good, Sean.  All those guys were in your platoon?
When did you know she was the one?
Someone who challenges you in every way. Who takes you places, opens things up for you. A soul-mate.
But you can't give back to them, Will.
That's what I'm saying, Will. You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're afraid to take the first step because all you're seeing are the negative things that might happen ten miles down the road.
Nobody gets what they ask for, Will. That's a cop-out.
What?
Oh, I know.
Good for you. Congratulations.
Yeah?
Have you ever seen Annie Hall?
Didn't your mother ever tell you not to look a gift horse n the mouth?
You're not going into surgery tomorrow are you?
You men are shameful. If you're not thinking of your weiner then you're acting on its behalf.
Just for fun?
I want you to come with me.
"Take-back?" What is that? I don't want a take-back. I want you to come to California with me.
Look, Will if you're not in love with me, you can say that.
Well, what aren't you scared of? You live in your safe little world where nobody challenges you and you're scared shitless to do anything else--
I inherited that money when I was thirteen, when my father died.
Yes, Will. I didn't even know that?
I just wanted to call before you left.  I'm takin' all these job interviews. So I won't just be a construction worker.
Leave him alone, Ma--Al's just billy- goatin' around--
Maybe. Maybe twenny days work, maybe *no* days work. We ain't got it till we get it.
Well, you said anybody can waltz... How'm *I* doin'?
You bust outa jail, Tom?
Any gas?
Kinda pie y'got?
That's not your affair. Name.
How many men?
Kids?
Can all of you work?
House 25. Number's on the door.
Open up! We hear you got a riot.
I don't mean to be nosy, y'understand. I just got to have certain information. What's your name?
That's the way it is.
Government.
*Used* to be. Not no more. I lost the call.  But boy, I sure *used* to have it! I'd get an irrigation ditch so squirmin' full of repented sinners I pretty near *drowned* half of 'em!  But not no more. I lost the sperit.
At my meetin's I used to get the girls glory-shoutin' till they about passed out. Then, I'd go to comfort 'em--and always end up by lovin' 'em. I'd feel bad, an' pray, an' pray, but it didn't do no good. Next time, do it again. I figgered there just wasn't no hope for me.
But you wasn't a preacher. A girl was just a girl to you. But to me they was holy vessels. I was savin' their souls.  I ast myself--what *is* this call, the Holy Sperit? Maybe *that's* love. Why, I love everybody so much I'm fit to bust sometimes!  So maybe there ain't no sin an' there ain't no virtue. There's just what people do. Some things folks do is nice, and some ain't so nice. But that's as far as any man's got a right to say.
Been out travelin' around?
Maybe Ma'll have pork for supper. I ain't had pork but four times in four years--every Christmas.
This used to be mine. I give it to Grampa when I went away.  You reckon they could be dead?
This is Muley Graves.  You remember the preacher, don't you?
Lookie, Tom. We come to work here. They tell us it's gonna be fi' cents. But they was a whole lot of us, so the man says two an' a half cents. Well, a fella can't even eat on that, an' if he got kids...  So we says we won't take it. So they druv us off. Now they're payin' you five--but when they bust this strike ya think they'll pay five?
I guess that's right. Have to take a beatin' before he'll know.
Can't tell if you hear it or not. You hear it, Tom?
We ain't campin'. We jus' stoppin' a minute--
What's the matter? What's happened?
I don't like nobody drawin' a bead on me.
How about a lift, mister?
I seen your hands. You been swinging a pick or a sledge--that shines up your hands. I notice little things like that all the time.  Got a trade?
I didn't mean nothing.
You people got a lotta nerve.
Well, maybe. But I'd hate to be doin' it. Takes more nerve than I got.
Well, fi' cents a box ain't much, but a fella can eat.
What's he fixin' to do, ma?
I could break up some bresh if you want me, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
No, ma'am. They ain't no work hereabouts. Pa's in tryin' to sell some stuff to get gas so's we can get along.
But you can't *do* that, Grampa. This here land is goin' under the tractor. We *all* got to git out.
Now listen, Grampa. Listen to me, just a minute.
You know what I al'ays said: "Tom'll come bustin' outa that jail like a bull through a corral fence." Can't keep no Joad in jail!
What's the matter, Grampa?
Got any plants?
Sometimes I'm all jumpy inside.
I like the tent better.
Anybody ask anything?
How 'bout it?
You'll *what*?... Come on, Pa. Come on an' whup me. Jus' try it.
Make her easy, John. Watch her.
Mad, Ma?
Ma, you sick?
Didn' you get no sleep?
An' that's why you didn't want 'em to look?
That ain't the way they're tellin' it. They're sayin' you done it fust.
She's gettin' prettier, Ma.
I know you would, Ma. But I ain't gonna let you. You hide somebody that's kilt a man an'... an' you'd be in trouble too.
No, Ma. Not that. That ain't it. But long as I'm a outlaw, anyways, maybe I can do sump'n. Maybe I can jus' fin' out sump'n. Jus' scrounge aroun' an' try to fin' out what it is that's wrong, an then see if they ain't sump'n could be done about it.  But I ain't thought it out clear, Ma. I can't. I don't know enough.
Me neither.  It's jus' stuff I been thinkin' about. Gimme you han', Ma. Good-by. 
Oh, them? Well, no--them's *two* for a penny.
All you got to do is lay down an' watch.
Got that desert yet. Gotta take her tonight. Take her in the daytime fella says she'll cut your gizzard out.
Just in case. Sit up back an' if anybody tries to climb up--let 'im have it.
You wouldn't think jus' reachin' up an' pickin'd get you in the back.
Take 'er on down, Al. I'll sign.
Whatta you think you're talkin' about? I got a han'bill here says good wages, an' I seen it in the papers they need pickers!
But what about this?
Heh'o Tom.  This is Connie, my husband.
Tom says if it's day it'll cut you gizzard smack out a you.  I seen a pitcher once. They was bones ever'place.
I never knowed it! All I done was pull that string!
Please don't.
What's this?
Lotta these little farmers mighty nice fellas. Trouble is they're little, they ain't got much say-so.
You sure you got ever'thing ready?
Yes, sir.
What do you do?
Bob. Bob Destephano.
Remember high school?
Never better.
Ahhh... it's all fucked up. Nothing adds up to nothing... you work your whole life, day in and day out-- try to make sense of it all. One day you're twenty-seven and what do you get to show for it...
I want to be an actor.
Basically the same thing. In a very evolved, esoteric way.
Well, I gotta go. But I'll come back.
More like what happened? What happened, Mr. Blank?
Ohhh. You're in therapy too, Marty?
Are you going to the reunion?
It's always the little things.
I figured I could pick you up tomorrow around seven o'clock.
Yes.
Flowers. That's funny.
You look beautiful.
Seriously, when I left, I joined the Army and took the service exam. They found my psych results fit a certain profile. A certain "Moral flexibility" would be the best way to describe it... I was loaned out to a CIA- sponsored program. It's called "mechanical operations." We sort of found each other...
You kill people. 
Why don't you want to go to your high school reunion?
You went to school with these people.
Yes.
And how have you been feeling about your... work lately?
It's a free-market evolution. You'll wake up to it... c'mon Kid. We used to run together when you were a rookie. I don't want to run against you. This thing's real. Everybody's in.
But since we're both here, I think it's time to take a fresh look at our relationship.
No deal.
There you go. I left it blank.
Sometimes. I'm in divorce, mainly. Some property. Some personal injury.
Throw that away.
Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail.
And not show it to me. Ever again.
They blame you for the compromise.
And sir, I also get that broken- mirror, black-cat, Friday-the- thirteenth kind of feeling about this one....
I have scruples. Next.
What's it look like?
Take care of her. She's a keeper.
And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro on foreign exchange?
So what happened to you?
How could you put your hard-earned dollars into the hands of the class bully?
I took the other road. I'm more of a self-reflective young lion who does business with lead-pipe cruelty and goes home to drink light beer in milky-eyes isolation. I love sports and sex and have no real relationships with anyone. And you?
Well, if you could just come for the day. New York's only a few hours by plane, I'd have you home by dinner...
Look, I'll talk to Grace and call you later--
What?
Well... It's beautiful country, I'll give you that. And I could see having some kind of vacation place. Retreat. But I don't know how you do it full time. Don't you miss the rest of the world?
I don't jog, Mr. Booker. I run.
I found this old cello case filled with bills and receipts.
Are you shy, Mr. Booker?
Poor thing.
Son?
You missed a button.
This is Mr. Booker, Robert.
Oh, God, what are we going to do? I'm supposed to --
Show me again.
No, you didn't.
Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down...
Fine!
I don't believe this!
I thought there were too many forks on the table.
Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork.
Honey, nobody's trying to cure you --
Look, I just wanted to say, I think it's great you're riding again. And... and I think I know why you, you needed to do it alone... without anyone knowing...
Started what?
Who is it?
Great!
Well, I suppose we could use another good public feud...
Okay. You want me to pick you up?
"... FRESH, WIND IN HER HAIR... LIFE WITHOUT CARE... SHE'S BROKE... BUT IT'S 'OK'...
I don't understand. You just said he said no.
I come home and you tell me we're going to drive a psychotic horse to Montana! I can't just pick up and leave...
I really wish I could understand why you think this is so necessary.
I miss you, Annie.
I thought you guys were going to call me.
Huh-huh. You?
Small bed. Maybe I should sleep in the barn.
How are you feeling about work?
Are you going to stay in the city or go up to Connecticut?
Probably first thing in the morning. It's too late to start now. I'm going to try not to do too much driving in the dark.
I'll tell you something, Annie -- I stood there looking at what was happening to that horse... And, I swear, it felt like the same thing was happening to me.
No. I am a "tubab."
Where to?
Well, did you ever think about hiring a business manager?
It's so cruel.
What choice!!?
How's Peterson's holding up for you?
Mm-mm. I never knew him. He died before Frank and I met. This here's...  Frank and Tom's mother and father... there's little Frank and Tom...
You don't seem to upset?
Frank's a good man.
I don't think anybody can make Tom do anything he didn't want.
I think I'm going to have my hands full with the son of mine when you leave. Just might be his first broken heart.
Annie, it's Liz. How's Grace?
Maybe we should give him another sedative.
... well, I just think she's got a lot of nerve showing up here. Draggin' that child and that poor animal all the way...  You eat with those fingers again and you know what'll happen!  Frank, don't you think she's got a nerve?
They're already all settled in, Frank. Anyway, I'm sure Annie wants her privacy.
I have some brownies left over. Want one?
He says if you do it soon as they're born, it makes them real easy to handle later on.
Teacher asked me why we raise Black Angus-Herefords 'stead of Pure Herefords.
I don't believe it.
Well, I'd like to welcome Annie and Grace to their first branding...
You wouldn't want to dance with me, would you?
Isn't it like, obvious?
I can't...
Just follow this. Nothing to it. I'm going to shut my eyes here for a little while. Just keep going till you run out of road.
It's warmer than I thought.
You want to go down or stay along the river?
Jude, you okay?
Honey, you all right? Did something fall?
What, sweetheart?
IT WAS MY TURN!
Hi. It's a pleasure. I'm very grateful for the way you took in my girls here. I bet you were surprised when they just showed up out of nowhere.
If it's not too much trouble, I thought I might.
In English, please. I didn't spend ten years protecting the president so I could finish my career feeling like an idiot.
As you can see, this is just a simple microcassette recorder.   Hook it up to the phone and drop in five bucks in quarters.
So what do you think, can I crash at your place tonight?
Snoop onto them...
What are you, stoned or stupid? You don't hack a bank across state lines from your house, you'll get nailed by the FBI. Where are your brains, in your ass? Don't you know anything?
Oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack, you score one of those Gibsons man. You know, supercomputers they use to like, do physics, and look for oil and stuff?
His parents missed Woodstock and he's been making up for it since. Hey, you hear about Joey's bust?
Oh wow, we are fried.
Dead.
Due to Mr. Gill's untimely demise and everything, I guess you two will have to improvise the next round.
Dade?
You haven't been doing anything stupid, right, Dade?  Right, Dade?!
The girl. The girl has the disc I need.
Two days.
What the hell is going on?
It's too much machine for you.
Yeah.
Make it our first date.
This is every financial transaction Ellingson conducts, yeah? From million dollar deals to the ten bucks some guy pays for gas.
Joey got cut off before he got to that part. Check it out. By this point, it's already running at, what, twice the speed as when it started.
Shit!!
Excuse me.
Yeah, I'm sorry, I was just looking for the principal's office.
Gill.
It got you seven years probation. No computer, couldn't even use a touch tone phone.
You're welcome.
There's a new virus in the database.
Uh, Mr. The Plague, uh, something weird's happening on the net.
Alright. How about the Master of Disaster, huh?
Joey, a garbage file holds miscellaneous data. Junk. Bits of stuff that's been erased, man.
Any questions?
Yesterday, the ballast program for a supertanker training model mistakenly thought the vessel was empty, and flooded its tanks.
So what are we supposed to do?
What?
Murphy kid turn you down?
Thank you.
You're late.
Well you found out this morning? Why didn't you tell me before? I mean it's 5 o'clock now Rachel...shit
So?
I mean, you blew off our date at last minute.
I am different, it's just that I just got pissed off...that's all.
What's going on?
Who's that?
Is there another key?
Brady!
When did this happen?
I've seen bodies thrown 50-60 feet from a crash site.
How do we look?
Honey, I don't think their home.
Because the lights are all out.
We should call the fire department.
Why wasn't I notified?
You know damn well about what.  You let them take it out of here.
Why shouldn't I?
Four plus Myers.
Has he been prepped?
Not like 'ol Ben Meeker do something like that.
We're going to Ben's. The phone never just rings at a police station.
Like the last time? How many people killed back then? How many kids?
It's been eleven months.
Hi.
I wanna go trick-or-treating like the other kids.
Come on Rachel.
Jamie!
I'm gonna lower you to the chimney, okay Jamie?
Rachel!
We'll hear sirens soon.
I didn't know you and Brady had anything okay?
You remember Lindsay don't you?
You won't look pushy.
Hell of a night.
Leave Myers for the state boys.
Do you?
You look sharp. You understand?
132 to 133 this is 134.
Go to my house. We'll call the state force from there.
You got your riot gun?
Loomis. Folks around here aren't likely to forget your face. At least not cops. So what brings you back here after 10 years?
Its true, Sheriff.
Something?
Oh Christ. Doc...
Oh Christ. They wouldn't have given up without a fight.
How can a man do this Loomis? Tell me.
How far are you going, Mr. Sayer?
What are you hunting, Mr. Sayer?
Hi, Annie, Laurie...
Someone broke into the hardware store. Probably kids.
Why didn't you wait for me?
Saving the treats for Bob?
I'M baby sitting for the Doyles. It's only three houses away. We can keep each other company.
Well, home sweet home. I'll see you later.
Why didn't you say anything? You scared me to death.
I've already lost it.
I hate that dog. I'm the only person in the world he doesn't like.
You'll have to. He's calling you tomorrow to find out what time to pick you up.
Fancy.
I'm glad you're here because I have something I want you to do. I want you to call up Ben Tramer and tell him you were just fooling around.
Annie, Paul's on the phone!
I don't want to.
You idiot!
Anybody live here?
Come on... A skunk could have killed it...
You have the wrong feeling.
Where?
Isn't that David Graham? He's cute.
Are you coming over tonight?
Can we watch the monster movies?
'Neutron Man'... 'Laser Man'... I can see why. 'Tarantula Man'...
Laurie...
What about the rest of my comic books?
What about the bogyman?
Promise?
Tommy, stop it! You're scaring Lindsey.
Be quiet! Get Lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door!
Now I want you to change your clothes, Tommy. We're going to take a walk outside.
Hello.
Yes, she is.
The driveway's a few hundred yards up on your right.
I see.
I couldn't if I tried.
What did he say?
I love that.  That's my type.
And the quail is responsible for the quail eggs.
Hi.
You know, April, people pass by vital structures in this city all the time, and they never take the time to appreciate them.  I get the feeling you tune in to your environment.
What are your favorite buildings, David?
Hannah will invite some men over who don't look like Ichabod Crane.
We're a big hit.
Uh-- APRIL  I-i-it has an o-organic quality, you know.
It's French, though.  It really is.
Well...we have seen a lot of stuff today, though.
Oh, geez, yeah.
Well, sometimes, some, uh...
Yeah, we have Mr. Morris Levine's eightieth birthday party on Riverside Drive...or Riverside Memorial Chapel, depending on his health.
Here, I stole you a couple of extra clams.
It's really sad.
Well, I-I guess if you live in Chelsea, that's probably first.
So what's the, uh, problem this time?
Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family.  I mean, he's, you know, he's--
And it's just in one ear?
Now, don't get alarmed.  These are just more sophisticated audiometry tests than I can run here.  I mean, it's, it's nothing.
Hi, Dusty.
Yeah.  Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big.
Oh, yes!  You live near here, don't you?
Isn't this great?  They have everything here.
No, no.  I-I-I understand completely. No problem.  Y-you're busy.  I-I-I...
Yes.
Well, thanks a lot.
Page a hundred and twelve.
Oh, you-you have that one?
Isn't that beautiful?
Uh...did you ever get around to e.e. cummings?
Oh!
Oh, no, no, no.  It, uh, it-it-it- it was i-inevitable that Hannah and I part, anyway.
But-but, but how about you?  Do you, do you share any of my feelings? Or is this just an unpleasant embarrassment to you?
That was just perfect.  You've ruined me for anyone else.
I was so worried I wouldn't compare with Hannah.
Lee...
They're fantastic.
Your sister is an unbelievable cook.
You bet.
It's so late.
Why not?
I want one with you.
Oh, let's not--I, I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
I don't understand.  I thought that you would be happy.
Well, because I never thought of God in my life.  Now I'm giving it serious thought.
I'll either be unconscious or I won't.  If not, I'll deal with it then.  I'm not gonna worry now about what's gonna be when I'm unconscious.
Well, there was a time  when you were very happy to be only with me.  You wanted to learn everything about poetry, about music.
Elliot lusts after you.
What are you going to use for money?!
Oh, yes, you have!
You've been with someone!
So you met somebody else?
Oh, God, I don't even know what I want.
Mickey, Mickey, listen, listen.
Mickey, come on, we got a show to do!
Yes!
Aah... Hey, have you tried Holly and her friend's shrimp puffs?
Oh, I don-- Ask Elliot for that. Uh, he's got them somewhere.
I hope you tell her it was your idea...
...'cause every time I try to be helpful, you know, sh-she gets so defensive.
Do you miss Frederick?
Oh, he's fine.  He's-he's, I guess he's fine.  I don't know.  He's been kinda moody lately, the last few months.
Yeah.  I-I don't know what's wrong with him.  He's just...kind of distant and difficult.
Hi!  Hi!
I gotta see new comedians later, I've gotta--
Yeah?
I like him.  I think he's a sweet guy.
That's really nice!
Come on!  Hurry up!  Let's go!
How could I ruin myself?  What do you mean, ruin myself?
I want to experience childbirth.
Hannah and I...can't have any children.  Now I-I-I don't want to get into whose fault it--  It's my fault that we can't and- and-and the details are too embarrassing to--
Here, Mom.  Drink this.  You know, you're awful.  You probably were flirting.
You promised to stay on the wagon.
You admit that we're great cooks, right?
Maybe when she's eighty, she'll stop straightening her garter belt when there's a guy around.
Watch out, you guys.  Beep-beep!
Oh, Hannah!
Not this Thanksgiving, you know.
Ouch!
...and then she just breaks down.  And he has this sweet daughter...and when she goes to college next year, he's going to split permanently.  I mean...
Yeah, can you believe it?
Well, you think everybody in m- musicals sings so well?
Boy, you really know how to cut me down.
Awwww...
Well, I don't know.  We'd uh, uh, um... Didn't Mom mention there was something...something at the Museum of Broadcasting?
Hey, what's the matter?
Wow, I guess I hit a nerve.
That's the point.  I'd like to be bothered.
Can we, can we go?
Can I take you someplace to hear something nice?
Oh, look, I'm sorry it didn't work out.
God!
Mmm, I don't know if you remember me, but we had the worst night of my life together.
I was walking past and I saw you in here...
Good.  How are you?
Yeah, really.  You do.  You do.
It was a terrible evening.
I'd never do that.
People change...you know.
Are you, are you out of work or something?
Oh, it just came to me one day.
Oh, God!
Gosh, you really went through a crisis, you know that?  H-how did you get over it?  I mean, when I ran into you, you seemed, you seemed just perfectly fine.  Well, you seem fine now.
Now don't get nervous.  It's just your husband.
Hi.  How you doin'?
Yeah, well, she and an architect are now a very definite item, which I still cannot believe.
Oh, please!  We all came to have lunch, didn't we?
Aren't you glad to see me?
Would you mind saying that into your bag...?
To <u>show</u>...  in my ability to <u>squander</u>.  What one might deem an <u>advantage</u>... that my <u>strength</u> is greater than <u>yours</u>...
Well.  Word gets around.
...how are things at the Hospital?
...you...
There's one or two freaks, and, for a "<u>Pass</u>," I'll rat them out to you... 
...aren't you afraid of me...?
No, you're wrong about Verger.
I feel...  I feel they're Out to <u>Get</u> Me...
How you doin?
What, What, I can't hear you...
What else did I miss...?
...are they hard to get?
The identity of the person offering the bounty was never established.
<u>Do</u> it...
Where was the call from.
If you would see him monument, look around you.
..It won't be long now, sir...
You give me whatever I want...?
...and then, he'll be coming down.
Oh, yes, what?  You'd <u>bribe</u> me, to, to, to, "release" you...?
...unmarked hundreds....
I could have acted on my own.  I was told...
Look at this:
Not for our Doctor Lechter.  This...  Purports to be an x-ray of the hand of a ...white male...mmmm....mmmm...., after the removal of a vestigial sixth digit. Left Hand.  It purports to be the x-ray of Dr. L...
I know you did what you could.
I think that's... {HE STARTS TO RISE, AND THE MEETING BEGINS TO BREAK UP) Starling, I'm sure these gentlemen...
Because that's understandable, because. She blew the raid.
I'm an orphan.
You know it?
I never met him.  I knew him only from his writings.
I'm a historian.  It is our task to assemble the seemingly unconnected into the obvious.
My scar is a war-wound.
Yes.  How did you know?
How could you know?
You know America?
Dr. Fell is studying for his examination by the Studiolo.
Darling...
Who does not?
In and out.  Yes.  And Mama... and Mama, is not your real Mama, is she Franklin?
She's not the first foster that you've had.  <u>Is</u> she?
Yes.... yes...
Make them eat the figurine.
Well, I don't want to starve them too long.  They die.
I'm saying: ... and what's wrong with that.
And, fine, alright, and fine... what are <u>you</u>doing, this whole time?
...I'm sorry....?
Indeed we were.
Freud, do you know...?  Freud psychoanalyzed patients in One Afternoon.
...which of us is free...?
...might I make a suggestion...?
...when I... 
Our Mister <u>Frendler</u> to, to, to humiliate me, though....
Because, baby, you're looking to find love in an institution, that's your only chance....
I don't wanna go out there at <u>all</u>...
No.
What would you guess, Ardelia?
Don't shoot yourself.
...the purpose of the exercise... is it because they are <u>expensive</u>...
"Because we don't have any money."
Ask me when we get home.
...and then, we're going to <u>Greece</u>...
Thank you.
...this one is my favorite.  It has not title.  They should call it "fetch," whaddaya think...?
Speaking of the Vacant Post.
...I feel that...
..and <u>humiliation</u>?  What is this new job they've...?
If <u>he</u> could overcome... his need for... for self-<u>ratification</u>...
I told that woman I'm an orphan.
Yes, but no one is in control of their emotions.  that's all we have time for today... 
...yes...?
Your life has been defined by institutions.  The Orphanage where you were raised, the FBI Academy, the Bureau.  If the Institution is your life, <u>accept</u> it.  Ask to be reinstated on the "Drumgo" task force.  Play their game.
And all he <u>left</u> us:  the Country brought back his <u>hat</u>, and his <u>badge</u>... both with a bullethole in them.  An' that's what he left us.  That's what I said.
Ah, yes, ah yes.  Our Doctor Lechter... And have they sent you, once again to <u>capture</u> him?  How terrible for you...
...sir...?
Believe me, I wish I knew less.  Oh, if you weren't such a pig...
But, but that was before we started sharing stuff. Before I told you how I cried when Peepers died. I never told anyone that before.
You think you're so...but you're just...
No.
Yowza--Only a virgin could answer that fast.
Do you realize if the women of America would have just heard what you said...
Talia, don't go!
Freeze!  You're busted!
Thanks, Talia...Why are you so nice to me?
Am-ber!  Uh...don't do that.
One day they'll find a cure for AIDS. They'll never find one for sex. It's kind of funny, most movies and stories with a bunch of camp counselors has some serial psycho in the woods with a chainsaw who systematically butchers everybody one by one.
Yeah. I guess I do.
She got a little poison oak and started screaming for assisted suicide.
Sorry Veronica.
Don't say that.
I don't believe it. I'm winning.
I missed you. I know I'm not as, as exciting as your other friends.
Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I smoke these damn things?
Hey Veronica, how'd that Teenage Prevention T.V. Suicide thing go?
Let me get it clear, Veronica. You want yourself a sweet homeboy for this T.V. show so you can show everybody what a loose, Martin Luther Cosby-lovng place Westerburg is.
Sawyer. Guess what today is?
Hey, this question wouldn't be that bizarro thing you were babbling about over the phone last......
If you're going to openly be a bitch....
Crap. So who's this Brad guy I've been set up with? Witty and urbane pre-lawyer or albino accountant?
You were nothing before you met me! You were playing Barbies with Betty Finn! You were a Brownie, you were a Bluebird, you were a Girl Scout Cookie! I got you into a Remington Party! What's my thanks? It's on the hallway carpet. I get paid in puke!
What do you want from me?
Yeah, she really wants to talk to you.
Veronica! Color me stoked, girl. I've gotten <u>everyone</u> to sign this petition even the one who think BigFun are tuneless Eurofags. People love me!  My God, you haven't signed!
No way, no day!
Let's knock off early. Go to the mall. Something lame like that.
Everybody's life's got static. Is your life perfect?
Killing her won't solve anything.
Good plan.
No luck? Well, milk and orange juice'll do quite nicely. Quite nicely.
What are we going to tell the cops? "Fuck it if she can't take a joke, Sarge."
I'm just a little freaked, all right?  You got what you wanted, you know.
Did you miss him completely?
We killed them, didn't we?
Did to.
Football season's over, Veronica. Kurt and Ram had nothing to offer the school but date-rapes and A.I.D.S. jokes.
It's over, J.D.  Over!
Look at that. Eskimo. One word. I love it. I usually go for whole sentences myself, but hey this is perfecto. Eskimo. So mysterious...
Answer him dick!
That pudwapper just stepped on my foot.
Hey kid, isn't the prom coming up?
We have to talk.  Whether to kill yourself is one of the most important decisions a teenager has to make.
This story of yours-maybe the school newspaper will print it when it's finished.
Let's have 'em now, while they're fresh, eh, Nora?
No arguments there, Dr. Hulme! All that time inside working on those novels of theirs. They don't get fresh air or exercise!
Juliet's infectious . . . she'll be going to hospital.
I had a nasty foreboding feeling at first, but now I realise my crime was too frightful for an ordinary lecture.
My God, what a disgrace you are! You shame me, you shame the family. You're nothing but a cheap little tart!
Who cares!
snatches up an exercise book from a large pile.
I wouldn't want my private business being discussed with a complete stranger!
It's best not to get too close. Juliet's still not a hundred percent. Hello, Juliet! We've bought you some fruit.
looks startled at the outburst.
Oh-what a nice outfit!
is bending down, pulling a tray of sausage rolls into the oven. Both girls look at HONORA silently.
This.
That.
I'm sure they'll notice things missing.
But that's not true! I've got one.
I thought for hours about whether Carmelita should accept Bernard's marriage proposal . . .
Isn't it beautiful!
What just happened to me anyway? It looked like a dream but it felt like reality.
Where's Kirsty? Where's my wife?
These hallucinations I'm having. I think they're more like memories coming back to me in a strange way.
Hint. It's not a geographical location.
Sure plenty of times.
Trevor if someone is talking from a sleep state they are obviously dreaming. So practically everything say is going to sound strange.
I understand... I won't-
Allison I think I did some very, very bad things. I mean very bad.
Since what?
Yeah? You and who else?
Have we met?
Our little toy. You usually have it up and running by now.
What isn't wrong? Why are you doing this anyway?
Never to put you in my will.
Happy Anniversary, Mrs. Gooding.
It should all in the report. I told you guys everything. She was giving birth in the fucking car. She grabbed the wheel and I lost control.
The whackjob in the black lipstick who lives down the hall? She wanted you arrested for harassment. I told her to chill out and smoke a joint. I'd look the other way as long as she did you know?
Look Larry I know you never thought too much of me. And I know this all sounds a little fucked up.
What happens if I'm convicted of Kirsty's murder?
Please Larry. Pretend you like me and humor me.
I don't know what I'm doing here. I'm not even Catholic. I just had to tell somebody. It's like, ever since my wife died I don't know what I've actually done or what I've imagined. But I do know if one tenth of what's happening to me is reality... I've done some really awful things in my life. Things that I've... I guess I've blocked out...
It was an analogy. Your soul is locked up inside you. You need to free it Trevor. You've blocked it from the healing process. That's what we need to do now. Heal your soul. And to do that I you have to give in utterly and without any hesitation or doubt. Do you know what I mean by giving in? It's about trust. Do you trust me implicitly?
Hey. Can I borrow something?
Wow. That's good. Lots of capers, huh?
Whoa, I have serious space issues, dude. What do you want?
You got a drinking problem or what?
That's for Ga... Ms. Gayley.
That's close enough.  It's a confession.  The truth.  Jesus, I'm sorry, LaPlante.  I had the shoe, you said you didn't want, publicity because of your legal problems.
The bathroom!  For two days?
You stole her purse!  While you were saving her?
Which don't sound like such a bad goddamn idea, John.
I'm not saying I hate sick people or anything but I hate being <u>around</u> them if you know what I mean.  There <u>you</u> go, you <u>inspire</u> this kid to <u>live</u>.  I probably woulda vomited on him.
What's going on?  "Guilty"!  What is this?
A son, yeah.  What about him?  Joey.
Uh, his birthday, uh, May.  I think.
She don't like me to see him. Says I'm a bad influence.
Mister LaPlante, I really want to help you, but crazy stories are only going to make it worse.  The D.A. is asking your bail be set at twenty-five thousand dollars because you were arrested again while you were out on bail...
Whaddaya mean they didn't reduce the bail?  If they didn't reduce it, how'dja spring me?
You whaaaaaat?  You paid it?  You gave a bondsman ten percent?
Listen, now that I owe you twenty-five hundred bucks plus, how about loaning me twenty for cab fare?
Hey!  Do I have a record?  Have I ever done time?  I mean I been arrested a few times, who hasn't? Parking tickets for Chrissake! Suspicion of stuff!  Have I ever been convicted of anything?
You gotta kid?  How old's your kid?
I didn't even know you had a kid.
Hey, I don't blame you for bein' sore.  I know I screwed up gettin' busted in here.  You got a right to throw me out.
What wouldja say if I toldja I ran into a burning plane an' saved a buncha people, Chick, an' risked my goddamnlife?
Yeah, like that.  Same thing.
Nothin'.
He had an emergency call... a <u>real</u> emergency.
That's what I'm trying to... to... okay, nevermind.  Just lemme talk to Joey to... to apologize.
I was giving him some advice is all. Preparing him for life.  You don't want him to grow up soft, Ev	, it's tough out there, it's a goddamn jungle.
Turn that thing off.
What, is everybody in love with this, bozo?  I don't get this.  What about...?
Underbelly!
Listen, Mister LaPlante... uh, Bernie... Who... are... you?
Here.  Get off here.
I... no... I don't have the right... I...
We're gonna wait here?  The guy could be hours.
This guy LaPlante won an award?
He's gotta be a nut!  He saves all those people and swipes a <u>purse</u>?
Not bad.  But if you gotta wear a cast, you oughtta feature it more it's parta the story.  Network's taking everything we give 'em.  They wanta feed off our six o'clock whether we find the mystery guy or not.  We're very big nationally.
We're gonna feature Gale's cast more.  The trick is gonna be keeping the upper hand on this piece. As long as we have Gale and there's no mystery guy, we're the center of the story.  But if he shows up and somebody else gets him first or exclusive...
Does this mean I can stop worrying? Where'd we put him?
The Presidency.  The public loves him.
He lost a shoe!
Oh my God!  Bernie!
I didn't say I thought we should have saved him..
"This is Gale Gayley for Channel Four News!"  Incredible. Unbelievable!  For Bernie LaPlante! He's a celebrity now?  'Cause he stole <u>paint</u>?
Hey, Miss Gayley, there's a cop looking for you.  From Robbery Detail, Inspector Dayton.  He wants you to call him.
Was that your dad?
So where are all your toys?
Where are these toys of yours?
Are you being helped, sir?
Any particular brand?
As long as you keep remembering why.
On the contrary -- this is tremendous.  I mean, we're all frightened to death of disapproval and we're constantly hiding behind these layers we manufacture for ourselves -- and I'm not saying we should, you know, <u>declare</u> ourselves unhesitatingly to our fellow human beings in the interests of total openness and honesty --
I bet.  Going into people's homes.
Have you just plain asked him?
Rita, he's only twelve years old,
C'mon, kids, let's go.
He doesn't have a temperature.
Thank God.
Where'd he go?
Do you want me to come up and tuck you in?
This -- is -- the -- one -- for -- us.
But it's what we want.
And it's a shorter commute.
What if someone else buys it in the meantime?
How were we -- were we cool?
Did you hear what he said?
I know.  It's just having to pass muster with these juniors before the senior partner even agrees to see me.
Well, did he hear anything about your prospects for the new job?
Neil's still having a bad time at school.  I feel terrible seeing him so upset all the time.
Sweetheart, this is a very risky time for me right now.  Maybe you don't appreciate that.
Honey, I can't track of all the meals Charlie and I have been having.  This is a delicate time. If it leaks out that I'm jumping ship before I'm set up someplace else I could be out on my ear before I'm ready with nothing. With <u>nothing</u>.
Who told you that -- someone on the radio?
I don't know -- put 'em in the drawer with all the Chinese take- away menus.
Did the cleaning woman come?
Honey?  How did it go?  You didn't call me.
I was having a bad day -- I lost that job, I was dependent on other people, I was let down --
I think it's time I came home now.
It's been on the market a while, hasn't it?
Let's follow 'em.
Shit!
Are we gonna buy this house?
If you want that baseball jacket for your birthday, Neil, learn to cough a little more realistically.
I thought I was supposed to stay in my room.
Hey, I don't have answers for this. I just brought you down here because of the sword.
You didn't see this.  Understand?
Did you find a sword?  An old sword?
Hey Lieutenant, the boys in robbery have something I think you should look at.
This ties in with Nash.
What?
Doesn't it scare you walk through the park at night?
Where have you been for the last seven years?
No.  I'm telling you right now, the next person's head that comes off is gonna be yours.
Good evening, Lieutenant.
You'll have no need for that, Highlander.
I know that weapon.  It belonged to Juan Romeriz.  He's dead?
The prize?  So much blood so that in the end the one that remains will be mortal again.  So much pain so that the winner can grow old and have children.  The prize hardly seems worth the cost of it.
You cannot run from your destiny, Conner.
Must you do that?
Can't you enjoy it quietly?
For being a friend when I needed one. I hope our paths cross again.
What are we doing here?
Yes.
You've been seeing her for over a month now.  Have you learned nothing from the past?
I'll go first.
You can go first.
I think my Sarah fancies you, Conner.
We had a bargain.  You promised.
I cannot stay.
Leaving?  For how long?
Do you love me, Conner?
My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I was at the police station earlier today--
To talk to you.
Bullet proof vests don't bleed.
If it's good advice.
Where did you get it?
You're hurt.
Why?
On the back it has--
It came from your great, great, great grandmother, Isabelle Tourez, who lived in Paris and died on the guillotine in 1789 -- alone -- and unmarried.  The ring was given to her by someone who loved her -- but knew that it could never be.
Where will you go now?
We're holding the workers down below.
Someone broke into the cavern last night.
He's fine.  He swears he never left his post for a moment.  He heard a noise and when he went back to look they were already inside.
Incredible.  The cloth -- the buttons -- it looks to be mid sixteen hundreds.  It's a remarkable duplication.
Impressive -- is it not?  The problem is I can only keep the illusion for a few minutes.  I need more power to hold the form longer.  I need the Highlander.  Where is he?
It was not by choice.  A small matter of a mountain falling down on us.  We were trapped inside.  When the time of the Gathering came the urge to go was so strong we tried to claw through rock with our bare hands.  What you thought was the end -- was not.  This is the end.  We are the last of our kind, Macleod.
Would you care for some water, Conner?
Aye -- I know, Las -- and I have never loved anyone more.
You kept it?
What will you do?
I don't know.  He is the stronger one.  He has a power--
Did they?  You are only a man, different than most -- but still a man.  You feel the same -- want the same.  You want to live.
This check is for sixteen thousand dollars.  That's a lot of cash to be carrying around.
Wow.  Sure, right away, Chief.
I will, Chief.  Absolutely.
What'd you find out?
I hate that Mickey Mouse bastard.  I hated his father, and I hate Sonny, too. Always with the tan.
<u>Get on the floor</u>!
Not if they don't catch us, Kevin.
That's why we gotta keep going.  I'm not gonna go in for murder.
I have to tell you something --
Jesus.  What is this?
You with the cops?
Fuck you.  I'm running this shit.  You talk to me.
I'd be trying to get the best deal that I could.
<u>Look</u> at him!  I think he's dying!
The cops are comin'!
Donuts here any good?
<u>I don't know</u>.  Talley talked those punks into letting Smith out.  He's fucking us over, Glen.  That guy is fucking us over.
What do you want?
All right.  Now the second one.
I'll kill you!  You won't get the other disk!
Can we talk some more when you get here?
I should've called.  This thing broke right after we spoke, then everything happened so fast --
I'm scared shitless.
Want one?
What?
Kevin left without you.
Thanks for the shirt.
How can we get out?
What's going on?
That's enough.
Where are they?
That's not enough.
One at a time!  Clear the air!  Louise?  Talk to me.  What do we have?
I pulled Mickey and Dreyer off the minimart.
Excuse me?  <u>You</u> requested our help.  You turned over command --
I'm not stupid!  You can't get out of here fast enough, then you take back command; you agree to wait on Smith, then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him out --
Let it go, Captain.
It's right in front of us.
Mickey?  Call the state Homicide Bureau. Don't touch anything, just sit back and wait.
Okay, here's mine.  My name is Special Agent Jones.
In a few minutes the white phone is going to ring.  So let's get our shit straight before that happens.
What's my name?
What are you people going to do?
Slow down, Thomas.  Take it easy and talk to me.  Was your father shot?
How about you and your sister?
I think so.
He has lots of disks.
Can you open them?
That would be Glen Howell.  He was on his way for the disks.
Who are you?
What happened?
No, Bik, it's a code word for Tutsis.
Also, could you remember to use the service entrance at all times?
Paul...  ...I have to talk to you.
You work at the Hotel Diplomat?
Captain, I must take my family. It is not safe here.
Please, I don't use guns.
You will run into the hotel and hide behind the U.N.
Hold the line here. Do not shoot! The Colonel stabilizes the situation, his men watch the militia drive by. Paul approaches Oliver
Congratulations, Colonel. You have saved us all.
I ran out of bribes. Bizimungu took them away.
Yes, General. I am glad you came by. I overheard something that I think you should know about.
A discussion between an American Embassy official and a UN Colonel.
If I were to spare a few policemen, where would I station them?
I am strong, Paul, like a lion.
We must go to the Diplomat.
You are a marked man.
I will try my best George but these days I have no time for rallies or politics.
A bargain buy, from China. Ten cents each, I'll get a dollar.
For fuck's sake, Gloria There's a big news story out there! We need to get out and cover it.
You fucking see that!
Mr. Manager.
Paul, how the hell are ya'?
Anderson, Arthurs, Boulier. What is this?
Are you trying to make a fool of me? There are no Europeans left in that hotel. Get me the names of all the cockroaches in there.
What do you want?
Was there blood?
I'm going to put you on the third floor.
Your brother's here?
Simon, next door, the Charingas' boy.
No.
Why didn't you call your contacts in the army?
Paul, don't let them die.
Them. They almost got us all killed. I have done enough for them! We cannot look after them anymore.
How can we help him.
They are being evacuated.
Your card says Hutu. Take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks. Get them out. Please.
To Rutagunda's place. It is close by.
Please, Paul, why do we have to go to the roof?
I have a confession. When we met...
It was substantial.
A car.
Let me go. Children get off.
Oh, my babies.
I managed to get the President of France on the phone.
Rutaganda's place?
What is it like to fly on a plane, sir?
Twelve are dead.
What do we do with all these people?
How much beer?
The French. They supply the Rwandan army.
No, I don't want you going on the street.
Moses, Moses Seradungu.
Take a bow, Steven, you've outdone yourself tonight -- scared holy hell out of even me.
We'd've been splitsville years ago, with me the richest single woman in recorded history -- but Steven doesn't "believe" in divorce.
-- Price killed her, there's no other explanation --
How much more do they need than your death at his hands?
Part of the original structure. When it was still an asylum. Guy who ran the place -- Dr. Vannacutt -- found it "inspirational." From some German cathedral a million years ago: "Driving the Demons From the Mind."
Oh, for chrissake --
Just for the record: what are the rest of your names?
What?
Where is it??
Yeah, what the hell, I'll go.
Shouldn't somebody like, stand guard or something -- just in case?
'Less the place really is haunted.
So, what? You're saying we're stuck here the rest of our lives?
What's in there?
So you're saying as long as that door stays locked, we're okay?
What's down there?
How's a goddamn building gonna send out invitations?
Hail Mary, full of grace -- the house is growing!
Pritchett, is that you?
This is nuts.
I told you already: Jennifer Jenzen, Executive V.P. of --
I was upstairs with Eddie --
-- you lose either way, Price --
What are you looking for?
Price!!
Where did it go?
Better put it on hold 'til we find Pritchett.
-- forget it. Last birthday the Manson Family Ranch, the year before that: Jonestown.
Don't touch me!
I'm not laughing, Steven.
I gave you a goddamn guest list two pages long -- where the hell are they?
You know how happy I'd be if that was really true, Evelyn? And how positively goddamn delirious if you weren't fucking every living thing in our area code at the same goddamn time!
Evelyn... Get up... NOW!
You think this is fucking funny??
Do something!
She's been marked for it. The House does that. Happened to Pritchett's father. Likely happen to you all. Isn't that what you told me, Mr. Pritchett?
-- it's getting older by the second. Mr. Price, if I could just please have --
House 2, Guests 0.
Yeah. Why's there five checks? There's only four of us.
What're you talking about?
Jennifer-Jenzen-Executive-V.P.- Paragon-Pictures.
Sorry.
I was upstairs!
Fascinated.
Then tell me, please -- help me...!
-- hey! Next time give me a couple seconds notice before you wing a gag like that!
But the million bucks each, that's for real?
Oh, no.
Don't know that it does.
You should really open this place to the public, Pritchett -- a spa for people without enough stress in their lives.
Ghosts killed your father?
Pritchett, what is this "core of darkness"?
Price!
Damn it.
It doesn't say.  But that's not what interests me.  There's no death certificate for the daughter.  Anywhere.
They don't build them like this anymore.
Town records are coming up now.
I have to admit you really have a beautiful home.
I have to admit I was skeptical.  Until now.
It will heal.
Where does this amulet come from?
Can you talk to her?
Aubrey, come on down and have some dinner!
H-how long will it take?
Can I have this room daddy?
What will Aubrey think?
The heater's here.
What is it?
Weird sounds, things moving, lights going off.  The videotape...
A friend?
I'm fine.
You don't think I know?
You're bleeding.
I think we should do it.
What do you mean, unfortunately?
Ok, so we have a...presence.  What do we do about it?
I'm not sure, but I can check.  Did the events start before or after you discovered this?
She attended the church for years. A dear woman, it was sad to see her decline so rapidly.
She's coming back.  Keep talking!
I hope everything works out for you, and you find happiness in your new home.
Well it all depends on how much money you want to spend.  A standard visit would run you about fifty pounds.  That would include myself and an assistant.
C'mon, Joey.  I'm just trying to help you hit a home run here.
Right.  Like last night's doozie.
Well done.  Brave girl.  You've probably never shaken hands with a ghost before, am I right?
It was off the statue.  In the club.
I put some decaf on.  Er ... make yourself comfortable.
... well, I've been having it for years. It's not a nightmare or anything.  It's ... well, I know what it is.
Great.  Thanks.  You gonna have one?
I figured I'd make breakfast.
How have you ... ?
Wow.  Lotta books.  You read all these?
Cool.  I read a book once.  It was like all these people discovering who they used to be.  You know, like reincarnation?  It was really good.  You ever read that?
But I don't know what's going on.
Yeah.  I found it.  I knew held like it and I figured ...
You gonna buy?
Uh-huh.
Thank you.
He's a barman.  Whatever.  Do you mind if I continue?
Do you mind me talking about your stuff?
But you gave me a rose ...
You ... I can't fucking believe you, you bastard!  You get me in here ...
Not quite.  This wasn't here.
Yeah ... yeah, it looks different.
Well, forget about it.  Hawk and I are going to Rio.  We're hurt, we're tired, and a hero ain't nothing but a sandwich.  Right, buddy?...
That's your definition of "Hard?"
Alex, did you know this ape was going to be here...
The safe's a Simpson 71.  Last time I played the game, Simpson only had a 40.
I'm sorr--Goddamn Mario Brothers. Goddamn Gates.  Goddamn Rutherford Auction House.  By the way, how many seconds?
Whoa, you better cut a bigger hole than that.
Cameras?
"And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo."
Attempt, you mean.  The vanity of this man, Hudson Hawk.  The Vatican has foiled the advances of Pirates and Terrorists.  We will not lie down for some schmuck from New Jersey.  Must you flirt with him so realistically?
You got it.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is a bad joke and I'm the punchline.  I thought we were using the CIA to help us to get Mayflower, but really the CIA was using me to keep us away from Mayflower.
I'm going to find out.
No, I meant you didn't have to tackle me and rip my dress.  A polite push, perhaps?  A clear shout of "watch out, Anna" would have done nicely...
Whoa, part 2.  Does it go to Times Square?
Oh Hudson, I was worried you weren't going to drop by....
The C.I. what?  God, no...
I-work-for-a-covert-Vatican-humanitarian- organization.  The-CIA-made-a-fool-of-me. I-care-for-you...
Da Vinci made the real directions in a secret script that I decoded. The way the machine is running now, the gold will produce too quickly, clog, and the machine will shut itself down.  Isn't it wonderful?
It's the site of their new museum and we're taking it over.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is going full speed ahead.
No, let me!
Alchemy!  Is the business term of the 90's, my man!  Minerva read about it in an airline magazine about four years ago.  I dumped some lira into research... Shazam, we come across a diary by one of Da Vinci's apprentices detailing La Machine de Oro, the gold machine for those at home, and the rest is about to become history.  Money isn't everything, gold is.  Fuck blue chip stocks!  Fuck T-bills! Fuck Junk Bonds!  I got the real deal!  Money will always be paper but gold will always be gold!
I look at you Soviet people and I feel... pity... superiority.  Most of your life, your government has told you that Capitalism turns people into robots who'd rather eat microwave sushi, naked in the back of a Cadillac than hear the laughter of children.
So Hawkasaurus, I won't mince words...
You wouldn't be out if it wasn't for me!  I did dog and pony for you!  You think they would have let you out after what you did, you told the board members they looked like the Three Stooges...
Remember that guy in the cell next to you who hung himself?
Hudson Hawkins gets the chair of honor.  How about a Gates-arita?  I used real hot dogs.
This is the worst night...
You know Kaplan, if you weren't the slimiest pinata of shit that ever lived, I'd feel sorry for you.
Don't be stupid...they...
Damnit, I hate this!  I'm a cat burglar!  Nobody said anything about this fight-to-the-death shit.
Don't I know you...
Why does this have to be so hard...
We'll call it the Flying Donut!
Something short.
Nobody told me! Nobody told me! You sold all of our stock?
So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes president.
I'm sorry we had to take the stairs. It was just that horrible little elevator boy...
Well, I --
I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean.
Norville... there's something I have to tell you. You see, I'm not really a secretary.
...You do?
...Certain people are --
Oh yes! In Muncie!
Yes, you can get carrot juice or Italian coffee, and the people there -- well, none of them quite fit in. You'd love it -- why don't you come there with me -- they're having a marathon poetry reading on New Year's Eve. I go every year.
Oh, I don't know. Maybe I was just a fast-talking career gal who thought she was one of the boys --
You mean you know about this?
...On payday! The only story here is how this guy made a monkey out of you, Al.
Muncie.
Forty-four, the top brass floor say, buddy! What takes fifty years to get up to the top floor and thirty seconds to get down?
Wuddya mean, buddy?
Aw, please, sir -- this job, it's all I got!
...You don't?
Absolutely, Buzz, I'm glad he --
But look, I'm president of the company now and I --
-- So we'd gone out to the Hamptons and the garden was in positive ruins!
...Who let you in?
...You know, for kids! Which is perfect for Hudsucker -- not that I claim to be any great genius; like they say, inspiration is 99 percent perspiration, and in my case I'd say it's at least twice that, but I gotta tell ya, Mr. Mussburger, sir, this sweet baby --
All right, but you didn't excel in your studies...?
...'Shnook'? 'Dope'? 'Dipstick'? 'Lamebrain'?
My God! The Bumstead contracts!!
Thank you, Sid, but the reason I mention it is, it would require such a small capital investment -- again, you're the expert here --
Finally.
...Congratulations, kid, you've really outdone yourself. Reinvented the wheel. I'm going to recommend to the Board that we proceed immediately with this, uh... with the, uh... that the dingus be mass-produced with all deliberate speed. Of course, as president of the company the ultimate decision is yours.
I got gas, Bennie.
No kiddin', Bennie. I got gas.
...He's not noticing, Benny.
Hello, Niagara.
She's good, Bennie.
Good morning, miss.
A man, miss -- an old man who lives in the garden at Fort Holland - with arrows stuck in him and a sorrowful, weeping look on his black face.
No, miss.  He's just as he was in the beginning -- on the front part of an enormous boat.
I think you need some help.
I really intended going out to the Fort and meeting you long before this, Miss Connell.  I'm Mrs. Rand -- Wesley's mother.
Some of this native nonsense. The Houngan has his prescription and Dr. Maxwell and I have ours.
A missionary's widow?  It isn't very likely, is it?
Mrs. Rand...
Does she suffer?
I've worked with it.  I've seen cures. It is at least a hope.
Where were you trained?
But it's so far away...
-- But, you're an American?
As a matter of fact, it means the sugar syrup is ready to be poured off.  You'll have to excuse me.
But what in the world can you do with a day off in St. Sebastian?
But don't you have to work?
Don't let it bother you so, Wes.
You know what she is!  That's death -- no mind, no senses -- no love, no hate, no feeling -- nothing!
Can't I take it for you?
I heard someone crying -- a woman --
That's hard to believe, after what happened last night.
Surely nurses aren't afraid of the dark?
A mental case?
You didn't find your patient so frightening in the daylight, did you?
I heard about your little misadventure yesterday, Miss Connell.  On your first "day off," too.
Well?
Don't take it to heart, Betsy.
I've been waiting here for hours, trying to imagine Jessica well again -- wondering what I'd feel. I could see Jessica as she used to be, I could hear her say in that sweet mocking voice, "Paul, darling..."  The whole thing beginning all over again...
I told you.
That's past -- that's over and done with...
I think I do.  I've often talked a little voodoo to get medicine down a patient's throat.
What about her?
Investigation of what?
In other words, I'm on trial.
Dr. Maxwell is right, Mother.
Well, Jeffries, why come to us about it?  Why don't you go up to the Houmfort and put a stop to the drumming and dancing -- that's what causes all the trouble.
That could be a serious accusation, Rand, if it weren't a foolish one.
The Halfords have invited us again this year.
Oh yeah. Musk, or something. You like it?
You crying?
What?
I get you loud and clear... hey, you look nice.
Oh, just dropping off a coffee cup. Jim left it, last time he was over. It was on the dash of the car. You were, you know, reading, thought I'd just catch some air. Let's eat.
I have no idea.
I'm not surprised.
If you're going to insult me --
This just isn't the best moment for this.
Elena.
I'll drive you --
Yeah. Well, we can just --
Hi dad.
Well dad, actually I thought I'd take the morning train on Thanksgiving -- got a lot of studying, papers, you know, lab experiments --
Um, Paul. On second thought, can you do me a favor and pretend I never said any of that.
What the hell are you kids doing down here?
Talking to me, dad?
He's probably been waiting all night at the station.
But dad, you guys truly hated each other, I mean really hated each --
-- What advice? You never --
That was a joke? You don't tell jokes.
Welcome to the Monkey House has been a seminal influence on me -- hey Benjamin -- give it a try? This stuff will make some sense out of those larger questions.
And to think -- they met at a key party of all things.
Thanks, but -- oh, I don't think so. It's been kind of a discouraging evening.
Look, Elena, the fact that we're neighbors... you know, close friends, well it sort of makes this a little strange, don't you think?
Now don't make me feel as if I'm being too forward, OK? If you don't --
Okay. Shall we clean up around here first? Do you think it's all right--
I saw you on your bike today.
We're going to the Halford's. The number's on the calendar in the kitchen. We should be home around 11.
Thanks again. For the dinner.
It's been a tremendously transformative year -- maybe a little controversial of course, but we're breaking down the old Unitarian barriers --
You're here... I'm a bit surprised.
Paul, cancel your mental appointments, baby. What are you, like still stoned from last night?
And whence has yon virginal maiden absconded?
Check it out. Not for the faint of heart.
Awesome sleet and rain.
No candy for me?
Come on Paulie, share the wealth. You copped 'em from her mom's stash anyway.
Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it since he was born.
Would it matter?  And what's that?
It's beyond mere physical attraction.
How do you know this shit?
You think Francis is going to beat me to the punch here?
Mikey?
Geometry?
It's freezing.
I don't ever want to see you.
You have to follow me?
Maybe we can mess around. You know, only if you want to...
I'm sorry if I got you into trouble. Maybe we don't have to, you know... unless you really want to.
Charles.
Hello, Charles.
How are the parental units functioning these days?
Her name's Libbets.
Is this Charles?
Right.
Well, you can...
It feels warm.
Good.
My partner...
You did your homework, Officer.
Guess that's what they call Alaskan hospitality.
Do it again.
Who's that?
I'm going back to the Lodge, Ellie. Still need to go through some of Kay Connell's school records.
Not really.
It's legitimate.
No.
We're sure it's hers?
That's right.
What happened at that signing?
She wasn't happy.  I was someone to talk to.
Eight years.
What do you want to talk about?
Looks like the natives are restless.
Did you love her?
Just stuff.  I don't fucking remember.
I don't know.
Hey...
She kept saying she was gonna get out of here.  Leave us all behind.  That <i>he</i> was going to take her!
Where's your back-up?
You're not following procedure.
Monstrous.
So you have the answers...
I have not spoken to him...
I was waiting for you...
But why?
Where is she? Where's Claudia?
Not without Claudia. Where is she?
I couldn't prevent it.
I'm not your daughter.
You always give me the doll on the same night of the year.
But you're the fairest by far.
Yes. And I'll tell you something else! I've met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you.
Laudanum!
Claudia! You did that?
You want me to be a doll forever?
You see the old woman? That will never happen to you. You'll never grow old. You will never die.
But now's the time to end it, Louis. Now's the time to leave him.
In Europe, Louis. We shall meet our own kind. Find the one who made him. Learn what it means.
Louis, look at me.
A beautiful child! Is that what you still think I am?
Mortals, mortals everywhere. And lots of drops to drink.
They use no paint. And the audience think it is paint.
This is no performance.
Do you think I would let them harm you?
He wants you as you want him. He's been waiting for you. He wants you for a companion. He bides his time that place. he finds them as dull and lifeless as we do.
Do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? When he put me in that trance...
You have to ask me for this. You have to want it, do you hear me?
Vampires. We thrive on blood.
Don't worry. He was white trash, they come at two a penny. I dumped him in the swamp and untied the slave, licked his wounds clean.
Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong.
You're body's dying. Pay no attention. It will take twenty minutes at most.
Yes, that's you, my handsome friend. And you'll look that way till the stars fall from heaven.
Read her thoughts.
I learnt absolutely nothing. I wasn't give a choice, remember?
Lestat, she's alive!!!!
The girl, Lestat -
She's here, your wounded one.
Lestat!
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
Claudia, Claudia, will you never learn? Who will we get now to finish your dress? A little practicality, cherie...
No... You come back to me Louis...
Still beautiful Louis. You always were the strong one.
And they frighten you?
So you want me to tell you the story of my life...
It's just a room...
You were going to kill me? Drink my blood?
You believe this, don't you? That you're a vampire? You really think...
How did you do that?
You said the slave had a crucifix...
You loved your wife, surely.
And did you lose her? Did she go?
You found nothing?
Duh. The next couple of days is gonna be rough, but we'll make it.
I want off this island.
I thought you were out of town!
I'm not going anywhere. I'm fat, ugly, and depressed.
There's nothing between Will and me.
You gotta sell his butt on the Bahamas?
But, he said he'd try.
Their stuff in there...  ...and ours in here.
Think about this, Julie. What did you actually see?
You get any sleep at all?
What do you mean?
I know I don't want to stay in here.
Be careful, Julie.
I'm holding your hand!
Oh, god, it's you --
Every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first.
No, I shouldn't have left so fast... I was just...
Ray, Karla won a trip to the Bahamas! An island called Tower Bay. And she wants us to come with her.
Julie, we're working a big run up here. It's been crazy. We probably have to go out again tonight. I don't think I can do it.
Ray...what are you doing?
Never do that again.
I love it here.
You're the most beautiful woman in the bar tonight, Jules.
It just takes time, Julie. It's gonna get better.
It was one year ago...
Nah. I'll probably just be here studying for finals. The joys of summer school...  Are you okay?
And it's been blue skies all day. It might be perfect all weekend.
Julie? What's wrong?
No -- it's not that. It's...I'm just a little on edge. I'm really sorry.
What? What are you talking about? Where?
Come on. We're gonna be okay.
Estes came after me with a gaffing hook.
Why are you doing this to me?
...Why?
If you can say all you gotta say in a minute then I don't wanna hear it.
Worse comes to worse, you can stand there and watch me.
Okay, I just didn't wanna get my hair wet.
I used to be a lifeguard...I'd hate to have to blow my whistle.
You think that's a good place to hide?
Why? He can't help us.
Mark in the Morning! Magic 96.7! Oh my God! I'm Karla. Karla Wilson.  Jules, it's Mark in the Morning.
Don't really have the market for something like this...  I can go two...two-fifty.
Where is everybody?
They're around...They just don't care about us 'cause we're the contest winners.  Let's go find Stoner Boy...Make his lazy butt hook us up with fishing poles or Ping-Pong paddles or something.
We'll only be a second, okay?
I took it for granted you gentlemen were refugees as are my other guests.
I need your advice —— something has happened —— Mr.  Jacks ——
All the more reason to watch him. He's had some wild notions lately.
Goodbye.
The ancient Greeks had just as good an explanation -- that the gods sent the plague to punish mortals for harboring Vrykolaka --
There was some trouble here ——the villagers on the mainland —-this island was the focal point of their anger. They came here ——broke open the tombs and despoiled the graves.
Perhaps I had better stay. I am tired.
You were singing, weren't you? A beautiful voice, Miss St. Aubyn.
I adore hearing Thea sing -- but my poor head's beginning to ache.  I'm so sorry.
I'm glad you and the General didn't have to leave us. We would feel quite deserted..
If Mr. Albrecht is right, we'll all be free in a few days.  I suppose you'll be going on to Athens?
Has she spoken to you of her father and her mother?
The young man, Mr. Davis, seems to be some kind of an unofficial observer —— a correspondent of some sort ——
You are fortunate in your father.
I have forgotten it, dear.
Your father loved me.  He wanted to marry me. But he was afraid of hurting the gentle, delicate Cathy. You spoiled his life ——you've ruined mine ——
I have not had a happy life --but that one thing - - that terror which brings me awake out of deep sleep —- I want to avoid it.
That's superstition. That's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live —- I'm talking of something else --cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real.
This girl --
You know that sound, Oliver?
Do you mind if I go with you?
You are a happy man Oliver. You have but one world to live in —- the world of today. I have two worlds. I have that old dark world of peasant ignorance and superstition in which I was brought up and a new world which the army gave me —— a world of mathematics, gun ranges,logistics, tactics, strategy.
I will be glad to leave this island. It has too much of that old dark world about it. I will be glad to leave it and that girl ——
There is something evil about her.
I had a notion you had become self—appointed chaperone lately — why?
I have had command for the last time —-
Theodosia --
Please.. You shouldn't laugh --
Why in the world can't you?
Come on, we got to get this up. He's coming.
Stand back.
Good morning, sir.
What'd you say?
You have no car.
Oh, I don't know. Either I'm off my nut, or he is . . .  . . . or you are!
No.
Oh-oh. Somebody's just made it.
Look, I think maybe you better not mention getting your wings around here.
Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?
Poor George . . . Sit down.
Where? I don't see a thing.
Did he ever marry the girl? Did he ever go exploring?
. . . two of them as they were about to crash into a transport full of soldiers.
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.
Thank you very much.
Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy . . .
Oh –– Clarence. Hasn't got his wings yet, has he? We've passed him up right along.
Hi, Daddy.
What?
What's that?
Hmmmm . . .
Hmmm . . .
Sure –– Sam Wainwright.
You're not paid to be a canary.
Anything I can do back here?
Mr. Gower, I think . . .
Oh, it's wonderful.
Mr. Gower! Mr. Gower! This is George Bailey! Don't you know me?
How's that?
This town is no place for any man unless he's willing to crawl to Potter. You've got talent, son. You get yourself an education. Then get out of here.
Well, you remember my kid sister, Mary?
Hey, George . . .
I know, but . . .
Hello.
Holy mackerel!
All right. All right. Now we'll go over every step you took since you left the house.
Yes, sir.
You wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town, buying your wife a lot of fine clothes, a couple of business trips to New York a year, maybe once in a while Europe. You wouldn't mind that, would you, George?
Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success? I'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. Is it a deal or isn't it?
Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and talk about it to your wife.
Rochester? Well, why Rochester?
Well, I don't.
Me?
Hot dog! Just like an organ.
Well, why don't you say it?
Too young or too old?
If I told you it might not come true.
Ouch!
How's that?
When did you get back?
After that, who cares?
Oh, Mary . . .
Where's your coat and hat?
I guess you forgot something.
Great!  Find one for me.
I can't wait to get there.
Sure you do -- you win either way.
Oh, shit.
Don't!
Get on the rocks!
Maybe by now they are.
If you're beached, why are we doing this?  For practice?
Turkeys!  Eat wind!
Same as always -- glub-glub, bubble-bubble, stroke-stroke. There sure is some weird shit on the bottom of the ocean.
The lighthouse?
Why'd they decide to move?
Goddamn it, Sean, you listen to me or I will kick your ass, do you hear me?
Coming up!
How're we going to do that floating on this garbage...?
Tina!
Good morning!
On your own time?
We got a helluva tide this month.
I missed you at the funeral home. Santos said you were here.
Positive I.D.?
Of course not,  They're closed. Phil Fogarty's place.  He'll do it for me.
About 10 degrees off your star- board bow, take a heading leeward of Sand Island, and lay her north by northeast....
See where Cable Junction is?  Look to the left.  The lighthouse.  That's it.
You stay here a minute.
Pop....
Mike?  Is that you?
Jesus, don't freeze on me.  What about the others?
I don't know what you did, but that kid stopped.  I haven't heard one peep, not one 'breaker breaker' for days.  Believe me, it's a pleasure....
It came up during the meeting.
Is that what it is?  Dollars? Money?  I'll pay for it.  Take it out of my salary.
Maybe I don't make as much money as some bullshit rip-off artists around here, but I don't work the same way.
As soon as I heard about it, I called you.  This thing is big! His arms indicate big.
Do you?
What makes you think there might be?
This is a mammal, not a fish.
Where the hell were you?
Do I have to talk to those two?
Can you take a little time out from your busy schedule to dance with the old man?
Mmmm.
Thank you.  I'll tell him.
All summer?
The goddamn smell is always the same. 
Because of today?  The beach?
I know you did....
What're you doing?
Of course I can, but can't it wait? These things cost money, and this town doesn't have much money.
And I stood by while you told the people from Ramada and Marriott that if they put up a hotel they'd need $800,000 worth of steel net around their beaches!  In New England? We all lost on that one.
Martin, when we build up our tax base a little, you can have every- thing you want; right now, the town's broke.
That's it.  Just do it, all right?
If they're not at the light, look for them.  I don't want them out there.  Get them back to port!
Harbor Air, do you read?  Over?
Did you say Cable Junction?
Can I go swimming?
Can I go with you today?
They made me go with them.
I told you, remember?
My cousin will be here tomorrow.
You're not going out right away, are you?
Whoops, almost lost one.  Can't play with the dolphins without skis....
Terry!  You okay?
Anyone know what time it is?
What about sailing?
Be careful....
What about me?
I don't think she's such hot stuff.
Yeah.
And if you have any questions about recreational possibilities, Ellen Brody here will be happy to answer them.
Wave to my son.
You should've been out there.  You should've seen him waving that gun, like a maniac.  There were shots fired!
So it can't be done like that.  The man's a menace, plain and simple.
We're going to have to cover the entire lagoon.
Aren't you suiting up, mate?
That macho pompous English --
My imagination isn't that good.
They're coming with us?
Where's the rubber band?
Damn it!
Let's head to the gate and work our way back.
Where are you going?
Here.
You want me to stay?
Finally.
Yes.  It's faster.
Michael, take deep breaths.
... I have to go, honey.  Phillip and I are going down together to kill the shark.
I am.  You're not.
Michael, you don't have to go down there.
You don't have to prove anything.
Go where?
They're not tricks.  They're behavior patterns.
Three hundred million years of evolution have created the greatest butcher the world's ever known.
Lunch for Whitey.  Something to munch on in case things get dicey.
Kiss him, maybe he'll turn into a frog.
Could be a new dance...  Walking the Shark.
I like it when they wake up.
You were quite daring in capturing him.  Very skillful indeed.
Some miss all their shots.
That's what life is, Doctor. Full of chances to hurt yourself, or somebody else.
He's a young one.
I was seeing this guy off.  He flew in from Dallas.  Wants to marry me.  He's okay, but Texans are so possessive.
I haven't seen that much, but so far it looks great.
How come?
Yes, it's great!
Come on, it's fun!
The space shuttle has landed!
What're you doing later?
Ahhh, ahhh...
Gotta sneeze.
Back, Kelly.  Lean back!
Did you see that?
Yes, there is goes.
Bring the crane over.  Come down. Easy down.
Tradition.  Royal sense of adventure that's been in my family for centuries.  Dates back to the Crusades and King Richard.  What I was born to do.
Actually, thirty-five is probably more accurate.
We see him, Mike.  Between the stadium and the ski show island.
How'd you do in school?
Hey, I'm proud of you, kid.
Okay, you two, have a good life without me.  I gotta go.
She still talking to you?
Sure.
Come on, sweetheart....
Big unveiling ceremony in a couple of weeks....
I miss him, Matt.  I still can't believe he's gone.
It doesn't take much to remember what day they come....
I take out the garbage, because...I'm glad we got that straightened out....
No fair, I'm not armed.
Close the door.
Where is she?
I used to worry...But you know what happens, you find out that scuba diving's safer than climbing into the bathtub....
Henny Youngman....
You want to try your hand at something...?
All he did was kiss me....
Michael!  This thing working?
Get the bang sticks.  We're going down.
We don't want any....
Yes!
Can I ride one sometime...?
I never....
I like Grandma's cooking....
You're coming, aren't you...?
You're damn right I'm serious....
Hey, come on, you can't believe that voodoo.  Sharks don't commit murder. They don't pick out a person....
Nothing out of the ordinary....
I want you to give up your work....
You're having a good time....
No more sharks.  I'll stay for another week, then....
You look tired....
I'm leaving in a few days.  I don't want to do that with you unhappy....
I'm worried.. We haven't had our....
We will...We'll have a lot of time together, Michael....
Sometimes I think I'm going crazy. The nightmares....
Depends on where you want to go....
I'm only doing this to get out of my family's hair....
You're impossible....
You promised me a drink....
Couple of more passes and I'll buy my own airplane.. Hell, maybe my own airline....
Our little island seems to agree with you....
I borrow it without telling him....
I'll get it back next time.
Want to go for a little ride?
I hope she's a good sailor....
When we find her we'll radio her position...The Coast Guard will pick her up.  Don't worry....
Grab your socks....
Come on, Hoagie....
I don't know what the hell to say....
Still tagging conch?
Would you talk to her?  She's got it in her head that the shark came for him.  She still blames it for my father's death....
They won't fight with me....
Maybe I missed you too....
Office of Naval Research has some money....
He's just trying to keep you from disappearing up your own....
Oh, it's okay for you, but not for me....
I wish you wouldn't say that....
You guys are making this into some- thing that just isn't so... It's just a shark.  A great big bloody wonderful shark.  Don't say anything to anyone. The locals find out they'll panic. They'll want to kill it.  We've got us a great white, Michael. We're going to do us some real research....
We're out of money, partner.. We wrap it up, write it up and turn it in... How come your heart sounds stronger than mine?  You got two of them...?
When I invited you...
We've got a rare bird here, Michael. Great whites don't come to the Bahamas.  There's never been one down here before.  I'm not just going to let it swim away.
You sure you've done this before?
Bring her to starboard.
Who?
What about Carla's gig?
You getting a reading on them?
Shit....
All the time....
How much longer?  This is supposed to be your party.
Don't go weak in the knees on me tonight....
She's in management....
Woman has taste....
That man keeps calling about his training film.  I can't convince him we don't have a S.W.A.T. team.
Where's Lenny?
I dunno .. Guess the dozer musta shifted him? You need some hands up here to look ..
Mr Blattis, of our local news- paper. You sure it's a suicide?
There's nothing in the files?
You gotta stop smoking ..
Why don't you dump it? Mail it off. Give the fucking F.B.I. a present?
This looks promising .. I think this one could be it?
Alright, I didn't, but I nearly did, and if I had I'd have been right .. I knew there was some- thing about that Labrador, that dog was too good to be dead .. We gotta get back up that dump ..
That's what I'm here for. I want you to come and see Citrine with me?  He's not gonna here it from me but I know he'd listen to you.
I wanna take that fucking Blind In- stitute to pieces .. Every address book, every phone call, everyone in and outta there in the last 5 years ..
Did I say he did?
That's a very stupid question, Ross.
Yeah .. I guess she's in the kit- chen .. We got a so-called prof- essional cook out there having a nervous breakdown over a turkey ..
You got a quiet phone somewhere?
You're pushing this too hard. It's like you <u>want</u> me to say <u>stop</u>? You must know that's the way this is going, John? There's other work to do, why don't ya ease off a little?
It could be anyone's hand. Illeg- ally disposed of hospital debris ..
Got a letter from this Goodridge guy? Says, you're upsetting his students?
I'll sign anything you want. <u>Please</u>. Bring here her .. <u>I want Helena here</u> ..
You don't know what you done, Taylor.
I've told you the truth. It isn't me .. I've never call- ed Ross "Freddy" in my life ..
As recent as we have .. What ex- actly is your interest in Amber?
Then what are you hoping I'm gon- na do? Dissuade, or persuade you?
Yes, Sir.
Well, apparently, she saw Amber the weekend she left, & was briefly in the room with the guy she left with.
Well, I think I told you on the phone .. I went up to her room to say good-bye, and we just sat on the bed and chatted a while, while her friend was coming in and out collecting her things ..
The elevator wasn't working?
D'you have a dog? Seeing Eye Dog?
Have you been here long?
I suppose I'm the worst witness you've ever had?
No.
"Thoughts that lie too deep for tears."
I don't know, I haven't read much. I don't think poetry's my kinda thing?
Just your age.
I have to talk to you, Helena.
You're looking more worried now than when you "decided to stop worrying"?
Why can't I stay with you?
Don't say that. Don't you <u>dare</u> say that .. <u>I believe you</u>  ..
The man who killed Amber is a psychopath. He was up at the in- stitute to <u>kill you</u> - he don't wanna kill Rose - he was there to <u>kill you</u> - that's the truth - and I didn't wanna tell it to you - but that's the reason I want you to stay at Margie's - coz I can't protect you here ..
Coz he thinks you're a witness.
He don't know that. I didn't.
You do?
What does that mean?
Bobby's out .. What's the hurry?
Damn A, it's O.K. With a bit of luck I'm goin home. What we got?
Where do you fit in, Trimble?
I think I found some- thing horrible, Sir
I know.  Sorry I threw a scare into our lives there --
I have to finish my job --
Don't let him stay up too late.
He's asleep, right?
This is fuckin Michael Jordan, man! They should be screaming.
I know who y6u are.  You're Dorothy Boyd.  You're in... wait... you're in Accounts.  You have the middle cubicle toward the back with that poster of Albert Einstein morphed onto Shaquille 0 Neal's body.
I think in this age, optimism like that... it's a revolutionary act.
So I know this is a bad time, but -- you will have a medical program, right?
But I mean really... wonderfully...  great.
That took guts.
Honey -- later, okay?  Whoop.  Wait.
It's all going to work.
It's all going to work.  We're going to save the world.
Hey you.
-- especially one like this.
We're two people working together and we can't have an atmosphere.
I mean, the other night was... I felt like you understood something I could barely even say, something way down deep in the murk --  -- but we have a company here to think about.  I won't ever take advantage of you in that way again.
Wow.  That's more than a dress. That's an Audrey Hepburn movie.
We'll see you soon, honey. Bye.
Well -- this would be goodnight.
Sure you're okay to drive this?
What --
There's no question you'll be friends. Of course you'll be friends.
I heard.
This guy would go home with a gardening tool right now if it showed interest.  Wait.  Use the frosted glasses.
That's the girl I love.
No no.  Don't cry at the beginning of the date.
No, Roy.  I'm not gonna cry.
Oh yes.  Jerry Maguire!  My agent! This is a fierce, loving individual, I love this man, he is love, he is about love -- my ambassador of kwan.
Not right now, Jerry.
I'm sorry, I --
Sure you don't want to go out and find some karoake?  I'm a very good singer, man --
You are not allowed to act this way.
Did you tell him about the "ten million for four years?"
Yeah, man, it means love, respect, community... and the dollars too. The package.  The kwan.
Is that your porty or mine?
You're telling me to dance.
Do your job, man, don't tell me to dance.
What's wrong.
I'm out here for you!  You don't know what it's like to be me out here for you. It is an up-at-dawn pride-swallowing seige that I will never fully tell you about! Okay?! Help me help you help me help you.
You know when you know.  It makes you shivver, it eats at your insides. You know?
Well, just stay healthy. I will show you the kwan.
I'm asking you a question --
I don't want to be friends anymore.
Beautiful.
Oh, tell the story.
To the pools?
Which they do.  And we're standing there. All the football guys are in the lobby, watching, there's even an ESPN crew.  So I turn to her and sort of grandly say, "Well, this is me, Klutz, asking you, Goddess of Rock Climbing, to marry me." And I took out the ring, and I don't much like big scenes, but she said "yes" right there in the lobby and some of the toughest men in football wept like babies.  We're getting married in February.
You gonna get that --
Marcee, things are changing around here.  You and Rod will have my total personal attention.
... dick?
You wanted smaller.
Jerry --
He's gonna have nothing left for next season.  They're letting him kill himself.
ERRR-IIIC!
Still, you have survived the dinosaurs before. You saved those kids.
This is how you make dinosaurs?
Amanda and I, well, we just love the outdoors. Heck we've been on pretty much any adventure tour they can come up with: Galapagos, K2, the Nile...
Fine...and when the Tricyclatops comes after you, don't come crying to me.
I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...
Udesky.
Sweetheart, you're okay.  You're okay.  You're okay.
PAUL!
Where's Dad?
So Mr. Kirby, tell me, when you climbed K2, did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet?
How was your trip? Profitable?
Even with what I pay you, you could get a better bag.
Is it a rex?
We could co-write a paper.
You have to believe me. I did it with the best intentions.
Anything good?
We've done cranial scans, and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber. I have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence. The way they can work together as a team.
When InGen cleared out, they left a lot of stuff behind.
Know what this is?
We need to head for the coast.
Bonitas.
The lady you called, how do you know she can help us?
We're safe!
What do you think is going to happen with the dinosaurs?
That's a very nice offer, Mr. Kirby, but I'm afraid I'm much to busy. If you like I can refer you to a number of highly qualified...
Dr. Grant if you'd just sit tight, we'll explain this all in a jiffy.
There is no Kirby Enterprises, is there?
Well that's good.
I got a call from a gentleman who's going to Costa Rica, or thereabouts. If he's to be believed, it's a most, uh, unique expedition.  And very well-funded.
Make a blind here?  Wait for the buck to return?
You hear something?
"Minimal" is too much.   It has to be light, it has to be strong --
Why didn't you tell us about these guys, Ian?!
I didn't know you -- weren't well.
Why wouldn't they?  Look at hyenas, jackals, nearly all species of predator birds --
Hi, Dad.
I can't tell you.  But I'll be back within a week.
Peter, if you want me to run your little camping trip, there are two conditions.  First -- I'm in charge, and when I'm not around, Dieter is.  Your job is to sign the checks, tell us we're doing a good job, and open your case of scotch when we have a good day.  Second condition -- my fee.  You can keep it.  All I want in exchange for my services is the right to hunt one of the tyrannosaurs.  A male.  Buck only.  Why and how are my business. If you don't  like either of those conditions, you're on your own.  Go ahead and set up your camp right here, or in a swamp, or in the middle of a rex nest, for all I care.  But I've been on too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas.  Okay?
What kind of gun is that?
You rally think this'll draw the parent?
Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.
We took to the rock.
It's... behind... us.
You version of it.
What's he got in there?
What do they want?!
No.  I'm quite certain you can't.
Somewhere on this island, there exits the greatest predator that ever lived.  And the second greatest predator must take him down.
You know you were putting yourself in a potentially dangerous situation, but you didn't bother to find out how dangerous before you leapt in. You don't have the faintest idea what's going on on this island!
You're going home.  I'm sending a radio call for the boats.  We'll all go down to the lagoon and wait for them.
Oh, please.  How am I supposed to keep a straight face when --  -- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm going to Skull Island?
-- way we could safely --
Ruining everything, that's what they're doing.  You could choke on the diesel smoke already!
Give it more morphine!
We have to send someone to look for him!
You've got to be kidding.
Ladies and gentlemen, last shuttle to the dock leaves in approximately five minutes.  Drop what you are doing and leave now.
Phones are out too.
No, no, no, that's crazy, you're out of your mind, he's absolutely out of his mind - -
How long will this take?
What?  No menthol?
Alan?  Where are we going?  You see something?
Yours was fully illustrated, honey.
Carousel.
This is just a delay, that's all this is.  All major theme parks have had delays.  When they opened Disneyland in 1956, nothing worked, nothing.
Four complete skeletons. . . . such a small area. . . the same time horizon - -
Okay, who's the jerk?
Oh Ellie.  It's so beautiful.  It's the most beautiful thing I ever saw.
- - what happens is that after a while, the stones get smooth, every six weeks, so the animal regurgitates them - -
Ellie - - get back and boot up the door locks!
They show extreme intelligence, even problem solving. Especially the big one.  We bred eight originally, but when she came in, she took over the pride and killed all but two of the others.  That one - -when she looks at you, you can see she's thinking  working things out.  She's the reason we have to feed 'em like this. She had them all attacking the fences when the feeders came.
No. We can't.
It's anti-nature.
God creates dinosaurs.  God destroys dinosaurs.  God creates man.  Man destroys God.  Man creates dinosaurs.
You see?  The tyrannosaur doesn't obey set patterns or park schedules.  It's the essence of Chaos.
Uh - - thumb!  The same way.
If two experts sign off on the island, the insurance guys'll back off.  I already got Ian Malcolm, but they think he's too trendy.  They want Alan Grant.
- - from combined revenue streams for all three parks should reach eight to nine billion dollars a year - -
Have a heart gentlemen.  Their parents are getting a divorce and they need the diversion.
Okay, that's not so bad, ah Tim?
Go, go, go, jump!
You're married?
What'd I touch?!
Oh my God!
What?  What can we do?
And who in God's name do you think you are....?
I could compensate you by fully funding your dig
Blood temperature feels like high eighties.
Tim!  Lex!
Liar!  You said you wouldn't leave!
Hear that?  Are you hearing this?
Tim, Tim, Tim....
What if the dinosaur comes back while we're all asleep?
I like cows.
Do as he says!  The power's coming back, Timmy!
Shhhh.  Tim, I'm right here below you.  Easy catch. One, two, three.  You count it yourself.  One, two, three - -
It's am easy catch, you let - - go - - you do the counting, you count it, Tim.  One, two, three -- you do all the counting, okay?
I am gonna have to find the others and get you to a doctor.  Will you look after Tim, Lex?
A load, if I may say so. of fashionable number crunching, that¹s all it is!
You're right, John.  You're absolutely right. Everything's my problem.
Robert - - I wonder if perhaps you would be kind  good enough to take a gas jeep and bring back my grandchildren.
I'm sorry - - I'm sorry - -
Why are we hurrying if there's nothing wrong?
That's not funny.
Jump, Timmy!  It's too late!
You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!  The power's coming back!
Fifty.
No, but...
Beautiful trees... sturdy trunks... lots of branches...  We can do some great logging up here.
Jesus Christ!
I didn't think there were any houses up here...
Structure might be salvageable... let's see what the interior looks like.
Janet, are you okay? Are you there?
A house?
And this hand... it... it slashed Doctor Layton's throat... and the Deputy. Then it grabbed Danny by the head...  And it pulled his head right down into his chest... I couldn't... Hayes lays a hand his shoulder.
Doesnit sleep?
How do we prove it?
Cute waitresses?
Uh-huh...
See this?
Tomorrow. If you can clear it with the Sheriff's department.
If I'm right, this happened before the Krueger murders in Springwood.  That means that Jason might've been Krueger's first victim.
Where's he going?
Great. Now there's _two_ serial killers on the loose.
We're down to seven minutes.
You work in the insurance department?
It's only majestic from here. When you get closer you see it for what it really is.
A glorified office block.  They keep all the old records there -- the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living.
-- Ah, but what if it <u>wasn't</u>?
I read the one about the penal colony.
That would be even worse -- it would be a compromise.
I was restoring some stones here in the upper section one day -- and I found this.
The Castle gates were blockaded in the time of the great plague -- it's an escape route.  Don't get stuck.
-- You appreciate my writing.
Did you see him?
He's usually in the storage room sorting things out.  He can't close the file on a case until he has the concluding report.
To do my work well, I have little time for --
Excuse me, sir -- I understand you have Eduard Raban's file.
No, there's only one report to complete.  I'll be doing it myself and submitting it to the Castle today or tomorrow.
I'm Kafka -- I work upstairs in Accident --
Hello again.
What?
No, I don't.  I'm amazed that anyone is able to bear life with any assurance at all.
He wasn't robbed.  He was identified by his wallet.
Are you free tonight?
Eduard wanted to marry me.
The day he died, Eduard was called up to the Castle.  Did you know that?
When you only see someone sitting at a desk all day, it's liable to create a false impression.
I'm collecting Eduard's things. If there's anything you want, take it or I'll give it to charity.
How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?
And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?
I know there is.  And you're what I have to bargain with. For now you're the last one in their way.
Grown men don't normally fall into the river, do they?
Still, we're probably closer to you at the moment than any of your fellow human beings.
My assistants.  I should have known. Nothing is given to me.  I have to acquire everything.
-- You said so yourself the firm is large and powerful.  If the discrepancy really was something big, Eduard's responsibility would still have to be small.  No poor young <u>clerk</u> could find himself in such a fix.
And I suppose Dr. Murnau didn't die in a cave-in.  You killed him to free the Position of Orlac Medical Officer for your own ends.
"Raban" -- that'll be nearly at the back of the alphabet.
Wait a minute.  "Raban?"  Where have I heard that name?
This is the cross-reference of clerks who've worked on Orlac claims?
Once a file's been sent to the Caste, is it possible to recall it for review?
Oskar!
Hi - Carl Denham. I'm A big admirer of your work, sir. I've loved all your discoveries. I really want to work closely with you on this incredible find. It'll be good for you and good for me.
I hope it fits ... Mrs Denham's a big lady.
What have you got there?
Oh God, it's that bloody yank!
I want to thank you.
But . . . we can' t Jack, I need time to collect artifacts ... make sketches ... gather evidential information.
Give it back!
Barricade the gates! Quick!
Look, I've sailed these waters for twenty-seven years ... there's no island like that around here.
I guess that answers your questions. There's no island on these co- ordinates - not even a lousy fog-bank.
Pleased to meet you ... Hi, bow's it going? Pleased to meet you! Hi, Carl Denham ... How's it going?
We are a very modest and deeply religious people, Mr Denham.
They were just tasting the berries.
Not me. Thought I'd head out west ... get into some Redwood country.
Did you fear for your life?
Honey, a couple of years ago, with Jane and Frankie? -- Jane sent me a Dumper --
Sure dear, yes.
-- May I? It's so --
The truth is I hate them: they must hate me. All right, the money.  All right, not the money. A kind of put-on. It gets things back together.  Well let's say I'd go to one of these cattle-calls, a tryout. I mean before -- before I got this job -- and they'd always say thank you very much and i'd feel, you know, brought down. They didn't want me.
Well I have to close up now.
Why isn't he locked up?
Is that why Klute didn't tell me?
I don't have to look at anything. I don't have --
I'm not going to hurt you, absolutely, I'm not.
And you just want to ask me a few questions?
Company outing or picnic or something like that.
A name. Grunemann. Nothing. And they showed me pictures like this and they meant nothing. Then they asked me, well had I been getting letters, from someone out there in Cabbageville --
Nothing. Except he wasn't kidding. Usually it's a fakeout, you probably know. They pretend to tie you up, and you wear a dress with a cloth belt and they pretend to whip you or you --  Hell it's their money. I'll hang from the shower rod and whistle Maytime. Except this guy was really tripped out on it; he --
Everything that's happened since Tom Grunemann disappeared. The phone calls and the --
Gee I hope this doesn't make my cold any worse.
You asked me where I got that date with the dumper -- Frank sent me on it.
What did you expect? Frankie still has a good string, three girls. Figure three hundred a week from each.
About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?
Oh golly, oh just what I've always dreamed of, dirty phone calls.  How come?
Oh -- wait -- oh I get it. You said that just to keep me scared. So I'd tell you everything I -- oh clever; oh you smart, tricky hick.
Ezra, I'm lots better than you're used to. Tell me -- the other night, watching me with Mr. Faber -- wasn't your tongue a little bit hanging out?
The same as Jane McKenna.
Ligourin: How could you do it?
Please.
No.  Well all right. But you want to and I want you to and we both know it and all right.
I saw Mr. Faber.  You remember Mr. Faber, don't you?
Is that all you have to say?
Oh look what he did in them.
You wanted to, or you are?
Look -- yes. I mean thanks, but -- don't you think we better be realistic?
How can you not think so? You know the things I can do.
She wouldn't be reliable anyhow -- a narcotics addict.
All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann; where does that get you?
Where, how?
I'm flying back out to Pennsylvania Friday; I'll fill them in on things.
You said he was no possible connection with Tom. The Page girl told you that, not Tom.
You were hired to look for Tom.
I can talk it over; possibly I can get the money. When are you meeting the man?
It's a beautiful day in Tuscarora - I don't envy you that humidity in the city.
Would you like to know what's in it? The report.
Do they have the report? Have you discussed it with them?
OK and one of them  Jane McKenna -- she blows a little jealous of Bree - you know? -- Bree comes first? And evidently she knew the freak --- that he was a dumper -- she conned me into passing him to Bree, you know, so Bree'd get hurt. I didn't know. Till afterwards.
Sounds to me you better shake him again. Put him in a spot he has to do something more -- but this time give him a time and a place to do it.
The subject got emotionallv disturbed; he just dropped out. There's thousands.
Klute knew Tom. He has a great many ideas about the case --
Mr. Kramer?
What does?
What do you like best about your daddy?
He hits me on the planet Kriptarium, when I steal the buried treasure from the famous peanut butter factory.
When is mommy coming back?
You forgot the milk.
Will she pick me up after school?
Uh, huh...
Yeah?
Sure.  Too much birthday cake, right?
It's just...I've been catching a lot of flack at the office...
Objection.
Wow!
Is this really your desk?
Wow!  That's neat.   Can I sit in it?
Mom--I mean, dad?
At your mom's.  She'll have a bed for you in your own room.
Sustained.
No, counselor, I'm going to over- rule you on this line of questioning.
Did you wish to?
Tell me, Mrs. Kramer, are you employed at the present time?
Yes...Look, during the last five years we were married, I had...I was getting more and more...unhappy, more and more frustrated.  I needed to talk to somebody.  I needed to find out if it was me, if I was going crazy or what.  But every time I turned to Ted--my ex-husband, he couldn't handle it.  He became very...I don't know, very threatened.  I mean, when- ever I would bring up anything he would act like it was some kind of personal attack.  Anyway, we became more and more separate ...more and more isolated from one another.  Finally, I had no other choice, I had to leave. And because of my ex-husband's attitude--his unwillingness to deal with my feelings, I had come to have almost no self- esteem...  At the time I left, I sincerely believed that there was something wrong with me--that my son would be better off without me.  It was only when I got to California and started into therapy I began to realize I wasn't a terrible person.  And that just because I needed some creative and emotional outlet other than my child, that didn't make me unfit to be a mother.
Mr. Kramer, why did you set up residence in New York?
Objection.
Mrs. Kramer, how can you consider yourself a fit mother when you have been a failure at virtually every relationship you have undertaken as an adult?
And how did you find his work?
Ummm, hmmm... umm, hmmm...  Well, this looks very good.. Of course  ... you understand this is the worst time of the year to look for a job.
Mr. Kramer, nobody even thinks about leaving their job until after they get their Christmas bonus.
There might be something at J. Walter Thompson.  But...  ...I don't think they're really serious.  The position's been open for two months and...  They may just be on a fishing expedition.  I'm sure you'll be much happier if you wait until after the first--
In all that time did your husband ever strike you or abuse you physically in any way.
Would you describe your husband as an alcoholic?
A heavy drinker?
I don't recall.
How long was that?
I was not a failure.
I am not!  I'm a terrible mother! I'm an awful mother.  I yell at him all the time.  I have no patience.  No...No.  He's better off without me.  Ted, I've got to go...I've got to go.
He looks like a terrific kid.
He's already got one mother, he doesn't need two...He's yours...  I won't fight you for him any more. He's yours...
Wow!
Listen, don't let it get you down.  You're going to be fine.
Look, Ted, I'm the oldest whore on the beat, okay?  Three marriages, two divorces...You're gonna be okay.
Look, it's none of my business, so you can tell me to butt out, okay?  But if you want my advice, you'll send Billy away to stay with relatives for a while.  Just until you get yourself straightened out.
All right, Jim.  You said I was running this show, right? You said no decisions without my approval, right?  Well what the hell is this? What's going on, Jim?
Disappointing.  It only pulled a fourteen share and they were hoping for a twenty-five minimum, and...ah...they're not very happy and...Well, the guys have decided they want to...ah, re-think the entire concept and...Look, I don't like having to do this, okay?... But...I mean, what I mean is...ah, I'm going to have to...ah, let you go--
Yes.
You want to know why?  I'll tell you why...  Another scotch and soda for the gentleman.  I'll tell you exactly why. Because you're not his buddy anymore.  Because he can't count on you to sit around the office every night until eight or nine and shoot the shit with him.
So...what's so terrible about that?
So, naturally, you assume that since Joanna left, that would be a compelling point against her, right?
And?
Mr. O'Connor called.  There's a meeting with the Revlon people in the board room and you're fifteen minutes late.
Mr. Lombardo from packaging wants to meet on Friday.
Jesus Christ.  Did you have to be so rough on her?
Mr. Kramer, would you tell the court exactly why you want to retain custody of your child.
What if I fight it?
Mrs. Phillips, how long have you known Ted Kramer?
Ted?  They've set the court date. I just heard today...It's...  January sixth.
Mr. Kramer, there's--
I walk in the house and before I can say "How are you?", "Did you have a nice day?" before I can say anything.   Pow she's out the door.
Then how come she never said anything like that to me?
Y'know something Thelma--you are the typhoid Mary of divorce. I mean it.  Joanna and I never had any trouble until you and Charley split up.
I've got enough trouble raising my own kid.  I don't need another one.  Got it?
You ever think about getting married again?
How many onions does it say to use?
C'mon, Thel.  So Charley had a little fling.  So what? All in all he was a pretty good husband.
Ted.
Where will you keep them?
How much tea do you drink, Prime Minister?
And the United Nations? Surely?
I want at all costs to avoid this. Do we have news from the delegation in China?
Ngabo did not have the state seal. He could not sign.
Your Prime Ministers, support the proposal that you return to Lhasa. On the opposite hand, some officials urge you not to return. They believe you should leave now, for India.
This many?
You can't do anything real until you are Dalai Lama.
The war is over. This is a time in when nations are redefining themselves.
India is a newly independent nation. They are struggling. India is in no position to help us.
America, we shall see.
It is unlikely. America, perhaps. There is great anti-communist feeling in America.
The Chinese would see such a pact as an open declaration of war.
I ask them to stop, to lay down their guns.
Land reform is underway in Amdo. The large estates are being confiscated and redistributed. Landlords are being punished.
I have always asked for plain information. Just the truth.
They will take Lhasa next.
The crowd will not disperse until you give your assurance that you will not attend the Chinese festivities. Many who have been invited to dine with the Chinese do not return home.
Good day.
Of course, please, this way. Your servant may use the kitchen.
You know, I have great respect for your Lord Buddha. He was anti-caste. Anti-corruption. Anti-exploitation. For some, politics and religion can mix.
He does, a little spot where the butter had been.
What do you think?
Things change, Kundun.
I want to run down the street. I want to buy a toy. Eat from the shops.
Yes.
This is Tibet. And this is China.
The people want you made Dalai Lama.
You will not come?
Am I running away?
You, kill me?
Don't eat all those sweets. You'll get sick.
Taktra Rinpoche, I understand there was an attempt on your life.
You are unharmed?
I mean, my doubt. Why me? Am I Him?
Oh, my husband passed away almost two years ago.
And how would you have accomplished this, Ma'am?
Murders and rapes in the cities. People bomb planes... can the police stop them?  <u>No</u>.  But feed one little cow to a crocodile...
<u>Please</u>.  I'll have sex with you, anything, but get out of the water.
I brought a pork chop, maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck.
Sobek.  Half man, half croc, oldest God--
Where is he?!
Well, you can try talking them into that, if--
The more he thrashes, the better.
Where is he?
None of us actually <u>saw</u> anything.  I realize this Sir, but something flipped us over, I doubt very much it was a mink.
<u>Did</u> you want to be killed by it?
Excuse me?
I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, I sit here broken, a hollow sack--
Eh.  Fuck it.
Did you make anything of the tooth?
The Museum of Natural History doesn't send out investigators to--
If one could be out there... why does Fish And Game tell me it's impossible?
What are you doing?
Listen, uh... Hank and I think it best if you stay on shore.
It's too dangerous for--
You flew up here because your boss--
He thinks they're what?
They respond pretty quick.  I'll wait till you get down before I turn it on.
No.  U.S. Wildlife is on their way.
Like little children.  You okay?
Sorry.
<u>Ow</u>.  Shit.
I'm gonna get ticks.  I know it. They're drawn to me.  I got a thing about ticks.
Really--
Calm down.
He's mooing.
Y'know, if we didn't live in separate worlds and... 
Hank.  The little cannon you brought, get it.  Guard the shoreline.  Otherwise, we're done. We made the I.D., our job is finished.
Even if we <u>could</u> tranq him-- how would we get him on land.
I can't.  I'll get Hector!!
The lake was dead calm until up he came.  The tooth is in there.
What?
<u>What</u> <u>is</u> <u>that</u>?
We don't mean to invade your privacy but... was he ill, was he sick?
I told you.  Two days, we'd have to camp.
What?
With what?
<u>What</u>?  I don't even <u>know</u> the guy.
I'm sure this would offend you on principal but... could we keep in touch?
Kevin, as long as we...  What was that last part?
Hey.
This is business.  There was an accident in Maine, some guy got killed by something in a lake.  Probably a bear, but... they found a tooth.
Are you on drugs?
What do you expect, mugging me from behind?
I don't like to be scared, Myra, I have a thing about fright, don't ever scare me.
<u>You</u>?
Phone call, Clarice. It's God.
You missed Fourth Amendment law. Unlawful seizure, real juicy stuff. Where were you all afternoon?
Lecter said a lot of things.
What girl?
Dr. Chilton - if Lecter feels you're his enemy - as you've said - then maybe I'll have more luck by myself. What do you think?
Maybe he lives in this, this Belvedere, Ohio, too! Maybe he saw her every day, and killed her sort of spontaneously. Maybe he just meant to... give her a 7-Up and talk about the choir. But then -
Not to my knowledge. Privacy is a great concern to my customers. But, if you say this is an FBI matter...
Mr. Yow? Oh Mr. Yow...? It looks like somebody is sitting in this car.
Mr. Gordon, did you know Fredrica when she worked for Mrs. Lippman?
Now. I want your full attention, Starling. Are you listening to me?
Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter. Dr. Chilton at the asylum will go over the physical procedures used with him. Do not deviate from them, for any reason. You tell him nothing personal, Starling. Believe me, you don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head... Just do your job, but never forget what he is.
I've read your interim memo on Lecter. You sure you've left nothing out?
Do you recall my instructions to you, Starling? What were they?
Then do that, Starling. Do just exactly that.
Okay, Starling. Let's have it.
I don't know. I didn't see those on any of the other girls...
When we get back, I want you to run that bug by the Smithsonian, see if they can identify it. Maybe it's got some limited range, or it only breeds at certain times of year... You found it, Starling, you deserve the credit.
Lecter is still the key, I know he is. Whatever he told me about Bill is just as good now as it was before.
I lied to Lecter. I'll need some kind of peace offering... Can I get the drawings from his cell?
Sir, that's great news. But how -
Ever get out for cheeseburgers and beer? The amusing house wine...?
I am, yes.
Yes. That's the Duomo, seen from the Belvedere. Do you know Florence?
Oh, Officer Starling... do you think you can dissect me with this blunt little tool?
And the questionnaire...?
I might if I saw the case file. You could get that for me.
And have them clomping about in my life? Oh dear, no... At that time I still had certain private amusements of my own.  How did you feel when you saw him, Clarice? May I call you Clarice?
Punishment, you see. For Miggs. Just like that gospel program. When you leave, they'll turn the volume way up. Chilton does enjoy his petty torments.
Oh, a very naughty boy. Someone you and Jack Crawford are most anxious to meet.
Yes.
They all were.
She had an insect deliberately inserted in her throat. That hasn't been made public yet. We don't know what is means.
The death of my father.
No. Tell me why.
I went to live with my mother's cousin and her husband in Montana. They had a ranch.
Horses - and sheep...
I thought you might want your drawings back... Just until you get your view.
I think you were telling me the truth in Baltimore - or starting to. Tell me the rest now.
He kills w-
Thank you, Clarice.
Your lambs are still for now, Clarice, but not forever... You'll have to earn it again and again, this blessed silence. Because it's the plight that drives you, and the plight will never end.
I won't waste your time and Catherine's time bargaining for petty privileges. Clarice Starling and that awful Jack Crawford have wasted far too much already. I only pray they haven't doomed the poor girl... Let me help you now, and I'll trust you when it's all over.
What...?
My God, you've grown up.
You were acting for our benefit. And I apologize. I misunderstood you.
Much further?
They're going to hang you.  Why didn't you leave when you had the chance?
But the man is guilty of sedition and subject to military justice and beyond pardon.
You do not know what you are saying!
Cousin Eugenie, my father, but...
beyond the periphery of men, staring at him.
Yes. Go ahead.
Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our Mohawk allies.
I owe you gratitude or I'd call you out!
I don't understand!
Will you men help us stop the French?
That we did. John. But the horicane  is near trapped out.
I believe if they set aside their law as and when they wish, their law no longer has rightful authority over us. All they have over us is tyranny, then. And I'll stay here no longer.  No force on earth will keep me here... Anyone caught leavin' the fort could be shot. So each man make your own decision... Those who are goin', be back here in an hour.
So the Huron are the servants of the French?  To do what the French are shamed to do?
A man, here, can make a run straight through to Webb.
What happened to you?
I have lived to see two things I never expected.  An Englishman afraid to support a friend. And a Frenchman too honest to profit by that advantage.
Sir!
Shoulder arms!  Present! 
Sergeant Major!
Thank you, Sergeant Major. Thank the men.
Is the hatchet buried between the English and my French father?
Their arms?
My colors?
What do you want me to say? That it all sounds mysterious?
Dead?  This morning you said he had some skin disorder.
And?
Some say that's why we're basically hairless, for less water resistance, faster swimming speeds...
That it acquires intelligence from its victims?
Be careful with it.
It's got Hazy!
I thought they were your friends?
No, it's not going through. The intercom's busted.  I thought DeJesus fixed that?
That's why there's a dead one on the ship.  It ran out of blood.
I hit it.  But I can't see it!  Can you see it?!
That's an order!
You did good...
I need more light on that, Four.
You think I should hang around more with the crew?
I guess I figured if I was in their shoes that's what I would've done.
What are you doing?
The internal monitors read normal.
Shut up, all of you.
I'm going inside.
Give me a readout, DeJesus.
How do you feel, DeJesus?
...as long as you know it's not in your contract.
How's the weather for pickup tomorrow?
What're you saying?  That we're not even going to be picked up tomorrow?
But it's a delay!  How long? A day?  Two days?!
I'm telling you, it's the suits!
Yeah?  How'd the kid hold up?
What's going on?
Hey, Cobb...Man, why don't you take off your shirt and pants, man?  You should do that wearing what you're going to wear at the beach.
You're on your way somewhere all right...the looney bin.
Bad as he is there's no way we can make our quota with- out his sad self out there. You just can't do it.
Serves his ass right to get it.  Motherfucker brings that shit onboard.  I hope his fucking ass rots in the sea and is shit upon by the fish.
Look.  Water.
How far away is she?
Yes sir, ain't that where we usually go when we're sick?
I'm going to try to remove it.
Fuck semantics, Doc! You saying its like part DeJesus, part Sixpack, part Bowman?!
What is it?
How is he?
Cobb's cut...It was in him! It got Doc...
What is it?
What is it?
It saw us!
The latch is screwed up.  Or the hinge.
At the bottom of a bottle and has been for two days; it's hit him hard.
Because it's cheap like a budgie.
What's that?
Well whatever it is, could you get your man to turn the TV down?
Well you just better un-sell 'em, sharpish.
Inside, out-fuckin'-side. I don't give a shit, you get those guns because if you don't . . .
And JD is his dad, and owns the whole property?
Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.
I see, one of those `on a need to know' basis things, like a James Bond film, is it?
You all right back there, mate?
That should take care of that lot. We are now officially in the money- loaning business, all right, son?
What can I do for you?
Not likely I am afraid; I don't think I'll be seeing them again.
OK Gary, we call each other Kenny, all right?
I want you to search the house for bugs. I mean I want you to strip it.
There's one steel gate as you go in but they never lock it.
There's nothing to worry about, it's going to be easy.
Yeah, one of them's out.
Willy, this is the last time, and don't let him know that you're here, otherwise he will be here all day, and get rid of him quick. We have work to do.
J, what's going on out there?  Get the rifle out, Charles. We're being fucked.
Right, his leg's going now.
And all your friends, there's a good lad.
Invitations.
Are you sure you can afford twenty-five?
Well, what do you want us to do about it?
And we will just have to find out who's going to be carrying them.
That's it all done, we are off.
Tom?
You got it all?
I will.
Go on.
Hello, can I help you?
No, I'm afraid he's not. He's out at the moment.
Well, perhaps I can't, Plank, if you know what I mean.
I can't help you, Plank.
Sorry, got to do business like this now; can't be too careful these days.
How much did you say it was, Tom?
Bloody hell, Tom! This is a bit heavy. This is London, not the Lebanon' Who do you think I am?
Jesus, if I pick them up, will they stay in one piece? Where did you get them from?
Sawn-offs are out, Tom; people like to have a bit mare range nowadays.
My van is half full.
If you will order stuff that comes from Kat-Man-Fucking-Du don't be surprised if your fruit picks up a few tourists en route. ~ Never mind that, what about the money?
You would take a pain ín the arse full stop.
Chill, Winston, it's me and Charlie can see it's me, so what's the problem?
Joanie Orozco's telling the whole school she's like desperately in love with Santo Guerra.
Just 'cause I'm not like Little Miss Honor Roll here--
How do you think you're going to make a living?
You can fix old cars. Mr. Washburn told me that the cars they're making now are all computerized--
It's my life. If I want to fuck it up, that's my business.
You don't sound too enthusiastic.
Why don't you start with that?
If the incident happened the way you say it did, there hasn't been an infraction.
We're not running a dating service here.
Private Johnson!
You got a cause of death?
What I will do is keep names out of it till we got some answers or hit a dead end. You know how the press is with a murder story--even if it's forty years old.
Yeah, well--
Bunny, is that stuff I left in the garage still there?
You'll get official notification when I make my decision. He is out the door--Otis pulls himself a beer as Carolyn steps back out--
Come on in--
Men worked for Santa Anna down there, waited out the Civil War. The land wasn't much to feed people on, so in 1870 they come north and put up at Fort Duncan and the men joined up what was called the Seminole Negro Indian Scouts. Best trackers either side of the border. Bandits, rustlers, Texas rednecks, Kiowa, Comanche--
So how come you got into all this?
Big O was always there with a  smile or a loan or a free drink.
Yeah. He lives here, right?
Maybe we'll clean that thing out back up, have a barbecue next weekend. We could invite him and his wife over.
Right.
You finding lots of cactus and shit?
Since I've been stationed here? A fistfight now and then--
You met her family? They gonna be cool about you being a white guy?
Mikey--
This is the stuff we picked up the other day, right? The rest of this is all .30 caliber--
You spoil 'em, Cliff.
So where does that put us?
They stopped training infantry there in the late '50s. It was just a playground for the jackrabbits till they gave it to the county last year.
I was driving back from Apache Wells when they got me on the radio.
Right.
Reputation?
Vi a Rosaria arastrado para el corriente--[I saw Rosaria taken away by the current--]
Is very beautiful, your car.
This girl has a child?
Sam! I was just telling a few about your old man.
No.
Bledso
He still living?
And Buddy was one of them.
I got Eddie Richter at the Sentinel to kill that story.
He agreed it wasn't exactly news--
There was a mandate in the last election--
You made it pretty damn clear you thought he was nobody.
What? Become a nun? You didn't want me going out with Anglos--
He had the club out on the old trail road--
No. Is he sick?
Buddy was more a part of the big picture--county political machine, chamber of commerce, zoning board if I kept those people happy, he was pretty much on my side.  Whenever somebody thought--they start up another bar for the black  folks, they'd be--how should I put this? They'd be officially discouraged.
What?
How come?
You built our patio while you  were on the county?
I've heard Wade was a bit tough on the Mexicans--
I was on the playground with all the other kids, but I thought he was only looking at me. I was afraid he was going to arrest me--he had those eyes, you know--
It can happen so sudden, can't it? Being left out on your own.
We thought we were something, didn't we?
I look at my kids in school--tenth, eleventh graders. That's who we were. Children.
I mean what did we know about anything?
How come it feels the same?
How long have you lived here?
There's nothing on the walls. No pictures--
You gonna tell your mother we been seeing each other?
Any poop on the John Doe you found out there today?
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
You think we need a new jail?
We had about a dozen wets come over just upriver. They ran into one of our posts--it was like a breakshot on a pool table, illegals runnin' every which way.
One of Cleroe Payne's boys?
I sent your Daddy to the farm once.
You going to tell her?
It's supposed to be some big sin, even if you love each other.
I could have lost my fucking hands.
That's Butterfield...
Take a look at this.
You did.  Didn't you?
We've all of us waited too long to have the homecoming spoiled.
Please.
If you've lied to me to me --
If he was just a man like me, then no.  But he's not.
He's with us...
And are you afraid?
Yes.  They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while.  I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.
What's the connection?
Sorry.  You asked.
Will you take the job, Mr. D'Amour?
Harry.
Are they treating you okay?
Well... how about some of the other illusionists?
Just curious.  Back to business.  Ever heard of a man called Nix?  Dorothea?
What about Jennifer Desiderio?
He taught all this to Swann?
So Swann was performing magic. not illusions?  And what?  You thought he should be using it to cure cancer, not making millions.
What then?
Are you sure?
Yes.
Are you all right?
Don't look.
Is it finished?
It's better he's gone.  He would have done more harm than good.
What about me?
Sure.
I'm putting in a new illusion tonight.  Will you be there?
Tapert.  So, now I've got Tapert, Butterfield.
No.  I'm saying they were always fake.  The saints, the messiahs, they were just illusionists.
They weren't worth a damn.
You tell me.  No?  I thought you'd maybe have a theory.
With what?
Havanas.  You're not the smoker.  So who is?
What the fuck are you doing here?
What for?
Leave her alone --
Don't bother.
My God.
You're drawn to the dark side, over and over.  And it's drawn to you.  You don't like that.
That.
People are pretty cagey.  Who do you know?
Look, Ma, no wires.
I don't think so.  You need me alive.
You know, it's such a fucking waste.  You can do shit most of us can only dream about, and you go around pretending it's some trick.
Maybe he doesn't see it that way. Maybe he's digging his way out of the hole you put him right now.  That's what you're hiding away from, isn't it?
That's where we're all going.
One question.
Have we met before?
You could still help me do that.
Just get me out of here as soon as you can.
Hello?
Ok.
Try twenty-five.
What did you study?
Charlotte, who?
Really?
Did that help? Did you learn anything?
You are.
It's for my daughter.
Nice one.
What happened to your toe?
So, where'd you go today.
My stockings.
Lydia?
Lydia, I went to this great house tonight, this guy designed and built, you would have loved it.
I don't know... I want to be more healthy. I want to eat better.
Ok, well, travel safely. See you soon.
Its just a pseudonym, it doesn't matter.
You smell weird.
You don't have to be embarrassed.
Yeah, I know you have to work the whole time, I'll probably have more fun here. I'll call Charlie and those guys.
I miss you.
Lauren?
Oh, wait, can you hold on one sec?
You never said anything to me...
Weird.  The book again.  Sex spelled backwards...
I can't believe it's already starting to get dark so early.
Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?
Oh, Peter, you're going to pursue this.
Hey, what are you doing here in the middle of the day?
What?  That's horrible!
I'm gonna have to get a restraining order.  What a nightmare.
Honey, you're exhausted.  Do you want to lie down for a little while?
Listen to me, I love you, Peter, I'm trying to protect you!
You know, I made a reservation at Marco's for Peter's birthday dinner, but maybe you should cater it.
Mr. Kelson, what a pleasure to meet you. I have to say your instincts about the criminally insane are impeccable.  I am a fan.
Your court order, Dr. Allen.
Father Jeremy and Deacon John Townsend of St. Ursula's, and our associate, Maya Larkin.  Secular assistants are permitted if regarded as qualified.  Maya is eminently qualified.
Is he going to be okay?
Listen to me, Peter.  You can't let the ravings of a madman disturb you, okay?
So all that bullshit about God and faith.
...the ark sank, the sun set, the ark sank again.
What do you mean "don't worry?"
May I help you?
Yes... and you are?
I do.
I'll bet.
Where do you get off pretending to be my secretary?
What?!?!
So what?
When Townsend tried to kill me, he said something strange like...  "The time of transformation is near..."
What are you looking for exactly?
Nothing yet.
Are you alright?
What do you mean?
Close call.  For the first time in a long time, it's really hitting me. Life's tenuous.
What about after?
Plenty of time.
That's his, I don't know, his 'grounding' phrase for me, "together, no matter what."
How much time do we have?
Maya?  What do you mean?
You don't want to face it.
I'd appreciate it if you'd put that back.
But she worships you.  Your mother's dead but your father's alive.
Mr. Kelson, here's the stuff you wanted on pathological narcissism.
I plan to.  You want a tip?
As a part of today's story on the trial of mass murderer George Viznick, we welcome Peter Kelson, author of the current best-seller, VICIOUS INTENT. Thank you for joining us, Peter.
Meaning, Viznick's a man who answers to no one.  Not even God.
So, Viznick's got a meet with his lawyer in the ayem.
What's the matter with you?
Thanks for handling this.
We hauled her in earlier but didn't have anything hard to tie her to Townsend. Far as the priest goes, he won't be bothering you.  Suffered a complete mental breakdown, during - get this - during an exorcism.
Engaged.
That's not it.
Well, thanks again.  This was really nice of you.
Coach...
Careful.
Hello.
Nah.
You might be the only one with a job.
A horse?
That too tight?
Mom's going to hate it.
So what's going on with the Spring Dance? You have a date yet?
This brother from my college.
You do.
They ever love you back?
Hey, munchkin.
You were trying to make me look bad.
Way to hoop.
And?
So she's honest.
So who you going to the dance with, Spalding?
Didn't know you cared so much.
Yeah, the DJ's kinda whack, though.  So who is this clown?
Why?
When'd you get this?
Then prove her wrong.
That was so weak.
he's just playing, Q...
Who's nobody?
You want to go talk?
I just said I didn't fuck around.  But you got your head so far up your ass it took a cheap date for you to notice me.
You forgot to be there.
I thought a torn ACL was ten to twelve.
Funny.  I never did.
Wanted to give you props on making First Team All-American.  And then when Magic retired, I tried calling you again.
Actually, I don't...
Yeah.  Basketball just, isn't fun anymore.  You know?
You had a rough couple years, that's all.
You're serious.
I mean, Kyra hasn't heard the school thing yet.  She'll probably say it's the painkillers talking.
I'll play you.
So?
No.
I had some players to see and hands to shake.
You said you'd think about going back to get your degree.
The doctor'll be back in a minute.
Almost didn't recognize you with your hair like that.  How you been?
What?
You hearing me?
Where's your dad?
Guess I should have been telling your father.
Boy, what'd I tell you about using that word?
Why not?
Pop, there's no way an Ivy League Team is going all the way.
Yeah?  So you up for a game later?
What people?
So what are you gonna do?
Why?
What are you doing here?
So now you're saying my mother trapped you?
From your mouth.
And now I'm paying for it, right?  That what this is about?  "I told you so?"
What surery?
You ok?
You okay?  huh?  Jimmy?
Call 911, Mary, do it right now.
Hello?
Well can you connect me to someone else?
Uh-huh.
Well I'm not sure why you're calling me.
My mother had breast cancer.
It was scary though.
...what the fuck is this...?
What the fuck do you want?
Yeah, yeah right -- what the fuck are doing?  WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING IN MY HOUSE?
Please put your clothes on, please --
Your mother wants to hear from you --
Yes.
For what?
No.
ok.
got some coffee brewing, huh?
Yeah.
The gentleman who came to the door --
Many times, in damestic abuse situations the young lady is afraid to speak, but I have to tell you that, being a police officer, I've seen it happen: Young woman afraid to speak, next thing you know, I'm gettin' a call on the radio, I got a 422 --
It's where situations like these lead, Claudia, unless you do something about it early, if and when the police call and come for help.  Now there are certain measures you can take --
I don't wanna have to come back here in an hour and find that there's been another disturbance.
This is my job.
No. No.  Don't joke about that. That's not funny, Claudia.  Please, now.
Bye, bye, Claudia.
I'm sorry, Claudia.
Please, yes.
Yeah.
Great, bye.
You wanna make a deal with me?
What I just said...y'know, people afraid to say things....no guts to say the things that they...that are real or something...
-- no, no, it's fine. Fine.
I'm gonna run to the bathroom for a minute...maybe just --
Well.
I lost my gun after I left you today and I'm the laughing stock of a lot of people.  I wanted to tell you that. I wanted you to know...and it's on my mind and it makes me look like a fool and I feel like a fool and you asked that we should say things, that we should say what we're thinknig and not lie about things and I'll tell you that, this: that I lost my gun and I'm not a good cop...and I'm looked down at...and I know that....and I'm scared that once you find that out you might not like me.
I haven't been on a date since I was married and that was three years ago....and Claudia...whatever you wanna tell me, whatever you think might scare me, won't...and I will listen...I will be a good listener to you if that's what you want...and you know, you know...I won't judge you.... I can do that sometimes, I know, but I won't...I can...listen to you and you shouldn't be scared of scaring me off or anything that you might think I'll think or on and on and just say it and I'll listen to you....
It's ok.
Say what you want and you'll see --
You live alone?
I'm fine. Yes. I'm fine.
What?
DADDY! DAD! DAD WHAT THE HELL IS GOIN' ON?
GIVE US YOUR MONEY MAN.
GIVE US YOUR MONEY.
I have to talk to Frank, is he nearby?
I need you to interupt him, I need to get him on the phone with me right away --
I'm walking towards the elevator's, Janet.
You look like you've got money in your pocket.
Just throw some money around. Money, money, money.
No.  I mean, I'm telling you: I'm telling you that I have love.
That's right.
Things go round 'n round, don't they?
"If a brick weighs one pound plus one half brick -- how much does the brick weigh?" "Well if subtracting the half of brick from the whole brick you got one half of brick, equals one pound so therefore the brick equals two pounds --" "A little more than kin and less than kind," is Hamlet to Claudius. "The sins of the father laid upon the children," is Merchant of Venice but borrowed from Exodus 20:5 and "win her with gifts if she respects not words," is Two Gentleman from Verona. Where? Who? How and Why, Kids?
You mind your own bussines.
I paid you back.
Braces?
And how much is braces?
I'm listening.  I'm getting better.
How's today then?
Other fuckin' assholes like me.
...cocksucker....
...gimme that fuckin' phone...
Yeah.  You have the wrong number. There's no one named Frank here.
If you're up to it, I've got us set up in a suite upstairs --
I'm gonna start rolling --
-- see, I thought you grew up here in the valley --
I just realized this is for television, isn't it?  I can't swear up and down like I just did.
It's all important --
We talked earlier about your mother. And we talked about your father and his death. And I don't want to be challenging or defeatist here, but I have to ask and I would want to clarify something -- something that I understand --
No, this is about getting something right and claryfying one of your answers to an earlier question --
C'mon, Frank.  What are you doing?
Yeah.
Where are you from originally?
the valley?
Psychology major?
Ok.  That's why.  I had trouble locating your school records at Berkely and UCLA. Your name change -- they had no official enrollment --
Kind of.
Uh-huh.  What's going on?
Uh. huh.
There's no disturbance.
What does it look like?
You're here.
I said: I DON'T KNOW.  You can't just come in here and start pokin' around --
Ok. Marcie. Starting now I want you to have a new attitude with me.  The more you play games, the more suspicious I'm gonna become that you've been up to something.
No. No. Stay down, Marcie, sit back down on that couch --
This is the LAPD. If anyone is back here I want you to come out and I want you to show yourself to me with your hands in the air --
You look great.
Yeah. Yes.
Will you say my name?
Rose is on the phone and here's the cards for today --
I'm sorry.
How do we do this, then?
You're my handsome man.
How many times....it's ok...just say... Just say...
No.
What? No, Rose, jesus, no --
Why doesn't Claudia talk to you, Jimmy?
She thinks terrible things that somehow got in her head...that I might have done something.  She said that to me last time...when it was...ten years ago she walked out the door, "You touched me wrong..." "I know that." Some crazy thought in her, in her head...
Yes you do....you do and you won't say.
Yes you do.
Hello?
If we beat the record, you might get a call back --
You don't want any water?
Are you on drugs right now?
This is so over-the-top and fucked-up I can hardly stand it.
Shut the fuck up.
I've got Frank...Frank Earl's son. He's...he asked me to get him and I did --
Cats and Dogs out there, huh?
Pink Dot.
Partridge?
yeah.
Do you still want the peanut butter, bread and cigarettes ?
Total is $15.29.  Thirty minutes or less.
Let's go,let's go, let's go, you shoulda done that ten minutes ago --
Cmon,cmon,cmon, that one to?
I got an audition, I won't make it here 'till two, c'mon, I'll see you later. Love you.
Go to it, handsome.
I didn't I'm fine, I'm fine.
You have to be nicer to me, Dad.
What is that?
...fuck you mean, it's raining frogs?
....what the fuck, what the fuck....
Oh God I -- Forgive me...
My Queen...
I am preparing for a ball!
He is dead!  By God's choice!  There is nothing to discuss.
What do you propose to do?
What are they doing?
Prison was horrible but it was his home.  He's been torn from it by strangers.  He's frightened, exhausted -- and the mask is familiar.  Let him rest in it tonight, and remove it tomorrow.
Who is he, Aramis?
Then you are a fool -- a fool who has never lost a son.  What gives you the right to judge me, to play God with the lives of others?  Is it because you are so much holier than everyone else?!
Switch?!  That is your plan?  It is ludicrous!
Physical resemblance is but one small thing!  Louis has an arrogance, a manner --
And people close to him, who --
Phillippe -- he's very bright, he's perceptive, but he is in such turmoil --
Now.  You were saying?
Aramis, this will never --
Remember, Phillippe... nobility is born in the heart.
Please revel with me, Aramis, I need my spirits lifted.  I'm old, I'm weak, my strength is gone --
But -- doesn't God ordain both Pope and King?
Aramis!  Athos!  He looks exactly like... exactly like...
Athos, do you understand this?  He confuses me --
But what if something extraordinary happened?  Something so unusual that all the attention went to someone else?  Someone whose confirmation of Phillippe the King would never be questioned.
D'Artagnan, unready?
It worked!
Michelle cannot possibly accept!
Die?  What...?
Fromberge...?!  At the front?!  No.
D'Artagnan!
I have ordered a drill of the Royal Guard for midnight, and must be clear-headed for it.
This place... I once lived in a country house.  I had guardians -- an old man and woman.  And tutors. But no friends.  Then when I was twelve, they came and took me to the prison.
A man in black.  I never saw his face.  He took me to the cell.  A blacksmith came and they put me into the mask.  For days I shouted, "What have I done?  Why do you do this to me?"  But no one heard, so I just stopped shouting.
The plans for use of the maze were not disclosed to me.
Then you must allow me to stay close to you so that --
A personal nature?
Betrothed?  I think not.
Miss Beaufort has accepted our invitation.  By this we can only suppose that she wishes to come -- as we wish her to be here.
You dare criticize my father?!  Or lecture me?!
That is enough!  You are a good servant, d'Artagnan, but you forget your place!
Your Majesty...?
Not once have I ever asked anything for myself.  I ask now.  Forgive this man, this prisoner... your brother.
You've... memorized...?
I would not have disturbed you, Majesty, but you ordered me to keep you informed --
Did they kill him?
Majesty... We have more than enough food set aside for your birthday celebration next week.  If we distributed some of that, we would have time to gather more before --
Exactly why it should be given away.
I will order a Mass for his soul. It will guarantee his place in Heaven.
I'm sure if our departments cooperate we can find out the truth.
What did the six-toes have to say?
Let's roll -
Nineteen eighty four.  What fucking difference does it make?
Outside hacker?  What the fuck are you talking about?
Are you alright?
Yeah...the guy was psycho - I was just tying to protect the girl...
Hell, he probably raped her in the lot, dumped the body somewhere. That's what he was like - a real wacko.
I was just having a little fun -
Vice...you think they had something to do with this dead hooker?
Where is he?!!
Captain?
So where are you from?
You know, you don't seem afraid of much either.  How do you know I'm not going to try to rape you?
You always carry a gun with you?
What's going on here?
Look what are you anyway? Some kind of spy?
Didn't these - professionals - figure he had a girl in the room?
You are drunk.  You know, it's been a long time and I'd love to catch up, but I really got to -
Jesus, man...
Holy shit -
I've got a better idea...
OK...Marvosa makes calls to this fax number overseas.  And that's Switzerland's country code.
Who knows?  Maybe he's ordering army knives. I can't access that, but look what we have here...these are the account records for Fleming and Marvosa.
That was her - the girl... We have to go.
You must be going somewhere.
Where am I going?
I wouldn't presume to try.
Crawford has a proposition. I don't think it's a good idea.
The main thing is: how was Lecktor to reply.
How long do I have?
Aniline dyes in the inks in felt-tip pens -- which is what Lecktor has -- are transparent to infrared. The Tooth Fairy's ballpoint isn't...
The Chicago office is running through all the personal ads in the Tattler right now.
If there's any doubt, we matched the indents of the bitemark on the note against the Smithsonian teeth. This is your boy...  He folded the bottom part, including what Lecktor tore out. In this enlargement of the back side, oblique light revealed impressions.  We can make out: 'six-six-six'.  I didn't spot it until I had this high-contrast print. I advised Chicago as soon as I saw it.
'One hundred prayers' could be the page number. The paired numbers and the scriptural references could be line and letter. But what book?
Where?
This is Chester here. Who am I talking to?
Whatever I say, you'll take him away, won't you?
You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone?
How much do you know?
Blond, right-handed, really strong, wears a size eleven shoe. The prints are all smooth gloves. He's on a full moon cycle. Both times. His blood is AB Positive.
And I got you down here fixing fuckin' boat motors.
You look all right now.
Jack, this is Graham. Is Price still in Latent Prints?
How'd you know 'broken mirrors?' Bribe a cop?  Tell it to the U.S. Attorney, Lounds!
We know the Tooth Fairy reads the Tattler. The stuff about me and Lector? I don't know any other paper that carried it...
Can we still get Lecktor's message out of the paper?
Who is it?
Asian studies at Langley said the mark you found on the tree is a Chinese character considered a positive or a lucky sign in gambling. The character also appears on a mah- jongg piece.  It means Red Dragon.  That mean anything to you?
Milwaukee, Madison, Dubuque, Peoria, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Toledo and Detroit.
He's very careful, very... designed when he chooses.  If we find out how he finds them, then we'll find him.
Something Lecktor said.
No. It's Bob's Photo Store in...
It does, doesn't it?
Fogel has four more names. He knows two: both dark hair. Third's a woman. Fourth's a handicapped parking permit...
I'll cover the back.
Where the hell's Graham!
Come on in.  How about a gin and tonic?
That was nice of you to think of that.
Is that you. D?
The developing room.  I need to... see you.
I'll see you later. All right?
Who is it?
Am I alone in this room? Are you here...  Why are you doing this?!
It's Dragon. Dragon... Red Dragon.
No, Mr. Lounds. You'll be just fine.
What am I doing here?
According to you I'm a sexual failure. An animal, you said.  You know now, don't you?
Open your eyes, Mr. Lounds.
Look at the screen. That is William Blake's 'The Great Red Dragon and The Woman Clothed with the Sun.'  Do you see?
Do you see?
Do you see?
Are you a man?
Now you will read this into the tape recorder.
You will tell the truth?
Come in.
Do you have it?
I want to see Lecktor now.
It's Will Graham...
Can you read it to me?
He's right-handed.
He's very strong physically.
He's white and six feet tall. You haven't told me anything yet.
That's all we know about.  Most of the time in sex assaults the bite mark has a livid spot in the center. A suck mark. These don't. So, for him, biting may be a fighting pattern as much as sexual behavior.  You could try emergency room personnel, treatment for bite wounds. I know that's pretty thin...  He bites a lot.
The Commissioner was saying you were the one that caught Dr. Lecktor three years ago.  He killed nine people, didn't he?
You mended a crack in the wallpaper with your diploma.  You are open and easy now... It took you a lot of work to get to that...
What the hell can I do?
It's me. I'll call you tomorrow, sweetheart. Go back to sleep.  I love you...
You remember when we first met?  And were together alone in that room. And the exhilaration was too much to hold on to. And then something flickered across your face like a shadow and I asked you what was wrong?
Not too bad. I'll be here a few days longer.  I want to see you.
Did the girl die?
Did you get my card?
No it's not. Do you know how you did it Will?
It doesn't matter to me, Will.
In the papers. I don't tear out the articles.  I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid. You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you?
Pray tell.
What disadvantage?
Do you have the file with you
Let me have them, and I might consider it.
You have to do it.
Okay.  Fine, I'll do it.  But I have a few terms.
Andy?
How long would they let me sleep?
You're so proud.  You're like some retarded kid comin' home from school: "Look, Dad, I got an F!"
George... I'm at a stage where the audience expects me to constantly shock them.  But short of faking my death, or setting the theater on fire, I don't know what else to do.  'Cause I've always got to be one step ahead of them.
That means it was a success.  I woke up the audience -- like punk rock!  Here, take this.
They're having a laugh...
I can't move my arm.
So, Mr. Besserman, same slot tomorrow...?
But I've got a sports show. Championship wrestling, at five.
B-but... we saw... your neck...
Andy... uhh... this network has a long-standing policy: The viewer must be able to see the program.
Right...
Gosh, you scored!  Look at all those goodies!
Hey, I hope you didn't take that stuff I said seriously.  It was just part of the show!  It's like the old days, when a carnival barker would try to rile up the crowd.
Hi...
Ooo, the little lady's upset.  Well I say -- get back in the kitchen!
Is this an act -- or are you addicted to causing trouble??
Then stop treating me like a fucking prop.
How can you be so casual??!
You're NOT DYING!
You're not listening to me --
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
Each show is worse than the next.
So?  What do they know?
Give me the book.
You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler...
Sir, do you have a problem?
This is very difficult for me to say... but -- perhaps it would be best if you didn't attend the retreat.
Please!  You've GOT to let me take the classes!  It's how I keep myself BALANCED!!
No, I'm serious.  If you book Tony, do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY.
Yeah, I KNOW what I said!  But -- trust me, it's not gonna happen!
We had a deal!!
Can I help you with something?
Hey, that's good!  We can make that play.  And we'll really drag it out.  You get better, you get worse... you die...
It's a perfect Kaufman audience.
Is he in his room?
They are dead.  In either case --
The sewers.  Of course.
The great Morpheus.  We meet at last.
Smith.  I am Agent Smith.
He's gonna make it.
That's the third white van I've seen.
What?!
Hallelujah!  You are my savior, man! My own personal Jesus Christ!
You bet your ass.  It keeps him going.  Maybe it keeps all of us going.
There was an accident.  A fucking car accident.  All of a sudden. Boom.  Jesus, someone's going to make a believer out of me.
I got a fibrillation!
Hello?
Who's coming for me?
The Matrix is everywhere, it's all around us, here even in this room. You can see it out your window or on your television.  You feel it when you go to work, or go to church or pay your taxes.  It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.
Get some rest.  You're going to need it.
Do you know why you didn't make it?
Every attempt to fight them has ended in failure.  Only a handful of men and women have ever crossed an agent and lived because they are everyone and they are no one. Unkillable.  But now I believe that is going to change.
So is this the same oracle that made the, uh, prophecy?
How does she know?
And she's never wrong.
She helped you?
Morpheus, I don't think this is a good idea.
I told you I don't believe in this stuff.  No matter what she says I'm not going to believe it, so what's the point?
Did you believe in them too?
Tank.
How...?!
Yeah.
That vase.
So?  What do you think?  You think you're the One?
From what?
Neo, please, you have to trust me.
And I know that's not where you want to be.
Are you all right?
What happened?  What did you see?
What is it?
What happened?
No, you're not.
Zion?
Holy shit!
Goddamnit!  I don't believe this is happening!
Does it?  I don't know.  This can't be just coincidence.  It can't be! Can it?
Neo, this is loco.  They've got Morpheus in a military-controlled building.  Even if you somehow got inside, those are agents holding him.  Three of them!  I want Morpheus back, too, but what you are talking about is suicide.
There is.  We have to pull the plug.
Neo!
Well, I don't know if we want to buy all $40 worth...
Riverdale.
Well, we want good stuff.
Keep quiet about this.  I don't have any license for him yet.  I've only had him a couple of days. Nobody can feed him except me.  I'm the only one he trusts.  Watch.
'Art thou the King of the Jews'?
Get out of here before this really goes up.
Listen, I appreciate it, but I'll handle it myself.  I'll write.
Waddaya think?
Yes, you're gettin' it all over my tie.
You sick or what?  You forget what we had to do to get you on the trucks, stupid?
I won't wait until Tuesday.  I'll break your arms right now.
Hey...you got nothing here.
Let's get out of here.
That's what I get for getting involved.  Look, on pay-day at least show up at Tony's Place to meet him, ok?  This way he doesn't think that you're trying to screw him.  If you show good faith and save his face maybe we can talk and he'll take off the interest or make different payment arrangements or something... understand?  I'm not asking I'm telling you!!
Well kids...have the bans been announced yet?
Back so soon.
Listen, I should wrap up this place in a ribbon and hand it to him, you know that.  I don't need this aggravation.  I'm getting old.
Your Uncle's a good man...I won't stick him.  Either he gets the money or the place and right now he's getting the place.  And tell me why should I care?  I got a partner who's a bum, who doesn't help out...who disappears and leaves me with all the problems.  I should go back to Florida...I don't need this.
OK, ok...
No...I'll be ok for a week.
Look...I don't know.  What am I supposed to be, his keeper or something?  Yeah, he's supposed to be here but who knows what goes on in his head.  Right?
I know that Charlie but look at my side.  You undersigned the loans. You vouched for him.  What happens if this kid don't pay me?  I gotta collect from you?  I don't want to do that.  I made a deal with him not you, right?
Well, he isn't.  Nice...real nice.
Charlie, this is business.
You're really crazy.
You know Diane...I've been wanting to talk to you for a while now...er... a...  aside from all that joking around we do out there...when you're on...I... a...I really...think that you're a terrific performer...
No, I'm serious...You're really good.
Uncle, how are you feeling?
About Oscar...I think he put on this act...about the restaurant being in bad shape and all that. He can't make the payments...I don't know what to make of it.  He says Groppi's run off with a girl. I could help if you want.
Hey, where you been?
Well, maybe you missed something?
Nothing.
You know...like restaurants, night clubs...
The building on the corner.  That one!  He's been on the roof a half hour now!
Come on.
What'sa matter...forget your registration?
I know what you're going to say but don't say it.  These drinks are all on the tab.  I'm gonna see you this Tuesday payday, I promise.  I give you my word.
Just keep him quiet.
Daddy!  Come on, a name.
Just plain 'Joe'?
That was 'Joe'.
Isn't it enough to be on this earth sixty-five years without having to be reminded of it.
I know you do, darling.
Now, I'm getting interested.  I want to know more ---
Hi, Daddy, what do you think?
I wasn't going to say --
What about the Mayor?
Please don't be negative, Drew, we have an acceptance list that would do The White House proud -- The Secretary-General of the UN, the Chairman of the FCC, nine Senators, I don't know how many Congressmen, and at least twelve of the Fortune '500'.
...This shit's not bad.
Left field somewhere.  Well, Bill, I want to come in from the outfield, bat cleanup like you have, learn the plush ropes --
What are you eating.
I would prefer some peanut butter.
Incidentally, Joe, where're you staying?
Hot or cold.
I thought it was great, I thought you and Big John would be like a couple of bulls in a china shop --  Instead it was --
You're not familiar with the phrase, "In this world, nothing is certain but Death and Taxes"?
Shall we adjourn?
Sit down, Drew.
You're competitive soul, Drew. That's what makes you a great addi- tion to the money.  Joe is just... around.
Mind if I throw up?
I'm feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me.
Did you want to have a cup of coffee or something, Bill?
You're talking through your hat. You're offering a deal because you've got no proof.
I don't want to get rich this way -- I'm going to expose you.
What you then?
Don' be facety, woman.
No, I come to see Doctor.
She knows how she feel.
Jennifer.
The Board is waiting.
'Joe Black'.  Won fifteen and lost two for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1952.
How long you here, Joe?
Black.
Cirrhosis of the liver is the fifth leading killer of adult Western males.
You think so?  How do you know?
Do you think I should wait to tell him 'till after the party?
What are your intentions?  To make little dreams in coffee shops, turn a woman's head, and I don't mind admitting it was turned, I liked it, but ten hours later I feel like a fool.  I don't get it.  You, my father, here in this house, the cof- fee shop, it's making me upset, and I don't like being upset.  Who are you anyway?  And what are you eating?
You act like you never had peanut butter before --
-- What kind of childhood did you have?
I've got plenty of friends.
Yes --?
Joe --
Oh goodness, no.
I'm very concerned about the woman you attended to today.
Why?
Where are you going?
Thank you.
-- Could you?
Yes?
Well...I'm -- uh, Joe.  And you're Susan.  And I - uh - have this weak feeling in my knees --
He's taking a nap.
...No.
More than you love peanut butter?
Well -- I --
No worse than it gets for me.  I'm in love with a woman whom I don't want to leave.
We know so little about each other --
But there's so much to tell you --
Did I say that?
The 'coffee shop' --
Tell me you love me -- tell me you love me now --
Susan --
You think so?
When you go, I go.
How are you?  How're you feeling?
Sounds fair enough.
-- I don't deserve this.  I'm still young, this is not my time --
What's it like where I'm going?
Yes.
What I'm trying to say is this is a Board meeting and you are not a mem- ber of the Board.
-- What's the deal here?  Are you going to be breathing down my neck right 'til the very end?
Now I'd like to be alone.
Jennifer, give Mr. Black a map of the city.
You were just curious?
What 'okay' is, it's 'okay' it's over.  We've got bigger fish to fry, don't we, Joe?
I couldn't sleep.
Yes, I saw you see me.
'Spooning'?
Any universe that exists or ever existed.  You may be the pro, Joe. But I know who you are.  And you're all fucked up.
And I don't give a shit.
-- I have the feeling that, all in all, what I made this voyage for -- has served its purpose.
What the hell do you care?
You're what?
Those were my words, Bill.
Susan wants to come.  She says she's in love with me.
The Treasury Department asked my cooperation in his undercover investigation of John Bontecou. They were convinced that Bontecou, on past deals, had structured his mergers and acquisitions in sus- picious and complicated ways so as to evade paying the taxes he is liable for.  The IRS wanted to go after him, and this deal offered them the opportunity.  I agreed to cooperate.
Moreover, Agent Joe Black here -- of course that's not his real name -- smelled out your involvement, Drew.  He developed evidence you were working both sides of the fence.  Unfortunately, that's known as a conflict of interest --
Not exactly.
That's me.
Excuse me?  Could I say something?
'...I know, it's none of my business.'
Please.  Talk to me --
What is this, a joke, right?  Some kind of elaborate practical joke? At my 40th reunion, we delivered a casket to the Class president's hotel room and --
What the hell are you talking about?
The 'question' --
How're you doing--?
...I read you all the way on the Bontecou thing, and I know where you're coming from.  And I'm with you a hundred and one percent.
But I've got to tell you, if mergers are in the wild, I've got some great prospects I've developed.  I want to talk to you about them next week.
Joe knew the whole story.  I told him.  It was his idea that I come clean.  I mean I wanted to come clean but he gave me a pair of balls, you know what I mean?
Well, thank you, that's great, but it's more than I bargained for.  I just wanted to set the record straight.
I don't like to interfere.
Do you love Drew?
Forget about me and Mom -- are you going to marry him?
Well, it worries me.  I want you to get swept away.  I want you to levitate.  I want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish.
Aw, you're tough.
I won't.  And when I tell Drew about it, he won't either.
What is the nature of your interest in Joe?
What a night.
Are you relieved?
But what?
...It's kind of a pro bono job.
Sure, I'll give you the name of a doctor.  ...And I don't want to examine you.
21.
78.
You don't know?
No, let's go.
You know him?
How do I know he did that to you?
So I just take your word?
Something feels wrong. I think someone's fucking with me. Trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.
You decided to help me. Trust yourself. Trust your own judgment. You can question everything, you can never know anything for sure.
What happened?
Neither do I.
How?
What do you think I am?! I'm not gonna kill someone for money.
Calm down.
Yes.
* Depends on if he's here in town. Or if he's moved on. See, I've got all this -			*
You can stay here for a couple of days if it'll help.
There's a dress code?
I don't know. I'm sorry.
I can't make new memories. Everything			  * fades, nothing sticks. By the time we finish this conversation I won't remember how it started, and the next time I see you I won't know that I've ever met you before.
I'm not appealing the decision.
You've read it a hundred times.
Yeah, it's just this fucked-up building.		    * Why are we going there?
Yup?
Things change.
Who?
Why?
Discount Inn. Don't know what room; haven't got my key.
Why are you here?
I don't think so.
So what are you gonna do now?
Who the fuck are you?
Unfinished business.
What do you mean "bad news"?
Why?
What sort of questions?
Like what?
My wife's death. I used to work in Insurance, we were well covered.
Yes, I do. I don't have amnesia. I remember everything about myself up until the incident. I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Fran -
How do you know this?
What's wrong?
He knew about Sammy. Why would I tell him about Sammy?							  *
You won't remember!
You probably.							 *
No.  I was in Namibia...
...eliminated one.  SWAT's on the next two...
Just came in.  She's still alive.
Sure.
When?
The Keys?
Havana?  Cubans don't like us or my business...
I insist.
Good samba dancing...?
I forgot the napkins.
Do you have assets somewhere else? Bank accounts?
Sure.  As far away and as fast as you can.
And if I were in the Comoros, in the Indian Ocean, where would you be...?
What are you going to do with me? Are you taking me to jail?  You think I will turn into your informant, is that it?
José...
What...?
Client got delivery.  But there were..."extras" in the back of the truck.
Yeah?
What friend?
Aryan brothers are not going to change-up suppliers.  So...
So?
And specialize in very fast go-fast boats for coastal runs.
Like...?
Their loads are poly-drug.  "E" from Holland, methamphetamine precursors from Jordan, Afghan "H." Mid-ocean transshipments.  His real business is:  he's a network.
What's your take?
4-4-7 Charlie 12-92.
Guy's involved in a "meet"...
Who said, "go exploring"?  We want this staying on track.
You're so <u>not</u> the PD, if you got busted on a DUI, you're in serious trouble...you're bad men back to grammar school.  San Quentin.  Pelican Bay.  Marine Corps.  Statesville. Pelican Bay, where you guys hooked up.  Now you're too smart and too fast to get jacked again...
On the phone.
Where are you?
Oh, good...
C'mon, man!
You okay?
You sure?
...and we're looking at Nigerian crude...
Burnett?  They want 22% of the value on loads they run into South Florida.  It's the Juarez cartel model. They guarantee the loads.  The upside is our risk goes to zero. That frees-up capital.
Why?
I run down the numbers.  Nothing is very negotiable.  Small loads?  We pay three thousand a ki. We pay your fuel costs up front plus ten percent.  The next ten percent on U.S. landfall.
Conveyance?
Then what were we talking to you for?
I walk into Neptune's house...very nice.  But I also see you... and our drugs that got ripped from Maguda.
What...?
The Statue of Liberty.
What you gonna do back there, East?
Yeah?
Must be some mess back there.
Ain't gonna collect your pay?
Beat your butt, you don't lemme think!
That is one hell of a shirt. I bet you paid a pretty price for it, am I right?
For money.
I'm a hustler, hell, didn't you know that?
I think you just put your finger on it, I do.
You want some free medical advice, shut your goddam mouth about that night.
What for?
I drug in a cot, if you want to stay.
You want me to stay here tonight, is that the idea?
Miami Beach is the only place for a real hustler. Florida has more rich chicks per square yard than any resort spot in the world. They lie out in their pagodas and pergolas waiting to grab the first jockstrap that passes.
Well, I made it. This here is Ratso Rizzo and I...
Tell her, Ratso.
But thanks.  Hey, Joe, don't get sore about this or anything. You promise?
I'm scared.
What'll happen. I mean what they do to, you know, do with you -- if you can't -- ah, Christ!
Okay. Here it is. You gonna go see the doctor. I got nine bucks and twenty more Thursday and I gonna be riding high before you know it. So you gonna get you the best goddam doctor in this town and get yourself straightened out, that's what.
Well, just exactly what the hell you think you're gonna do? Die on me?
You know what's wrong with you? You got fevers. You kinky as a bedbug. How you gonna get to Florida?
These guys're good drivers.
If you have to shiver, why don't you pull the blanket up more?
Keep the goddam blanket on.
Hell, don't cry about it!
Thanks, Joe.
Sometimes it seems to me time stopped twenty years ago. There was this war, there was this handsome young man with quite black hair and he was supposed to die. But he didn't. Isn't that amusing?
What you got me up here for?
Listen, I gotta have money.
Ready for hard work, son?
The kids? Why are they...
Twenty months?
Tunnel?
Hey!  I'm getting this together man and I don't need no fucking Gastro-head along on this trip!  We go through the wall.
Anybody bitten?
Who?
No, don't let her!  I'll... How about Peg? Robbie?
Sixty Lira?
A cabdriver. He picked me up in the Pudding Shoppe in the bazaar.
Four planes in four days...but I guess you kids don't read the newspapers...and what with our people kicking up a shit storm 'bout the flow of heroin from Turkey you got...
...are you with the Consulate?
How's it feel?
And you?
There is no fair in Turkey, Billy. It's all "sula-bula" like this, like that. An Italian hippie had a car accident and a Turk was killed. SO, they threw him in here for six months...
But he was eating lunch a mile away when the Turk smashed into killed himself.
Best way is get your ass out... any... way... you can...
We go back.
'Dem dat hides can finds says I'... I seen him, the clever tit, sneaking looks at it late at night, talking to it.
But you fuck with me. You fuck with me all the time. You make crummy tea.  You rip us off on the hash.
Vilyum, I am Necdit Yesil.
Lawyers?
The blintzes!  "Try the blintzes..."
For Chrissakes.  You gonna lay a two- bit bureaucratic, territorial number on me?
We'll be back at the platform in...
Any luck?
He's special.
Just inner chambers...
He's out there. I heard him. How can he be? This things...
Who know?  We get lucky, maybe a couple of 'em'll be ours.
You know where they get this fertility stuff?  They extract it from the urine of menopausal Italian nuns.
Thought it was my week for that.
Ironic, don't you think?  These guys can hatch hundreds of offspring in a single clutch of eggs, right? And here we are...
Why take the chance?  Just let me go down there with you...
So, you're saying this is like those bugs that -- that look like twigs or leaves or...
Don't touch it.  And for Godsakes, try not to sweat.  They can sense chemical changes...
C'mon...
Talk to me.
Hello.
You guys have done a nice job.  How bout five dollars?
Siri, sandblast that thing. It looks like Trump Tower.  Those mounds are supposed to be made of dirt and excretions...
What's this?
It bit you.
God told me, since I was his number- one fan, that I should make up new stories as if I was Paul Sheldon. So, went to town. And I bought a typewriter. And paper to type on. The same kind Paul Sheldon used. And I turned the guest bedroom into a writing studio. Would you like to see it?
Well...  ...maybe it takes time to get the hang of it.
You want to read it?
What's it about?
The profanity bothers you?
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.
The one to town is, but that's about it. I called the hospital and talked to the head orthopedic surgeon. I told him who you were and what had happened. He said as long as there's no infection, you're not in any danger, and as soon as the road to the hospital is open, they'll send an ambulance for you.
I don't mean to pry, but I've read in two magazines now where you were seeing this model who does those disgusting jeans commercials. And I said it can't be true. Paul Sheldon would never waste his time with a trampy woman like that.
Thank you so much.
I thought it was time you two should meet. Paul, say hello to my favorite beast in all the world, my sow, Misery.
For a while I thought I might go crazy.
And look what I've got for you. An electric razor so you can shave yourself now.
Yes. It will be a book in my honor. For saving your life and nursing you back to health. I'll be the first one to read it.  Oh, Paul, you're going to make me the envy of the whole world...
I guess you don't get bothered by neighbors much.
Thank you for thinking of me.  Anything else I can get while I'm in town? Any other crucial requirements that need satisfying? Would you like a tiny tape recorder? Or maybe a handmade set of writing slippers?
Poor dear... Let's get you back in bed and I'll get them for you.
Well, is it fair? Should I keep going?
I've known from the very first book that Misery had to be born of nobility and I was right!
Oh, God, what have I done? I'm so sorry, Paul. I ruined your beautiful toast. Will you ever forgive me? Here, let me pour another one.  Can we pretend this never happened? To Misery?
Annie, what is it?
The book is almost finished. Your legs are getting better. Soon you'll be able to walk. You'll be wanting to leave.
That's very kind of you, but I'll bet it's not altogether true.
Now don't fuss, Paul.
This is so exciting. It's Windthorne, her first love, right?
Paul, this will be our legacy.
I was fooling, silly.  You need a cigarette, because you used to smoke but you quit except when you finish a book, and you just have one, and the match is to light it. And you need one glass of champagne.  Dome Pear-igg-non.
Virginia, when you're in this car, you're not my wife, you're my deputy.
Stop--stop right here.
You really think Sheldon's out there?
Here's the list of all Sheldon's credit charges. Nothing after the Silver Creek.  Any calls?
"There is a justice higher than that of man. I will be judged by Him."
They're hauling Misery into court.
I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.
Yes.
Answer me a couple things?
Has she been buying any odd things lately?
An old friend. I was rummaging through a closet and it was just sitting there. Like it was waiting for me.
Marcia, please.
And my contacts at Time and Newsweek tell me they're both raves. And don't laugh--for the first time, I think you've got a shot at some prizes.
I thought you'd be thrilled. You're being taken seriously.
Gee, Marcia, if I didn't know you better, I'd think you were suggesting I dredge up the worst horror of my life just so we could make a few bucks.
- pull the NO2 tank and dump it, it's potential evidence..
I thought you were going to dinner.
Afraid he's got no choice.  I believe I broke his jaw.
Not much luggage.
You're not interested in seeing how it looks.
See anything you like?
Sean, there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about... Isn't going to be easy for me to say.
A change of plans?
Oh, no, not at all.  Maybe just a bit.
Where?
Outrageous.  I won't let you take control of my company.
Nyah!
If you look at Hunt's operational history, he invariably favors misdirection and deception. For a start he won't go into Biocyte from the ground where he has to risk confrontation with security.
Ambrose obviously got these from Nekhorvich on the plane.
So Ambrose has Bellerophon and McCloy's got Chimera.
Billy.  I think we got a problem.  Nyah's on the wing.  Up early.  Billy, do you copy?
Range is two kay.
Say again. Sounds like you're saying 'she's in the building.'
What can we do' mate?
No.  You just looked as if you did.
Would you mind if I'm on top?
I wouldn't do that.
May I say something, no offence?  You look like a gigolo, you sound like a thief, you act like a cop - what the bloody hell do you have in mind?
Pull over and listen to me, will you? Just listen..
The only other spook I knew was a liar. Charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth.  He'd lie about his favorite color.  But then I reckon it's an occupational hazard.  All spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies.
Spoken like a spook..you ever afraid?
Not that it matter much but..I seem to recall you staying something like, 'I was hoping we could work together.'
And that's the only reason?
Look, I can't run your arrest in CNN, but I guarantee he's monitoring every law enforcement agency in the world, for what they might be saying about him, if nothing else - he's got the ability and, we assume, the desire to get you out of there.
Before you are.
You'll be fine.  I'm going to lose you.
Have you met them?
I want <i>you out of there.</i>
I want you out of Australia!  ..I don't know how much more plainly I can put it.
Are you okay?
When I couldn't find you, I had to replace you.  Sean Ambrose was the obvious choice. He double you, what?  Two, three times?
If that's what you're thinking Ambrose would have set up a bidding situation with any number of buyers before he got on the plane.  Locating him in time to stop something like that -
- good.  Then if you manage to get hold of Ambrose, and obtain what he's got, you've got -  - 8 hours 57 minutes and twenty-three seconds to destroy the largest remaining source of Chimera on earth.
Sorry, Ethan.  I don't quite know where to begin.  Any suggestions?
And the only other remaining sample was in the canister you recover from Ambrose.
I don't.  No exactly.
You keep staring at that watch as if your life depended on it, Doctor..
..not in time to save him.
..I'm fine..and you?
Ambrose just pulled the memory card out of the digital camera and put it into an envelope, put it in his inner left jacket pocket...
I kill Chimera at Biocyte and he's sitting on a cure without a disease.
Let's start from the inside out.
Fatigued, certainly.  But dead is a little extreme.  On the other hand, when me dear Gradski had your pulse and blood pressure he has less than ten hours to live.
You took it!  All of it!  And what if I need it?
<u>Think</u>, for Christ's sake, you guys are mired in detail, open your minds, it's gotta be staring us in the face!  What does Ethan Hunt <u>want</u>?!
But why tell us?
Is he serious?
I don't think you're in any position to give orders, do you?  Not while I'm holding this.
There was nobody on the bridge.
They're dead.  Jim's dead.
I'm so sorry.  Krieger was my call.  I've never worked with him.  I'm sorry, Ethan.
Okay...
Claire...Hey...
Claire.
We've lost enough agents for one night.
Yes.  I see your point.
Can I ask you something, Kittridge?
If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse?
This doesn't sound like the Luther Stickell I've heard of.  What'd they used to call you?  The Net Ranger?  Phineas Phreak?  The only man alive who actually hacked NATO Ghostcom.
It's hard to tell.  I'm gonna have to be close.
The official apology from the Justice Department, the VIP treatment, you know, the whole nine yards.
Here's to  you, Luther.   To being off the disavowed list.
Who are you and what are you doing here?
Ah, but, we're asking about you.
Why should I?
How will you make sure Job will be there?
Simple game.  Four players.  Exfil opens the pocket --  -- cyber ops lifts the wallet.
Zero body count.
IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WE'RE NOT OUT OF HERE YET?!
Higher.  Higher.
OK.  Taking Golitsyn's exit.  Jack, open the doors.
Ethan.  Heís out of pocket.
I'm willing to take the chance.
What problem?
How was Chicago?
You're going to use Walter?
He won't be back in a hurry?
- but you left before I could get there and I could check just so many places..
Tell me something Claire, that night in Prague, was it you or Jim that blew up the car and scattered Hannah all over town?
Look to your right, then back to me. There's a camera built right into the bridge.  Whatever you see it sees and transmits it back here.  Can you hear me?
Why don't you take a look?
That's what we do isn't it?
Whatís the problem.
Itís working.
I won't pay for nothing.
I don't wanna talk about it.
Rose, pass the wine.
You haven't said anything.
Here.  Ti amo. 
The guy died.
Johnny Cammareri.
Yeah.
It's temporary.
You're married.
You're my father.
Gimme the big knife! I'm gonna cut my throat!
You don't have to help me.
She was right to leave me.
You don't know nothing about it.
Stop it!
I was dead.
Loretta.
This time I was trying to do everything right.
You don't get along with anybody!
Last night never happened, you hear me? I'm gonna marry him anyway and last night never happened, and you and I are gonna take this to our coffins!
Hi.
So. Where are we sitting?
Beautiful. Sad. She died!
What do you want to do now?
It's really cold.
I'm freezing to death.
Ronny!
You've gotta get outta here.
What the hell are you talking about? We're engaged.
Bye, Aunt Rita.
Hi Loretta.
It's Johnny Cammareri.
Will you marry me?
I helped you buy it. It came with two pairs of pants. It's for luck, Johnny. When you propose marriage to a woman, you should kneel down.
What time is it?
How near is she to death?
Yeah.
There's one thing about this wedding I want you to do. Call this number. It's a business number. Ask for Ronny. Invite him to the wedding.
What?
Oh yeah. He's a sweet man. I wanna have a big church wedding, Ma. And a reception.
So we'll sell the house.
How's the mother?
Did he tell her?
Your hair's different.
Are you drunk?
Do you love him, Loretta?
I... a... slept with my fiancé's brother.
Don't make yourself sick.
Moving in?
So.
That's what I came to tell Loretta. There's been a miracle.
Loretta...
Because my mother was dying! But now she's not.
May I presume to ask you a question?
When I was twenty-seven years old, in Jersey City, I asked a woman to marry me. She had red hair. She smelled a jasmine. She wore black shoes with pointy white tips.
My lady friend has a personality disorder.
May I walk with you a ways?
I guess you can't invite me in?
I'm a little cold.
I'm freezing
Cosmo. Many years ago, when they told me you were marrying my sister, I was happy. When I told Rose I was marrying Rita, she was happy.
We didn't know what to think. You were so weird yesterday, and then this morning, we go to the bank and no bag.
I see.  Yes, of course.
Ah.  Yes, of course ... um ... err ...
What?  Ridden on a horse?
Where did you get the coconuts?
All right!  All right! ... No more, please.  We will find you a shrubbery ...
Thanks you, Knights Who Say Ni!  You are fair and just.  We will return with a shrubbery.
Then you shall die.
Now stand aside worthy adversary.
You're a liar.
I'll do you for that.
Come Here.
I'm invincible!
Please go and tell your master that we have been charged by God with a sacred quest,  and if he will give us food and shelter for this night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.
Are you sure he's got one?
And that, my lord, is how we know the Earth to be banana-shaped.
Who are you? TALL KNIGHT We are the Knights Who Say "Ni"!
Ni!
What with?
What?
Too late.
Je...sus Christ!
Oh, shut up.
... But all the decision of that officer ...
You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!
I'm averting my eyes, Lord.
Well?
... Um ... Yes ... no ... a bit ... yes... she has got a wart.
I think I'll go for a walk.
To seek the Grail!
Did you kill all those guards?
Listen, lad, I built this kingdom up from nothing.  All I had when I started was swamp ...  other kings said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same ... just to show 'em. It sank into the swamp.  So I built a another one ... that sank into the swamp.  I built another one ...  That fell over and THEN sank into the swamp ....  So I built another ... and that stayed up. ... And that's what your gonna get, lad: the most powerful kingdom in this island.
Rather what?
How?
We don't need to do anything, apart from just stop him entering the room.
If we ... er ... 
Until you, or anyone else ...
And make sure he doesn't leave.
Make sure he doesn't leave.
No, I want you to stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room until I get back.
Er ... +      You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?
Well, look er, I ...
Look, it's my duty as a knight to try and sample as much peril as I can.
Oh, let me go and have a bit of peril?
There's nothing wrong with ... that.
Er, That's ... That's enough music for a while, lads. It Looks as though like there's dirty work afoot.
How much?
She loved him.
Aye, but will they?
Aye, she may say that to you, but the woman can say what she wants.
Be careful who sees it.
Have you met Mr Lyle?  He's in sugar...?
I fear the influence he has on her. The man's word is not to be credited. He is an arriviste of the very lowest water.  She's having a bust cast of him.  In Nero Marquino marble.
I don't imagine you frequent the Republican Clubs.  But the fact that neither you nor I are members should not blind us to the significance of their existence.  The Tory Party has always been our party.
Tell her the Prince of Wales wishes to speak with her urgently about matters concerning the press.
Mama...
The order of seating at the Upper Servant's table is arranged personally by the Queen herself.
Checked and locked, sir.
Then we'll have to see what can be arranged.
No.
That can wait till the weekend.
If I find out that you had anything to do with this, I will have you sacked.
Don't think I can't persuade her.
Do you hunt?
Still, someone must attend you.  Your wife should not have let you out.
But yourself?  What about John Brown?
You will not be unaware of the threat now posed by Republicanism.
The threat.  I tell them, but they don't see it.
Your family sent cards.  It was much appreciated.
Mr Brown.
Prince Albert was going to build a bench here.  He thought it one of the best views in Osborne.
If Prince Albert were here today, he'd tell him a thing or two.
I am told so.
He has been attending at Balmoral for many years.
Having considered my position here at court, I have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of Your Majesty that I should resign.
I had foreseen that you would not. But Your Majesty should understand -- that my mind will not be changed in this.  I leave for Deeside --
Is that not enough?
I never thought to be bullied by you, Mr Disraeli.  You, I thought, understood a widow's grief.
Gossip counts.  Lord Aberdeen was right.  This country is not governed by wisdom but by talk.  Granted, it wouldn't take much to winkle the old girl out of mourning, but if public opinion is against her, then it doesn't do to appear too close.
A fine choice, sir.
Where did you find it by the way?
No.  You are mistaken.  Prince Albert, my husband, had typhoid fever.  I asked what was wrong with my son.
We stayed a little longer than expected with Mr and Mrs Grant.  It was most agreeable.
Who told them that?
Where is my son?
Then why are you not with him?
What is the matter with him?
Does that thing work?
What's the riddle?
The next half of the game takes place in ARCADE's brain, The City of Truth. It's urban scenarios, lots of metal and concrete. Screamer comes faster here.  On Level Four you can get a free life if you wait until the last possible second before exiting that world.  Gotta time it right though.
Dead?
If this is a joke, I'm not laughing.
Talk to me.
He thinks I'm "sublimating".
So take his car home.  Wait.  I'm sure he's up to something...
Nick...
Can you turn off the game?
See, men always do this.  "Quiet down, honey.  Chill out.  Take a Valium". I'm not a fucking idiot, Nick!  I DID NOT IMAGINE IT!!!
Well?
This is like a movie or something.  I mean, am I paranoid or what?
Maybe it is alive in a way...some sort of electronic intelligence.  It's like a computer virus that developed a personality or something.  It's self-replicating...it mimics life.
SLIP-STREAM.
What Alex is trying to say is that it "seems" like it's alive.
Go outside, get your car, and meet me out front with the engine running. And make it quick, okay?
I don't want anything to happen to you.  I care about you.
What the fuck is that?!
Christ...no time...
We can take the dunes down like a ski slope. Pretend you're on a snowboard.
Listen to me, Alex.  These counselor's don't know anything.  They're full of shit. If you don't fit the pattern of the perfect kid, they freak.
Which way?
We're glad you people could make it, and we're anxious to have you try out our new product.  We think it's going to be a big seller.  But you're the people that make it happen.  You're the market share everyone's tearing each other apart to get at.  It's your opinion that's going to make or break us.
Adam, this isn't like you. Please come to the office. There must be something we can do.
But I'm not broke.
It's been a very strange day.
Cynthia... that would not be a good idea.
So what's the problem?
Well, just stop for a little second and think about it. Will ya do that for me?
It will work out.
So, this is the last time I see you then unless I do bad?
Yes...what is it?
Unbelievable. Look... here.  I don't know what's going on. That's so much baloney. I've got enough cash for one night, okay?
Have many famous actors and actresses lived here? I was meaning to ask you that.
No, I don't.
Wow!
No, no. I'm on my way to my audition. Before I go I wanted to ask you if you could remember the man's name ... Aunt Ruthie's friend who helped put this together. It completely went out of my mind.
Thanks Coco. It'd be so embarrassing
A car ... a car accident.
Betty.
Well ... we'll leave her a note.
I think I've been hurt.
What do you mean? You're Rita.
Well...  what do you think about then? I mean...  well what do you think about?
That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive.
Okay... but just...just to see.
Okay.
There's nothing?
What's wrong with that?
"Stop! Just Stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before..."
I hope I'm back in a couple of hours. Don't drink all the coke. 
Don't stop!
Rita... I know what you're doing.
Yeah, sure. Look what happened to them.
To Denny's? I wasn't going to say anything, but why Denny's?
You feel it?
Sammy thinks the Caddy had stopped along the shoulder ... man up the road said he saw two cars drag racin'...then you got that blind corner.
Could be...any of those dead kids wearin' pearl earrings?
The one of 'em still alive?
Well he said...  you know in his way... you know what I mean? Besides the guy gettin' rolled up under the kids car which busted him up pretty bad, there was this little knife-like torn piece of metal, you know, off the car body, rolled out and slid up through this guy's neck and just kinda slit his aorta, you know, but they didn't find it right away, so the guy's losin' a lot of blood, you know, to the brain - all this time cause it was just like this thin little puncture wound on the surface of his neck that kinda sealed itself, he said, while inside the aorta is bleedin' pretty steady all that time. So, Dr. Scott's laughin' you know like he does 'cause he knows we want to talk to this guy. He's laughin' you know and shakin'... Son of a bitch couldn't stop laughin'... It was kinda contagious 'cause pretty soon we were all laughin'...the nurse was laughin'. You know how he is.
Nope, not yet. Their fingerprints don't match up anywhere.
Not here...no thanks.
No ... thanks though... I'll take a cigarette if you have one.
That's it folks for the Demon Boat Ride.... Everybody off. Watch your hands and feet.
You took an awful big risk back there.
So you're telling me you were set up ? I knew something was wrong.
Just remember, hold your breath as long as you can. Then go right over to that corner. The door will open and go in and up.
If we can get to through the next room, we'll be at a junction for a power grid.
Where are we going ?
Just stop it. End it here.
That's very funny, sir. You are under arrest.
OUCH !!! GODDAMMIT that hurts !!!!
Okay, NOW I'm worried. What exactly is on the other side of the door ?
Is it over ?
Hey, try swimming. It works.
I didn't think he'd make it past Scraps.
Don't eat at the console.
Trust is earned not given away.
What's wrong ?
Parking tickets ? That's it ?
You think I'm that easy, Bitch ?
Excuse me, sir ?
Relax, son. They'll learn in time that you don't fuck with First Bank. This is the real deal and we aim to keep it strong. My Daddy always told me that Only The Strong Survive.
That was rather.... disappointing.
I want more action. I want to see more ingenuity than that. I want to see the injured man out wit the machines !
I don't believe Ol' Bruce is having as much fun with this as he once did. He still insists on the "guests" being of the more nefarious type.
What if we were to put Bruce into the Park as a Guest ?
I'll bet that would be the Park run of the century !
Yes sir. It will be the best of your collection, I assure you.
He has a phone pole sticking in his chest, I think we don't need an autopsy.
Only that you were one of the finest hit men in the mob. That if you wanted a good clean kill, that Johnny Tortelli was the man for the job.
I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't you trying to play both sides ?
No. I am not a homosexual.
Bruce has just awaken.
Will he make it out ?
I've got five bucks that says someone dies here and now.
Maybe you should get over fears.
Ach ! How will you know if they've made it ?
So what's next ? No one's ever made it this far before.
Come on, I'm serious. Look at Wilma. She's this frail little thing, and Fred, I mean Fred Flintstone is this BIG guy. He has to be hung like a horse, and THAT's why Wilma puts up with his B.S.
Well, I make good investments, I lead a double life as a secret agent.. I....I ... I have very rich parents. I have always had a lot of money.
Hey, you ! What the hell is going on ?
I'm talking to you asshole !
You don't have to sound so emphatic.
Hey Matty, don't wait for me or anything.
No, idiot. Where do we go now ?
Good morning.
My mother took this course with you at UCLA...&quot;The Foundations of Poetic Thought&quot;.
How did you know my name?
This is California, anything is possible.
THANK YOU.
She was the uhh...first girl ever suspended for smoking.
Do what?
You want me to move?
You're passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling, you've gotta have an angle.
Dad, when a boy likes you, does he pretend that he doesn't like you? And if he pretends that he doesn't like you how can you tell that he likes you?
Hello? Sultenfuss Parlor.
Hi honey.
Hey you're not eating your meatloaf.
I don't know if I want to.
Are you the Hillary Mitchell who went to school with Maggie Muldovan?
It's okay really, I was just a baby.
Umm...can you come in for a minute?
We have this school assignment to write about someone we never met and I chose my mother. She was born in Los Angeles and since my uncle Phil moved out here I came in to visit him and then I looked at her high school yearbook and...  and I called a few people and one guy said that she went to UCLA, another guy said that I should call Hillary Mitchell so....
I told you it was a long story.
And she saved it.
That's okay.
I know that.
My mother can't have any more kids.
What are you staring at?
What's the matter?
Likes me? He said I looked like a grasshopper.
Oh please, who do you think you're kidding? And where did she spy on the Russians from, here in Pennsylvania??
Thanks
Don't wake up Vada.
I don't need you to be telling me to...
I didn't ask for the money, Phil just gave it to me.
You ratted on my mother??
Care for a smoke?
Just call us the &quot;dead end kids&quot;.
Boy, you're really into this.
If he has a heart attack you're carrying the body down yourself.
Look at it this way, however bad I feel, it isn't as bad as becoming extinct in a bottomless pit of tar.
Do you think your friend's up in Heaven now, looking down on you and watching you all the time?
Hey relax, I'm not gonna break it.
That's 'cause I was cursed with the Sultenfuss Bear Claws.  My hands fit.
Right.
No, but sometimes he drives a hearse.
And I'm gonna use the movies when I give my report. Jeffrey says audiences love special effects.
Well Rose was being very thorough.
Vada!! Vada runs and jumps into Phil's arms Look at you, oh hi, hi, hi!! How are you? You look great, how's Shelly? Your dad?
I should do this myself.
I think this place is just fine.
I'm just tired.
Shelly's sick...I have to get to the bottom of this whole thing and get back there.
I mean...with your car.
Excuse me?
Something wrong?
Well I'm sort of involved.
Margaret's my middle name, but everybody called her Maggie. Los Angeles, have you ever been there?
Why not now?
Shelly?
Do you know him?
Hey, you didn't pay me!
You're such a baby.
Uhh, it's nice to meet ya. Uhh, we got burgers and hot dogs here if you'd care to join us?
Okay, I know you've suffered a terrible loss, and there's really nothing anyone can do to comfort you, but I urge you to focus on the times you had with the camper, the trips you took, the sights you saw, those days are gone now, but they'll live on in your heart forever.
Keep your voice down!
Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to your house today?
Can't you see it?
Stiffs??
I need the job.
Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal.
Well the other night at dinner...
Harry, I really think she.....
Hi.
Kinda like men.
Would you like to come in and see my house? Just for a minute.
What are you wearing?
You know this is gonna be my first 4th of July picnic in a long time.
Danny that's a real _bonehead_ thing to say!
Well, you were pretty great!
Daddy, can I have thirty five dollars?
Shelly thinks I'd be a good writer.
The money?
Well Shelly's coming over, we're gonna go together.
HEY, OUCH, damn it!! Vada, watch what you're doing.
Dad, didn't you say you needed prunes REAL bad?
In the garage.
Harry, I'm serious, trust me Harry this woman's lifting us in, you gotta treat her like every Tom Dick and Harry.
Oh she's picking you up, good you're on the right track.
Harry Harry Harry Harry Harry, I told you to use fewer briquettes and now look what you've done. You've cremated them.
Mademoiselle Sultenfuss and the amazing Dr. J! How's the summer treating you?
How are you gonna get the money for this old house if you're not working?
Cause she's dying.
Cause she gets scared of all those dead people in her house, and you know that saying, If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, well if she's one of them, she won't be as scared.
Does he love her?
I don't think that that roller coaster agreed with your bad stomach. You know Vada you have to watch what you eat here, I remember one time I went to a carnival with my cousins David and Frank, and they both ate hot dogs, and the next day they came down with nephritis.
I won, I won!!!
Daddy??!?!?!
I'm hemorrhaging.
Wow, this is the coolest thing, like you really eat and sleep here?
Well, I guess you found my secret hiding place.
Hey look at this, no feet!
I don't wanna talk to a teacher, it's summer!
No, I'm going home.
It doesn't work, it always stays black. 
Big deal, I can do that too.  Thomas J, you got something!
Naah, I don't wanna.
If I do it, can we go?
Hey look at this!
Is that your Dad?
Hey Vada, guess what we got?
What do you want it for anyway?
Get up!?
I'm hungry, I can't last any longer.
I have to anyway, my mom will be worried.
I dunno..
Have you ever kissed anyone?
Close your eyes.
Seeya tomorrow.
What?
Long trip.  Pretty nice of you to come.
Stay, huh?
See the pull of a book like Twenty Chefs, is not who I put in.  It's who I leave out.
Whenever George tells someone how steadfast I am, he always makes me sound boring.
He can't do that to me!
We'll never be the same.
There are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years...
Zit cream?
I give.
I'll think about it.  I'm okay.
My heart's in my throat, here. Right off, I have to ask this monstrous favor...
Excuse me?
You're enshrined in his heart and memory.  Unassailable. Which works out great.
But he always says...
Uh, Kimmy...?
Look at all this beautiful food, so lovingly prepared...
Who?  The jerk who's running your life?
Ex-cuse me?
I thought Michael was picking me up.
I haven't caused... a problem, have I?
Well, you're a little early...
And she's all wrong for me!
How can you trust someone you can never mistrust?
Gimme like, eight and nine off the top ten list...
Last zoo we were in was... Beijing, yeah?  Sure.  The rhinos were fucking.
You miss her, huh?
Don't you throw up on boat?
I've been thinking a lot the last couple days.  About us, actually.
It's no big deal, she just gave you the wrong keys that's s...
Michael...
Thank God you were here.
What's up?
I'm so glad you didn't jump on that train, before...
Why would she come here...
Almost three.
Well, the school will be here. Architecture will still be around. Right now...
Because I could come...
It's not just a gag, huh?
It would only be, maybe, six months? Or three or four? It would mean so much to him...
And yet here you are.  All celibate and reclusive.
No.
Barnett, please -
I said, I've been real tired.
What did you say your name was?
Well, Bye, Bye now. We have to go.
Well, that's not entirely true, Barnett. At least not according to Haven.
How is she?
He's lining up talent for Hal Phillip Walker.
He has that sign with the tree.
Well, how about the shopping center?
What's he running for?
D.C.?  Tammany Hall?  He came there?
You're kidding.
Hey!
Listen, we're suppose to sing on TV day after tomorrow. At the park...
He saw us at Tammany Hall.
You bet.
He got killed at a turkey shoot.
HI. Look at those flowers. Did you grow those.
Mr. Green?
Didn't you get?... How are you?
You want me to wait?
Uh huh.
How do you know?
I mean, Mr. Green was so nice to me. He took me in and...
Have you seen a woman about so high?
We don't mess with accessories.
Mom?
I feel really good.
I'm in a rooming house with Mr. Green.
Weather's been awful. All those bombs dropping. It changes our weather. Sure not like the good old days.
Bye.
And before?
Are you a close friend of Haven's?
Hello.
I knew when I first met you.
How old are you?
Thirty?
Terrific!  Who was that black guy? A friend of yours?
Hello.
Yes.
It's me. What is it?
I can only give you fifty a week here and ten bucks for the benefit.
Well, there's a couple of girls in Printers Alley if you got any questions. I know I've seen that G- string stuff for sale someplace around.
What National TV...?
Sorry I'm late.
Not yet. Listen, Norman, I want...
You know Bill is really mad at you.
Oh --
Ah... Peter Finch.
Oh, you meet them at parties and stuff.
You want a ride into town?
Oh, why thank you.
Now this is to raise funds for someone who can help people who are less fortunate than yourself. The more you take off, you see, more money we can raise.
When you study the martial arts, they give out belts that come in different colors to signify what level you're at in your training. Am I correct on that point?
Jeet Kune Do...Now I did some research on that form of fighting, and I found out that Jeet Kune Do was a style developed by Bruce Lee. Did you know that?
Thank you. Grace, there is one other thing...
Mallory, what did you think of Mickey's plan? Did you think it would work?
Hasn't it?
I take it by your answer it was a whole new team?
So can we. So the solution to our little problem is we had them deemed crazy. And we're shippin' 'em to Nystrom Asylum for the criminally insane.
Who's the song bird?
...one night I was asleep, and a noise wakes me up. I thought, 'Oh shit, somebody's broken in.' I didn't own a gun, so I go into the living room with a fucking umbrella. Okay, it turned out to be nothing. God made the noise. Who knows?
Yeah.
Do you have a back up.
What I'd like to do---
Not to anybody. She sings.
Sorry about that.
Of course, I miss Mallory. She's my wife. I haven't seen her in a long time. What a stupid question.
Was what worth it?
Do you think up these questions or the girl with no tongue?
Was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie? Yeah, it was.
You just said an instant of purity was preferrable to a lifetime lie. I don't understand. What's so pure about forty-eight dead bodies?
Okay...okay...I'll buy that. We'll move on and come back later.
Don't play dumb with me, Mickey. You know what I mean. Describe Mallory.  What's up here?  What's in here?
Everybody thought I'd gone crazy. The cops, my mom, everybody. But you see, they all missed the point of the story. I wasn't crazy. But when I was holding the shotgun, it all became clear. I realized for the first time my one true calling in life. I'm a natural born killer.
You guys wanna hear a joke I heard?
Donut, get your camera. See if it's broke.
Where's it parked?
If they stay, they'll catch you, and they don't have to catch you---
Yeah baby.
And they made the first move?
Hypnotizing.
He had the edge. The mind's edge.
And then Mallory stops Mickey and says, 'Hey, these are the Brothers Hun.'
Apparently, they've seen all our films.
Here's the layout of the laundry room.
What do you think, Pitney? How much Explosives do you think that they really have in there?
Pleased to meet ya, Jack. I read your book. I'm impressed. Good work on Curtis Fox.
And where do you keep Mickey?
Yeah, we met. They're good men.
Jack, could you stay up here for a while?
Okay, boys, let's have it.
Rollin'...and speed!
Camera jam! I'm sorry Wayne. God.
It's gonna be beautiful.
I see.
Ya know, I was.
Oh, that 'Dukes of Hazzard' show, there was probably ninety-five people there, maybe more.
Two guys?
Three.
Chill out, Phill. Four deputies and you, I can live with that. We're about ready to go here, so let's get rid of these other assholes.
Could we go with you and film it?
Give her a beer.
You gonna buy me a beer, Frankie?
That's no way to talk, boy. Now we had one of them union men 'round here coupla years ago. Stirred up a lot of trouble. They're always after you colored boys.
Well, she never gave me none. Look, you better find him a place pretty quick.
Looks like you're doin' a good job.
You know, man, that guy was trying to be friendly.
Like hell. You know, if you fellows stuck together 'stead of letting them walk all over you, they might not try it.
Been over to the other mill?
It's just that we're not used to seein' anyone stand up 'round here. Kinda took us by surprise.
That's two bucks, Joe.
Oh yeah?
I'm a teacher.
Yes, aren't you?
Why d'you come out with me? You slummin' or something?
They must work on the section gang.
I mean, you're kind of cut off, aren't you?
Well, let's see now - not counting tonight ... must be about twenty-eight times.
You got more guts than me, baby. It's a no-good town.
Ain't your fault.
Sorry, baby. I'm goin' to Birmingham.
Yeah. Well, I do.
What happened, Duff?
I can see why.
Everything you cook is good.
Hmmm - good coffee.
Ain't that something?!  That's just fine, baby.
Yeah. But just how're we goin' to make out? I got to get me a job.
I'm trying to help, Duff.
I could work even after the baby comes. A few hours a week, anyway.
No point fixin' it!
A whole lot, Frankie.
See you, Duff.
I'm Duff.
Couldn't get the words out before.
That's the trouble with you boys! Don't listen when a man tells you something.
Don't do her no good to get banged like that.
How often is that?
Come back some other time, will you?
Well, what're you going to do?
Maybe I could talk to Bud Ellis. He might have a job for you at his filling station.
Why don't you guys buy your own?
I'll be a monkey's kid sister! What d'you want to do a thing like that for?
Yeah. All a colored woman wants is your money.
Well, I got married to one of them.
Baby - want you to meet Duff.
He's your son.
I want my wife.  I told you and told you. Now I'm gettin' tired of this shit--
Whoa.  No way.  You can't enter the kill zone.
Security breach. Perhaps her friends have come to join our party.
You're hurt...
I'm getting used to it. Where are we?
What the hell is that?
Alright. Let's talk business.
Your gun, your prints. The Tessiers might overlook a little child molesting, but murder's bad P.R., Mr. Riviera. I suggest to reconsider my offer.
Then you'll have to persuade her to tell it to you.
Our analysis of the London stock crash suggest that it was manipulated from within the international computer matrix. Cyberspace, Mr. Case... A realm I believe you're familiar with.
You're a substance abuser, Case. Your pancreas was shot. Wouldn't have lasted out the year. We did you a favour and liberated you from a dangerous dependency in the bargain.
First sign of free will, Sense/Net usually slags 'em.
Anything rated higher than a P.C.'s got a hard-wired suicide switch. It'll self- destruct.
Working with a dead man. Shit, I've done about everything else.
Sorry, bullshit. We haven't even begun and you're already jeopardising this operation.
What's this?
Really? Do I get to know where I'm going? It makes packing so much easier.
That's nice, but we can't dodge this kind of heat for long.
Honesty. Almost as quaint a notion as your concept of good and evil.
What's inside me, Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me?
I saw your girl yesterday.
Jesus Christ, Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura.
Sure, Kid. It's a firmware construct.
So be it, we cross into Babylon like a cool breeze.
We're doing fine. Take the next right.
Case, mon, you just tell me who not to kill.
Ready?
What you're telling me is that I'm dead. Right?
I can't feel nothing because I am nothing.  Just playback. A ghost in the machine.
I duped these prints off him. Can you run an I.D.?
That A.I. of your's got the whole matrix hummin'. Sticks out like a spider in a web.
Bright enough to be dangerous.
Getting fried ain't going to get it any smarter. What we got here is one mad dog schizo A.I.. Armitage is right about one thing, Bro. If we don't shut this mother down soon, nothing will be safe from it.
Where the hell have you been?
It'll flatline your ass.
Take a look. Son of a bitch won't feel a thing until it's too late.
How much time you got left?
You're late.
You haven't got it?
What about the mainframe's access code?
Why did you come here tonight, Linda?
Excellent. That's exactly what I had in mind. But if you're going to kill me, we have to work together, old son. I'm no pushover, you know.
His name's Armitage. He's very anxious to meet you.
What about before that?
Then you don't really know who he is, do you?
You've been calling her name.
Not anymore. You got a new pancreas. Armitage's got you kinked so you can't get stoned.
Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him.
The first fun's bound to be rough. It that read out fluctuates more than ten points... just pull this out. But if the EEG flatlines, don't touch anything.
Case... Are you alright?
You scared the shit out of me, man. You were dead for fifteen seconds. Totally flatlined.
Who?
When it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase.
I'm going to be so happy to get to college. I hear at Northwestern they don't make fun of you for knowing the element table.
Hey, where's your sweatshirt?
What?
Oh, man! Who told?
Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation.
Now look. Let's focus. Prom theme. We need a new idea.
Who told!
I'm concentrating on my career right now.
Okay, just so I'm clear here -- neither of you think I can do this.
Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.
What is this?
He is totally crunching on you.
You don't think I can grab bulls' balls?
Gus?
Not yet. Every person in this office comes in here and watches you guys! It's like the goddamn Young and the Restless! Rigfort's salivating over it.
Yes you are. A guy. Guy. Quite a guy. Oh my. Look at that--I rhymed.  Yikes.  Bikes!
Oh.
You know, Adele penguins pick one mate. They spend their whole life looking for that one other penguin and when they find it, they know. That's the penguin they stay with for the rest of their lives.
Hey Rob, what's going on?
This--this is a luau that sells packing material!
It's just for a couple of months.
Are mom and dad here?
No, I mean, no big whoop.
Are you crazy?! You can't do this.
Yes. Exactly. Major Rufus.
Rob--thanks. For everything. This is really happening. I never thought--
Josie, finally. I just wanted to come over and make sure you're okay.
No- not really, Josie. NOT REALLY. How could you do that to me?  I helped you. I got you everything you wanted. And how do you repay me- you blow everything TWO DAYS before pro scouts come to see me play. Once they had seen me really play- they wouldn't have given a shit about my age.
Hi, everyone.  I don t think we've met. I'm Sam Coulson- although for some reason the school has this thing about not letting you guys call me Sam.
Whoa. Deja Vu.
Dorothy Parker--
Josie you owe it to yourself to go. For your writing. You're a natural.
Are you--scared?
You have to say that. You're my student.
I don't know. And you know what's scary--when you get older it just gets more confusing. I've spent the last ten years with women who are basically all wrong for me.  You know what, I shouldn't be talking about this stuff with you.
Thanks, Josie. This wasn't as bad as I thought.
You're really doing a great job here, Josie. I like your "can do" attitude.
That's sad, isn't it? He had to sit on that wall all by himself. He deserved to have somebody.
Our penguin, right?
Billy Prince is asking you to prom.
Kirsten, that bran muffin has like 75 fat grams.
We'd love to transition a gay guy into the group.
Wow - I-
Not at all!
Where're we taking him?
The deadly nightshade you slipped me wore off, Sally... I thought I'd find you here....
If you went away, what would become of me?
I do the best I can to make it comfortable for us here.
I told you I want that room unpacked.
Alright then, what is it?  Bird rabies? That cheap seed you've been buying?
Oh, God, Jesse - I know you're there! Stop him!
Wanna join your little friend?
You two got a thing going, or what?
So, you live around here.
your timing was perfect - I was getting the third degree in there.
You okay?
You mean a shithead.
I think it's sad...
"March 7th - Glen asked me to sleep with him again.  I can't yet - I like him, I want to make him happy but I'm not sure that I love him. I can't sleep with someone I don't love."
What's all this.
Well, what am I supposed to do?
Yeah?
It's gone now.
Who, Jesse?
Maybe we should call a doctor.
I'm not taking drugs, Dad.  Can I go to bed now?
Hi, guys.
Good morning, Jennifer.
If Simms catches you in here after lights out, she'll chew my ass ragged.
You didn't think we'd let you go alone?
It was great seeing you again.  I'm glad you dropped by.
I used to live in this house.
Joey needs us.  I can feel him.
What's that?
Hi, sweet stuff.  Good news.
The whole wing's devoted ot this program.  That's your office.
Max, where's Kristen?
You got five minutes.
It beats Dr. Simm's theory.  She thinks it's nothing but sex, drugs, and rock & roll.
Tell me about the kids.
My father an I...well, the family just seemed to fall apart.
It was.  Neil, do you believe in other realities?
I'm serious.
That's right.
I can't believe I just did that.
Take us there, Kristen.
We can try again.
What are we going to do?
You're not going in.  That's exactly what he wants.  As long as you're on Hypnocyl, it's the only way he can get to you.
I'm Taryn White.  I only came here because it was a better deal than juvie hall.  Also, I guess 'cause I'm going through some very stange shit.
Who is he?
What'd you do, take the scenic route?
That's precisely what they need.  Some uninterrupted REM sleep to release all this negative energy.
Somebody else is out here.
You do volunteer work at the hospital?
This wing's been closed for years.  What was this place?
You said something before...about laying him to rest...?
How is he?
What did you think?
Okay, you're attacked by the Bog Demon. Go ahead.
I wonder if you could tell me where the...?
I see friends from university -- clever chaps -- been in the business longer than you -- they're scraping by on seven, eight thousand a year. It's no life.  What sort of acting do you do?
Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the pay in movies?  I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?
I apologize for the 'surreal but nice' comment.  Disaster...
Probably best not tell anyone about this.
Oh hi.  It's William Thacker.  We, ahm I work in a bookshop.
Perhaps I could drop round for tea or something?
Hi.
I'm sorry -- I arrived outside -- they thrust this thing into my hand -- I didn't know what to do.
Well, it was nice to meet you. Surreal but nice.
Ah no -- that's the point -- they're private villages -- only the people who live round the edges are allowed in.
No, I didn't.
It's a disease I've got -- it's a clinical thing.  I'm taking pills and having injections -- it won't last long.
I'm rash and I'm stupid and what am I doing with you?
-- this is a fairly strange reality to be faced with.  To be honest, I don't realize...
I don't know.  It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him.  And you... and love?
I have thought about you.
'Message from command.  Would you like them to send in the HKs?'
'Very well, captain -- I'll pass that on straightaway.'
Cartwright.
'Certainly.  And little Johnny?'
I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James. But, you know -- this writer's pretty damn good too.
The thing that's so irritating is that now I'm so totally fierce when it comes to nudity clauses.
Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.
Rita Hayworth used to say -- 'they go to bed with Gilda -- they wake up with me.' Do you feel that?
Can I stay a bit longer?
I don't know what happened.
You can stay calm -- it's the perfect situation for you -- minimum input, maximum publicity.  Everyone you ever bump into will know.  'Well done you -- you slept with that actress -- we've seen the pictures.'
You're right: of course, you're right. It's just that I've dealt with this garbage for ten years now -- you've had it for ten minutes.  Our perspectives are different.
This is certainly... ah...
But... wait... there are things to say.
Hi.
Well... how have you been?
You were saying...
But yesterday... that actor asked you who I was... and you just dismissed me out of hand... I heard -- you had a microphone... I had headphones.
Yes, I'm pretty sure I would.
Can I just say, I thought 'Ghost' was a wonderful film.
Yup.
No.  Not true...
Bloody hell, this is fun.
By the way -- it's you.
The phone number of Anna Scott's agent in London and her agent in New York. You can ring her.  You think about her all the time -- now you can ring her!
Ahm... room service.
Well, yes -- usually -- I'd just changed to go home -- but I thought I'd just deal with this final call.
No, I'm sure it'll be fine.
I did.
Well, you tell me which bit you liked most -- and I'll tell you if I enjoyed making it.
Classic.  Absolutely classic. Profit from major sales push -- minus ?347.
That's right -- Topol.
I have to disturb you when you're cooking the books, but there's a delivery.
But it's not for the shop.  It's for you.
Excuse me -- it's your mother on the phone.
I actually tried that tack -- but she said you said that before and it's been twenty-four hours, and her foot that was purple is now a sort of blackish color...
Buggered?
Wait a minute -- I'm your brother and I don't know anything about this.
Can I help you?
I'm afraid I can't really let you through then, sir.
That's right -- I'm at last going out on a date with the great Janine and I just want to be sure I've picked the right t-shirt.
Cool, huh?
Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done.
There's something wrong with this yogurt.
Just incidentally -- why are you wearing that?
Groovy.  You should do more of this stuff.
Spike.  For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip.
Are you sure you...?
So, I saw you put that book down your trousers.
Right -- well, then we have something of an impasse.  I tell you what -- I'll call the police -- and,	what can I say? -- If I'm wrong about the whole book-down-the-trousers scenario, I really apologize.
But you have no proof.
Why?
P-p-p-please du-du-du-don't t-t tell her, p-p-please...
Sh-sh-sh-she m-m-made m-m-me do it!
Get up, Billy.
N-n-n-n-duh-duh-duh-pl-pl-pl-pl-muh muh-muh...
Is there anything else?
Mister McMurphy, this ward is a democratic community run by the patients and their votes, so you should feel at ease in your new surroundings to the extent you can freely discuss emotional problems in front of the patients and staff. However, the cardinal rule, and I must emphasize this: Everyone keeps their seat during the meeting!
Sorry to have bothered you.
Now you boys hurry along and wash up for breakfast...  You too, Mister McMurphy.
After breakfast, Mister McMurphy, after breakfast.
Certainly, Mister McMurphy.
Yeah, it'll satisfy me.
So do I!
Yeah, ya should've come along with us, Miss Ratched, an' gotten a little sun on your cheeks and maybe caught a fish or two.
I hope everything is settled.
Come on, don't crap out on me now. We got two buddies out there!
'K-Kay, M-Mack!
What is it, kid?
W-W-We h-heard y-you w-were n-never c-c-coming back!
I-I-I-I-I'll g-g-g-go, M-M-Mack...
In ya go...
Go with him, Rose. Go with him.
I second the motion!
Where's Martini and Scanlon?
Yeah, where we going?
Which gets you shipped up to Disturbed for a nice little zap job.
What?
Mine, too!
He's a big flounder. Could weigh two, three hundred. You got to lift him in with a winch.
Yeah, Harding, where do you breathe anyway?
I'll bet a dollar.
What are you doing?
It's as simple as that. You've been on our ward six hours and have already simplified the work of Freud, Jung and Maxwell Jones in one grand analogy: it's a pecking party.
Electro-Shock Therapy, my friend. Five cents' worth of electricity and you are out of everybody's hair.
Lobotomy!
What's the use! Hooee! It'd do you birds some good just to get a little exercise lifting your arms to vote!
You're fuckin' A-right, I am!
So why are you talking to him?
You can come back later!
Hey, Harding, wake me in an hour.
When?
You need four houses on every lot of the same color, Martini. Now let's go, for Christsakes.
Psst! Hey, Martini, wake up!
My, my... Ah, who are you?
You bet, Doc!
Yes, well, Miss Ratched feels that you're a disturbing influence on the other patients.
Come on, Doc, you must be kiddin'.
Your medicine, Mister McMurphy.
Don't get upset, Mister McMurphy...
'Kay, let's see...  Cheswick first ... then Billy... Martini... Scanlon... Sefelt... Fredrickson... Taber an' the Chief... 'Kay
What's troubling ya, buddy?
How do ya know that?
Put your money where your mouth is, Taber.
I'll bet a buck you don't do it!
Scanlon! Hey, Scanlon, wake up!
Oh yeah...
What are they?
You comin' in to hold my hand?
Okay, Mack!  Whoowe, Candy girl, are we in an insane asylum or ain't we?
Who is he?
Hit me!
There they are!
Yes, sir, it's a mighty nice fall day...
Yes, sir, I sure am gonna enjoy my stay here.
Of course.  Mister McMurphy.
Stand aside, Sam, Nature's callin'.
You've been drinking on the job again, haven't you, Mister Turkle!
I want those men put back to bed, Mister Turkle!
What happened?
Oh, that. That ain't nothin' to be afraid of, ma'am. Just ol Chief Bromden. That's all...
They're sleeping, Miss. They're sleeping. An' we gotta keep it down so we don't disturb their sleep.
Great.  Because, like I said, until you find it, we can't let you on the plane.
You didn't have that with you before.  Prima non l'aveva con se.
Excuse me?
Is he some kind of celebrity or something?
Good.
We found each other, didn't we?
You don't think this is just infatuation, do you?
I'm engaged.  I'm supposed to be married in two days.
A very large pig.
...has a prior commitment.
Yeah, but, what if this guy lived a billion, trillion years ago? Like, what if he was a cave man, and now he's dead?
I'll bring it back as soon as I can.
You...
Congratulations.
That's not the point.
You stubbed your toe, don't you think that's a sign?
Don't you see?..  We're not the ones who are meant to be.  You're the man of somebody else's dreams.
I went back to that restaurant and I spoke with his waiter, just on an off chance, you know, and, anyway-- he knew the name of the guy's hotel.  So, I called there, they said he left yesterday.  But, apparently he comes here every year, always follows the same route.  He always goes from here down the coast to the Le Sirenuse hotel in Positano.  I called.  And they told me he's checked in.
Mickey Spillane.
Nice dress.
Why are you doing this?
Well, what about books?  You like Hemingway?  You gotta love Hemingway.
You okay?
I'm sorry.
Yeah.  Well, was the least I could do.
I'd call that a yes.  Do I get a hint?
I sabotaged it?  You're the one who lost him, remember?
Very funny.
And this is the thanks I get.  I did you a favor.  You never wanted to marry that joker in the first place.
Look, I just thought if you finally got rid of this obsession with this name, if you could get it out of your system once and for all, then maybe you'd be able to stop waiting and open your heart to someone real.  Granted, ideally, me.  I didn't do it to hurt you.  I did it for you.  I did it for us...
I was hoping for the real thing.
Sure.
So what do you think?
Faith, this is my mother.
I don't have an Amana freezer.
Metaphorically, I still don't have an Amana freezer.
But somebody wrote those songs.
Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.
A foreign land full of millions of Italian men...  speaking Italian with Italian accents and those huge brown eyes and that silky olive skin...
Now what do we do?
Ah ha!...
You think he misses me at all?
Anna, I'm Faith.  You don't know how happy I am to meet you.  You see, I'm trying to find someone, and--
So what's in a name?  I wanna join him.  I don't see why we can't join him.
He's sitting in the fourth booth down, on the left hand side, with his back to us.  He's wearing a navy jacket.  If you turn around, you can see part of his right elbow.
Well, nobody can say we didn't try.
No... Like a psychiatrist.
Hi-iii...
I thought you were the one who didn't think I should've come in the first place.
Yeah, well, obviously it wasn't meant to be.  I've got forty-eight hours.  I can still make it home in time to marry Dwayne and try to forget any of this ever happened.
Whatareyoudoing?!
Maybe if I kiss him I'll feel it.
He's a jerk.
So...
Well, I realized, if you're getting married, you're gonna be needing the maid of honor, right?
Well... I ought to be getting home anyway.  The kids'll be back from camp soon.  The house is probably a mess.
What about Larry?
You are looking for a place to stay, no, Kate?
Oh, hello.  I just came by to see if you wanted to join me for a drink, but--
Giovanni, I want to thank you.
No, you don't understand.  It's been wonderful meeting you.  But... I have a husband.  I have two kids at camp.  I have a life I have to go back to.
Huh?
Kate, you're still there?  I thought you'd be on your way home by now.
Not only is it tacky, it's exploitation.
It was just a joke.  I was pushing the arrow.  I wanted to get to the next question.  I wanted to find out who was gonna win the Series.
And you didn't tell her?
And don't be walking off with any of that. You know how the boss feels about individual pilferage.
If you kept your ears wide open instead of your mouth—
Doesn't it seem odd to you that five different waterfront locals were broken into last night and the only articles removed were financial records?
After what we been hearing about your brother, I thought your throat'd be kind of dry.
Johnny, I can't do that. I can't do that, Johnny.
You said they was only going to talk to him.
I thought they'd talk to him. Try to get him to dummy up.
Come on, kid. I'll buy you a drink.
Johnny does you favors, kid. You got to do a little one for him once in a while.
Mm—hmm.
I always figured I'd live longer without it.
Ten cents a hundred pounds on everything that moves in and out. And you don't have to lift a finger. It'll be three-four hundred a week just for openers.
Well, then, you know Cousin Johnny isn't going to jeopardize a setup like that for one rubber-lipped—
...eight-seven, eighty-eight. What's it to you?
Don't turn away! Look at it! You're in this too— don't you see, don't you see? You're in this too, Father.
Oh, I thought you was gonna go to work— with all them muscles. 
Everybody loved Joey. From the little kids to the old rummies.  Did you know him very well?
You know how the Sisters are.
In braids? That's right.
I remember you were in trouble all the time.
What's that?
What?
When Mother died Pop sent me out to school in the country. He was afraid with no one home I'd— get into bad company.
What for?
It's quite—  –nice.
A dive? You mean, into the water?
Terry!
He was looking at everybody the same way. Asking the same question.
You don't believe in anything, do you?
Like Joey? Are you afraid to mention his name?
You haven't finished your beer.
You're not sore at me?
I— I never knew a girl like you, Edie. I always knew the kind you just grab 'em And— I never knew a girl like you, Edie.
Edie, listen, stay out of this mess. Quit tryin' to ask things about Joey. It ain't safe for you.
Edie, your old man's right, go back to that school out in daisyland. You're driving yourself nuts— you're driving me nuts— stop worrying about the truth— worry about yourself.
I don't rate it.
Yeah, yeah, it's up to me, it's up to me— he says it's up to me.
Edie, listen to me! I want you to believe me. I want to be with you.
That—  —word again! Why do you keep saying conscience, conscience... .
Edie...
Jimmy...
Every one of 'em... .
Then go ahead— go ahead! Go down to the shape-up and get yourself killed, you stupid, pigheaded, son of a—  What are you trying to prove? With a decisive gesture Terry takes the hook and sticks it through his belt. Then he goes to the wall and lifts Joey's windbreaker from the nail on which it has been hanging. He puts the windbreaker on in a deliberate way, and grins at her as he does so; then he walks to the door with a sense of dignity he has never had before.
It's like carrying a monkey around on your back.
If I spill, my life won't be worth a nickel.
Give me that gun.
Who asked him here?
Nice fellows.
You still call it ratting?
Never will be much too soon.
Be at the State House, Courtroom Nine, at ten o'clock tomorrow.
Where you going? I'll walk along with you.
I ought to belt you one, J.P.
What's the matter wit' you, success gone to ya head?
—I was gonna feed 'em, Terry.
Hey, Terry, guess who's here... that joker from the Commission... .
Count this.
Shut up. I like the kid.  Remember the night he took Farella at St. Nick's, Charley. We won a bundle. Real tough. A big try.
—Do you?
Oh, he did. Half an hour later a certain Timothy J. Nolan went into secret session with the Commission and he did all the talking.
He don't, huh?  Well, he knows thirty-nine pages worth of our operation.
From where you stand, maybe. But I'm standing over here now. I was rattin' on myself all them years and didn't know it, helpin' punks like you against people like Pop and Nolan an'... .
You know what I mean. Leave her alone.
Yeah, yeah— Here's half a buck, go have yourself a ball.
You see, Kayo, the good Lord watches over us after all.
All of my books are based on fact, or legend.  Thats perhaps why they're more interesting and sell in the top spots.
I'm getting the jitters! Let's turn back!
Silly, there's nothing in there to be afraid of.
Not dead?  In a cemetery?
Can't we get out of here?
Look!
I'm so frightened.
My guess is if we don't take the chance pretty soon, we're not going to have much life left anyway.
<i>Him!</i>  I'll bet he sleeps with all the lights on.
You love me then?
But they are not yet one of us.
When!?
I understand, Master
The time...is short.
Your pleasures of course!
You may take her now.
We had lots of snakes in my ancient Egypt...slimy, slinky things.
When I was alive, they were the things nightmares were made of.
He wants us.
You know that Super Bowl party?  They changed the date.  It's on <u>tonight</u>, eight-thirty.
What happened to Mandrake the Magician?
Glenn Michaels.
Oh, is this Adele?
I want to speak with you, please.
He called the day he escaped.
He said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life.
I'm not dressed.
I don't know why, but every time he opens his mouth I want to punch him out.
Chino's gonna wanna talk to me.
There.  You see the guy sitting on the porch?  The old ladies and one guy? You know they'll have a couple more in a car somewhere.
Let's go to Detroit.
I think she's after Glenn.  The girl still with you?
You didn't tell your sister about Ripley, did you?  'Cause I don't wanna go through that again.
Now that's a really big house.
I mean, they don't know for sure he's dead.  Look, there's always a chance we'll walk out've there with nothing.  I say let fate decide.
My sister believes in fate, but not hell.  That's why she stopped praying for the lost souls since you don't hear that much about purgatory anymore. But every day she asks her boss to pray I don't fuck up.  Whatta you think, you think there's a hell, Jack?
Listen, I gotta get some better shoes, few other things before tomorrow.  Why don't you drop me off at the Ren Cen, we'll hook up later?
You find out?
So what's that mean?  That you're disappointed by what you found or you're sorry you robbed all those banks?
There's still time, take me up on my offer.
Come <i>on</i>.
I'm going back inside.
No, you dump the van, meet me at the airport. I'll take one of Ripley's cars.
What'd you talk about?
Foley made me think of that fella Carl Tillman, the one you were seeing, it turns out the same time he was doing banks.  You recall that?
We'll talk another time, Karen.  All right?  I'd like to know why Foley put you in that second car when he didn't need you any more.
Daniel.  Listen --
Yeah, I know.  I was just leaving. Why were you trying to reach me?
Yes or no, Daniel.  If I get him, will you let me go after Foley?
What do you want to bet?
Daniel Burdon, please.  Karen Sisco.
Quite a mess.
Other than we had so much fun the last time we worked together.  You gonna tell me why you're comin' to me instead of the FBI?
Yeah, and, as you can see, home invasions are big, too.
Snoopy Miller, famous fight thrower.
Like being back in the yard, huh?
What's the matter with right here? It's nice and warm.
Reggie, push off and hit, man.  Push him off.
Who, Buddy?  Yeah.  He's a good guy. Back when we jailed together, he'd call his sister every week without fail.  She's a born-again Christian, does bookkeeping for a televangelist. Buddy calls her up, confesses his sins, tells her about whatever bank he happened to rob.
How many was that?
You don't seem all that scared.
You don't act like it.
It was just a year, give or take a few days.  I mean, it's not like we didn't get along or anything.  We had fun, we just didn't have that... that thing, you know?  That spark, you know what I mean?  You gotta have that.
You know, this isn't gonna end well, these things never do.
Get your hands up and turn around. <u>Now</u>.
You know who this is?
None of your business.
Let's see.  You could come on by my dad's place, drop 'em off.
There's a guy here on the task force right now.  Maybe I should put him on the phone, let you two work it out.
A girl.
Having it cleaned didn't help, huh?
If I remembered you.  I came looking for you.  I would've said sure, let's do it.  But for all you knew I could show up with a SWAT team.  Why would you trust me?
You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.
You coming back?
I'm sorry, Jack, but I can't shoot you.
He got three years and fined fifty million dollars and wrote 'em a fucking check.  Like that, fifty mil, signed his name.  Whoa-- little help here!
You guys-- come on-- this is too heavy!
Some people are going out of here. What if I told you where and when?
You're smart, Ripley, you'll tell this guy to fuck off.
Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn? I mean, do <u>you</u> believe Glenn?
Tell me something, Jack, how much longer you in here?
It's a little late for me.
I don't know.  I'm not exactly the nine-to-five type.
I can't say that I've paid that much attention to 'em before.
Jesus Christ, what the hell are you doing here?  What's going on?  Who's upstairs?
I can't believe you're still angry with me, Jack, after all this time.
Don't be an asshole, Richard.  They're gonna kill you.
You were at Leavenworth, huh?
Meaning?
And how long was it before they caught up with you?
You must be some kinda walker, Henry.
She did, huh.
Yeah, could be.  Or maybe she thought we'd have a lot to talk about.
Glenn, I know your life history, who your friends are, where you've been and now, it looks like, where you're going.  Put your hands on the wheel.
Ripley?  You mean the wall street guy?
You there?
Walk in a house with me, do this cross- dressin' nigga named Eddie Solomon I used to sell to been dealin' on his own.
How's it going?
Glenn?  No, I don't know any Glenn.
Here?  In this house?
Well, <i>he</i> ain't even here that much.  I like to know where he goes, but at the same time I don't <i>want</i> to know, you understand?
Got run over by a car.
It's beautiful.
Thanks, Dad.
Can we change the subject?
Dad...
"Hey, yourself."
What are you thinking about?
Ray's with the F.B.I. Task Force, working on the prison break.
Maybe.  But you're also curious about the man.  Twice last night you asked your married boyfriend Nicolet about him.  You were concerned, but you didn't want to show it.
You wave back?
So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in.
Not yet.  Where's Mr. Ripley?
You here all by yourself?
The woman also said he stole her husband's gun, a twenty-two pistol, and some of his clothes.
Thank you...
Excuse me.  Snoopy?  Did we settle the fish thing?
You good-lookin' sumbitch...don't you EVER die!
What, good-lookin' sumbitch?
Do you have trouble with your boobs in the uniform?
We'll ask Evelyn.  Evelyn?  Evelyn!
Nervous?
Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?
Oh yeah.  I liked it so much I'm cutting you out of the squadron.
I don't buy that hot dog shit.  So you and your buddies are gonna transfer your planes up to Haleiwa.
Rafe's girl, Evelyn?
Ever hear of mai-tai's?  Comes in a big...pot.  Like...like...
They ready, Earl?
Earl!  You said the planes were ready but -- but what?
Don't make this a joke, Rafe.  You're talking about war, and I know what war does to people.
Then why are you looking for her?
Sorry.
Waitress!  Four beers!
It's tight.
I got a half a tank.  You?
Land of the free.
I'm out of ammo!
It's not getting any longer.
Broomsticks instead of tail guns.
And I'm on yours.  Land of the free.
Rafe's folks had a crop dusting business, owned their own planes.  Real straight, frugal.  My father was the town drunk. Went to sleep one night on the railroad tracks and was still there when the Dawn Express came along.  Rafe and I were the only ones at the funeral.  He took me back to his house, and I never left.
I taught him to drink beer.  He taught me how to fly.
Listen you guys.  I'm the first plane -- then McCawley, Walker, the rest of you. I'll have the shortest run.  If I don't make it, you don't go.
How'd you get this?
Win?
Colonel Doolittle pulled the strings, and put me on loan to the R.A.F.  They need pilots, and we need experience.  I leave tomorrow.
I saw you, I couldn't go in, I...just stood there wondering if you knew.  You looked...sad, and I had to sit down a minute.
It's all right.  Danny always said I see things with my emotions instead of my eyes.
Don't worry about that.  Guys away from home, lonely, good-hearted women try to cheer them up.
We have achieved surprise, but their carriers are not in port.  I don't like this.
We have bombed Tokyo, Mr. President. Radio Tokyo interrupted it's own broadcast to make the announcement.
The Chinese are sending out search parties to try to find the crews before the Jap patrols do, if any of the planes make it.
Well which of those three ya want fixed?
Fook ya!
So you join us, Admiral.  Some of us thought your education at an American university would make you too weak to fight the Americans.
Hello, Lilla!
Do you believe in all of that?
I feel ridiculous. Maybe I should go home and change.
Hi, Peggy. God, that Walter Getz	can still dance.
They're waiting. Come on.
Where is it?
Peggy Sue!
You don't want them? They're going to make a big comeback any minute. Mark my words, these lamps are going to...
How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?
Well, we got the prom coming up, all these parties. We shouldn't upset our parents?
Charlie, how are you?
There isn't a girl in school that can hold a candle to you..
A lot's happened since last weekend.
You know. Your love machine... the throbbing thrill hammer... your thing!
I'm sorry Charlie.
Charlie. About last nights..
Charlie. I just had the strangest dream.
What are you doing here?
I want to know what's going on. Dolores told me that you and that scuzzball Michael Fitzsimmons...
I will be happy if I have you. I love you.
I'd forgotten how much music meant to you.
Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.
Look. I wanna tell you. I forgive you for everything. I know what you've been going through. You're just scared. I was scared, too, but I'm not anymore.
Peggy! Where're you going? Come back!
It couldn't be me.  I hardly knew him.
Charlie, I had a strange experience.  I went back to high school. And I spent a lot of time with you.  And you and Walter and Leon were singing "I Wonder Why".
Hello, Charlie.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir. But that's what I like about her. She's not like all the other girls at school.
Carol and I saw you with that creep, Richard, today.
Terry, slow down.
Terry! Slow down.
You know, Peggy Sue, your mother said you had a dream that I died.
Right now you're just browsing through time. Choose the things you'll be proud of. The things that Last.
You don't?
A ray of oneness piercing the solitude. Falling bodies in the ecstasy of flesh. You'll be a chapter in my memoirs of desire.
No, I just made that up. Do you want to hear one?
Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.
Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay.
I wanted to apologize for this morning.
Yes.
Oh no!
Oh, you're both so naive.
Chanel Number Five. That always reminds me of home.
Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't you ready?
Would they go over my girdle or under?
You know, dear, I think the pantyhose is a wonderful idea, but the next time you come up with something, please don't stay out all night. Just tell us. We'll believe you.
What are you doing?
Hello. Nice to meet you. Please call me Peggy. I'm Peggy Bodell now.
I have to talk to you. It's very important.
Okay, you're not dead, but according to every law of science what you say happened to you is impossible.
You're a molecule in chaos, a discontinuent aberration. Maybe you've just got powers of precognition. Well, maybe you're just out of whack.
I'm curious, but I don't want to know. Jeez, I hope you haven't been telling people what's going to happen to them.
Good. You're discreet. I like that in a partner.
There are major fortunes to be made here. Leisure time and life—styles.
It was an unfair fight. He didn't have a chance. I'm taking a real gamble. I loved him for a long, long time.
Will you take of f your blouse?
Richard! You should be ashamed of yourself.
You were meant to  You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to.
Yeah, yeah. I'm taking a big gamble. I've loved him for a long, long time.
Did she always have reporters following her around like this?
You took over for Doctor Yolander?
Is something wrong?
I hope he doesn't have rabies.
All set?
Drew, I don't remember inviting Zowie in for dinner.
Zowie...
I swear, sometimes I wish Gus was dead...
Why not?
I've never had anyone die before...  ...but I guess you get over it. I mean, eventually...
Do you think everyone that came back would be like Gus?
How long have you been here?
If MacroSystems wins, an energetic, young company will be destroyed, five thousand Americans will be out of work. Moreover, the laws of copyright and anti-trust were enacted to prevent exactly the kind of bullshit Macrosystems is trying to pull.
Yes!
Jesus.
Allright. Calm down.
Do you really think so, Andy?
Why, Beckett?
This time. What about next time?
Why are you getting dressed?
You're scared. You think we're near the end.
I'm ready...
We've been talking it over, Andy. Your future that is... We feel that, because we respect you so much, we have to be honest with you.
I hoped the challenge would improve your performance. You could say it was a carrot.
... meanwhile, I'd like to prepare you for a colonoscopy, so we can take a look inside.
Your Honor, since Rockwell Corp. began construction, the surrounding residential neighborhood has been enshrouded in a cloud of foul-smelling, germ-carrying, pestilent dust. My client is being forced to breathe known carcinogens daily! Other residents are coming forth on a daily basis to add their voices of outrage!
Client of yours?
Congratulations.
Correct. I'm seeking representation.
I misplaced an important complaint. That's their story. Want to hear mine?
I buy that.
Rayisha.
The partner who spotted the lesion, Walter Kenton, used to work for Benton, Myers, in D.C. There's a paralegal there, Maria Torres. She's had lesions on and off for three years. She says it was common knowledge around the office that her lesions were caused by AIDS.
Get it?
You think I'm uncomfortable...
Then we establish how Wheeler's boys recruited you after law school...
For a healthy baby. For Lisa to make it through the delivery. For the Phillies to get into the playoffs.
I'll look over the Q and A.
He was... the kind of person I thought I wanted to be.
In the years you worked at Wyant Wheeler, did you ever tell Charles Wheeler you were gay?
Can you explain <u>why</u> you didn't?
Are you a good lawyer?
Can you see the lesions on your chest in this mirror?
What do you call a thousand lawyers chained together at the bottom of the ocean?
In general. Do you take risks in other areas of your life?
But you <u>were</u> having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985?
While you were employed at Wyant Wheeler, you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual, correct?
In some situations.
Hello?
What's Dr. Gillman say?
Gillman says I'm fine. My blood work is excellent. T-cells are up. Just a sec ...  Yes, I think that would alleviate most of our concerns.  My platelets look good too.
I said my earrings <u>are</u> American. They're African-American.
And, when lawyers break the law, when this society loses respect for the law, when that day comes, our cherished institutions will be burned to the ground, and our children and grandchildren will live like savages.
Objection!
You had contact with someone who has AIDS, and you're worried.
We're going to draw blood.
It doesn't travel through the air, by breathing, or touching, right?
Unprotected sex with a prostitute.
Were you pleased with his work?
It's a long way between being overwhelmed and being satisfied. A cheeseburger may be satisfying whereas caviar and champagne and roast duck and baked Alaska for dessert might be considered overwhelming. Do you agree?
Andy. Before we begin, I'd just like to say: everyone in this room is your friend.
Let's put it this way, Andy: your place in the future of this firm is no longer secure.
What's the matter with you? Do I look gay to you?
I mean, two guys, doing the horizontal thing? I don't get it. Don't they get confused? "Is that mine? I thought it was yours." Hey, call me old fashioned, call me conservative... I think maybe you have to be a man to get just how nauseating the whole basic idea really is.
And the way they work out, pumping up, so they can be macho and faggot at the same time... I can't <u>stand</u> that shit. Now I'm being totally honest with you.
Yeah. Do I have a case?
Now that you mention it...
Whoa, whoa...  What do you expect them to say, you're Alan Dershowitz?
Going on... like...?
Reinstatement at full salary. Back pay covering the period of unemployment and...
It's good to be King, hey Charles?
Julius!
What about other homosexual facilities, whatever they are?
I didn't tell the others, I was afraid to...
Audrey? Oh, Audrey....
Tell me that was you.
Three full bottles. But almost time to refill.
Tell me about the sounds. You told them you heard something right before....  If you don't talk to me, Johns'll take another crack at it -- at your skull.
All you people are so scared of me -- an' most days, I'd take that as a compliment -- but it ain't me you gotta worry about now.
Then where is he? He's not in the hole. We looked.
An' now you're worried about a repeat of history?
Riddick...was thinkin' we should make some kind of deal. Just in case, you know, this actually --
What about her?
I promised them we'd go back with more light. And that's exactly what we're gonna do..
You'd die for them?
What do my eyes see?
What, switch what?
I don't need his life story. Is he really that dangerous?
What?
I <u>am</u> sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And you're playing right into --
You're not a real cop, are you? Just some mercenary who goes around talkin' about the law like --
You have a little caffeine in the morning, I have a little morphine. So what?
Not a problem unless you're gonna make --
Smoke screen for what?
He'll lead you over the first cliff. You know that, don't you?
This does not help us, Johns.
Well? Is it just the pump?
1550 millibars, dropping 20 MB per minute, shit, we're hemorrhaging air. <u>Somethin'</u> took a swipe at us.
Fry?
Look, Fry. Company says we're responsible for every one of those --
Well...we must keep her close, then. Here, she'll be safe if we put her between --
SULEIMAN!
Oh, Trash Baby, you're gonna regret this.
A toast to whatever he just said.
Want you to remember this moment, Riddick. The way it coulda gone and didn't.
My recommendation: Do me. Don't take the chance that I'll get shiv-happy on your wannabe ass. Ghost me, Riddick. Would if I were you.
About how to kill us and still get these cells to the skiff. Goddamnit, we're just doin' the heavy lifting for this prick!
Ain't all of us gonna make it.
Look, it's hellified stuff -- but no different than those battlefield doctors when they have to decide who lives and who dies. It's called "triage," okay?
Don't wanna feed these land-sharks -- just keep 'em off our scent.
What, you don't really think they left with their clothes on the lines? Photos on the walls?
No sir, I haven't forgotten.
You've never told me why this region's called the Forbidden Zone.
That's Bright Eyes. The one I was telling you about.
Flight is a scientific impossibility.
'Then how do you account for me?,
'I am not a missing link.'
A toy. It floats on the air.  Try it.
No.
Where there's one there's another. And another. And another.
Well, at least they haven't tried to bite us.
You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment.
State your case, Mr. Prosecutor.
That's true, Dr. Zaius. My witnesses -- correction -- my exhibits are on display in the amphitheater.
Objection! These remarks are profane and irrelevant.
It's no use ... there she goes.
Gone.
Landon! Join the expedition.
It's a little late for a wake. She's been dead nearly a year.
If only we could get a fix.
All right --
And the glory, don't forget that. There's a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere. It's probably turned green by now, and nobody can read the name plate. But never let it be said we forget our heroes.
Okay. You read me well enough. Why can't I read you?
Scarecrows?
Can we take a dip?
No cigar.
We got off at the wrong stop.
Who are you?
I want her.
Why did you do that? Scrape off your hair?
Sorry, Lucius. You'll have to stay here and guard the horses.
All right, all right. Will You do me a favor? No orders.
Lucius.
I told you not to bring the other one.
Gorilla hunters ...
You asked for the opportunity to present your case. Surely you must know why you're here.
You destroyed his memory! His mind! His identity! And, you want to do the same to me!
Sustained. In all fairness, Dr. Zira, you must admit the accused is a nonape, and therefore has no rights under ape law.
What about me?
No.
Then how is it we speak the same language?  Even in your lies, some truth slips through! That mythical community you're supposed to come from -- Fort Wayne'?
I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where's your nest, Taylor? Where are your women?
You may well call it upside down, since you occupy its lowest level. And deservedly.  The eastern desert has never been explored -- because we've always assumed that no life can exist there.  Save yourself, Taylor. Tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone?
Stop right there.
Of course.
Speak! Go on.	Speak again.
Cornelius and I have been indicted for heresy. Unless we can prove our theories, we don't stand a chance of acquittal.
Are you going to take her with you?
You're dead, you're fucking dead Elias!
...You keep pouring out that suppressing fire, Barnes. I don't wanna be caught out there with my ass hanging out you hear me?
So what's the problem?
Bob, I gotta bad feeling about this, I... I'm telling you I got a bad feeling, man, I don't think I'm gonna make it... y'know what I mean?
Hey Big Harold, gimme your peaches for the fruitcake man.
Hey Taylor, you don't know it but I saved your ass today. I killed a shit-eating dog. 
Listen to that shit, that's good shit!
Yeah! I got two of them fuckers...
Hey Taylor, you okay man?
You okay man? Neck botherin' you?
...you know that night we got hit... I... 
You been smoking too much shit babe. Gotta control that. Takes a man down... I remember when you first come out to the bush, you was straight as a...
Way out of anything, man. Just keep your pecker up, your powder dry, the worm WILL turn. How many days you short?
What we got here a crusader?
Whatcha doing in the underworld Taylor?
Merle?
Then you jes gonna forget 'bout Elias and all the good times we done had? Right in here.
Vancouver, B.C.
Indefinitely?
Dine and dance tonight? I've got fifty bucks to throw away.
I think you're drunk.
Your liquor laws..
It might be worth a Martini to you.
No.. not very well. And I like his friends even less. But..  If you really want a good dry Martini..
You're drinking it.
Would it make you anymore amusing?
I didn't say anything.
You said it wasn't a tragedy.
There isn't one.. That anyone would believe. I went for a walk after dinner, down to the ocean...alone... I came up and went to bed. I didn't sleep very well. Then there was a thunderstorm. And it began to rain. I went across to close the French door. That's the first time I saw him out there.
There's a lot of night left to live through.
Dance? Tonight?
That man over there. He was in the hotel lobby.
That's the second round I've lost tonight.  That fellow hurt me.
There's a lot of water between Vancouver and the U.S.A. This note is a suicide note.  After you're gone where would they look for you?  Why would they look for you? Darkness, and open water, and a fast cabin cruiser.  And I have a pocket full of money.  And if I helped you, I'd be committing a crime, or so they tell me.
How bad is it?  Bad enough for-- 
Take me where I haven't the courage to take myself.
This is the ace, Betty.  But not of spades.  They'll find out about the other.  They might know already. And when they get this--  What would they look for?  Where? Out there somewhere? 
If they had any reason to.  Why make it tough for themselves?  Why go to all that trouble?  Here's an open book.  Close it.  No reason to keep it open.  She was a nice girl, anyway.  And perhaps she didn't kill him on purpose.  Perhaps she didn't kill the other one. You never know.  Give her the benefit of the doubt.  Leave her stay where she is.  Close the book. Finis.
You'll be safe here.  I won't be long.  Help yourself to anything you want. The galley's through there.  You can make coffee if you like.
I decided I didn't want a drink...I'm beginning to wonder.
Magruder obliged me.  No use my saying it wasn't planned that way. I had to clean up.  I'm not a dumb- smart college boy anymore.  Nobody in the world would believe I didn't plan the whole thing.
Don't go soft on me, baby.  I've got your note in my pocket.  You wrote it, all by your own self. And I have to use it.  It has to be found in exactly the right place.
Mine?
Would I want to?
Beer or ale, Miss?
That's an evasion and you know it.
Where's you get it?
Good morning, Mr. Killaine. I'm sorry I can't give you the name of my bank--because I have no bank at the moment.  That was a crude trick.
Down below's Stanley Park. On the other side of the trees, there's a beach. You can see it.  Steveston's over there. Coast Guard station.  There's the Yacht Club, and beyond it, the docks. The over on the other side of the inlet, there's Grouse Mountain. It's about 4000 feet high. There's a restaurant on top of it. Very nice restaurant.  I'm sorry we couldn't have met in pleasanter circumstances, Miss Mayfield.
True. I was a bit irritable last night. I apologize.
I'll find out, you know. Perhaps not today--perhaps not tomorrow. But in the end, I'll find out.
He looks at the girl, looks into her eyes--
Palm trees against a sunset--waves breaking on a coral reef--the Taj Mahal by moonlight--roses in an English garden, just after a shower--  Clichés, one and all--but good ones, with a lot of mileage left in them--there's one thing he does not see--murder--and murder was what he was sent to find.  Pretty ridiculous, isn't it?
I can't answer that.
Nice friendly approach you've got. Goble. I could hardly walk when I got out of bed this morning.
I'm still asking. What do you want?
Private eye?
You hurt my feelings. I ought to raise the price to be a thousand.
I don't like your perfume in my office. Make it somewhere else if you don't like Charlie's.
And without much discrimination.
All right, let's see the buzzer.
What?
That's what I like about cocktail parties. Everyone is so perfectly natural.
Information.
It could have been an accident.
I tried it once.  I lost my shirt.
I wouldn't know. Just do it somewhere else. There is such a thing as good manners.
Don't be a fool. I loved him. He wasn't worth it, but I loved him.
So he did--but he hasn't told you what he saw. I have.
Recently, then.
Got a moment, Inspector?
I got through to Greer, his partner in the detective business.  Greer won't give out.
The Super's just given me the sweetest dressing down I've ever had.  I'm still reeling from it. And believe me, I had it coming. I apologize.  What you think is important--I think is important.
I have an appointment with him, right here, right now.
Mr. Brandon couldn't be here.  He might have left something for you. What would it look like?
What do I get for it?
That's pretty risky business, Inspector.
Was that about the right angle?
You've got a dead man on your hands. You killed jim--even if it wasn't murder.  What are you going to do about it?
I've handled it.  Mitchell's handed it.  If I wipe it off, no suicide. If I take it out and lose it, no suicide.  If I leave it here....no suicide.
No suicide.
You win, Inspector.  You win all along the line.  Why didn't we think of Brandon before--or did we-- some of us.  Yeah.  Of course you did.  When a suspect thinks he's safe, you go on letting him think he's safe. Wait for a mistake.
You knew Mitchell pretty well, didn't you, Mrs. West?
You couldn't possible have traced it this soon--not possibly.
I don't understand.
And if you didn't believe me?
Yes, I think so.  Here are two glazed manila envelopes.  One is the bag type.  The other one had the money in it.  Don't ask me how I know.  I know.
You'll have to take my word for it.  We don't make slides until we have perfect prints for comparison.
Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.
Well, find out.  Who's covering her?
This girl is a murderess, Killaine.
I'm afraid you're not very glad to see me, Margo.
So-so.
Margo, darling. You washed me up. Remember? We're just friends. You wanted it that way.
I don't. My hunch is she's just torn up an unhappy marriage. I was able to do her a small favor.
What'll we do about it, Margo?
It's the only pose I have left. I'm sunk. Broke. I don't even have my hotel bill.
I didn't mean it that way  I'm sorry.
Of course.
Mr. Penfield.  I am sorry to have kept you.
My first husband worked for the BBC.  I doubt if anyone there remembers him now, just another long dead diligent administrator. He would have been useful in the fight to preserve the BBC's independence during the Suez crisis - one of the few things he was passionate about.  I became involved too.  I started work on a book that would have been published on the tenth anniversary of Suez. Then he died, and I loots the will to write it.  By the time I was over his death, other books had been published, and it wasn't worth going on.
Thank you.
The references are to Hansard or to newspapers.  I haven't got the actual speeches now.  You'll have to chase them up.
Hello.  Anyone for a walk?  Tom isn't, I can tell you.
Charles!  I didn't know you were back.  Have a good holiday?
It's terribly good.
Committed to memory.  Forever.
Can I give you a lift?
Oh yes?
Damn.  They're early.
Did she talk about me?
I haven't seen much of you.
Look, will you come on a walk with me tomorrow?
Bastard.
To the Fleet.
And the Argies.
...an innocent interest, and found out that last year Vogue ran a series called 'Mothers and Daughters' Number seven, Anne and Susan Barrington.  Being a decent loving friend I went to the files and made a copy for you.
She's very nice, apparently.  Lives in Norfolk.  And very left-wing. You'll have to watch yourself there.
The torture of small children--
Hold those rights.
Delivering gossip and goodwill. It seems we'll both be doing Brighton.  Perhaps you should come too.
Still in love?
And you were obviously getting nowhere with her.  I was waiting for the right moment to tell you that.
Hello.
Hello, Jimmy.
I just might give you a ring when we get back to London.  There's one or two things I'd like to... Will you let me have your number before you leave?  Have you ever watched a commercial being made?
Susan told me that your visits to Norfolk had ... well, an ulterior motive.
It was last year.
Don't point it at James!
It's true!  I was here last year doing a piece, remember?  I was in the bar with all these Northern trade unionists and their sponsored MPs.  They were all incredibly fat and beery, huge trousers and braces. And so sweet.  They all stood round me like children saying 'You! Working for television?  You're just a young thing.'  They wouldn't let me buy drinks even when I told them the programme was paying. They kept looking at my pass which was pinned here and saying  'Oo, can I?'
Don't you want to walk, Tom?
Thanks for stepping in.
The only way to win out here is to surrender.  You have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync.  Just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see.
One shot stopping.
It's a little ceremony we always have at the end of summer.  One last speedstar.
Talk.
Bodhi, this is your wake up call, man -- I... am... an... Eff... Bee... Eye... Agent!!
You never were...
Eating solid breakfasts, Utah?
A little mushy!  You think the taxpayers would like it, Utah, if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls?
Cole and Munoz?  I been on this case for two years.
Harp, let me tell you something.  I was an agent in this bureau when your mommy was still wiping your shinny pink ass, and you know one thing I learned in all those years that you still haven't?
Candle wax.  Car wax.  Mustache wax? Could be anything.  Guy's waxing his mustache at the beach.  Gets sand in it.  Wipes it off with a shoe.  Shoe scuffs the counter.
Angelo, pay attention.  There's gonna be a test afterward.  Lab is showing traces of toxins.  PCBs. Heavy elements... selenium, titanium and arsenic.
... Felony B and E, three months in juvey.  Better.  Felony assault. Postgraduate work at Chino. Excellent.  I'm lovin' it.  What about the brother?  Great!  Another model citizen. These guys really fit the profile.
I'm ready to rock, Angelo.  Where you want me?
Aw shit.
Johnny!  Uh, you, uh... should call first, you know?  Hey, where the hell were you all day?  You gotta at least call in or something.  You okay?
Angelo!  Don't fire!
What do you want?
Gimme a break.  One shrimp and fries to go!  Anything to drink?
What is it?  You all of a sudden got this bug you had to go surfing? This is a line, right?
I can barely do this in broad daylight.
Look at you.
Wasn't my style. We're a rescue unit, not assassins.  This must be good. Big shot from the CIA, leaves his desk to come back to the bush. What's so important?
Our rendezvous points and radio freqs. are indicated and fixed. AWACS contact on four hour intervals.
I knew this man. Green Berets, out of Fort Bragg. What the hell were they doing in here? You got any answers for this, Dillon?
What story did you give to Davis?
We're still too far in, they won't risk coming in for us.
You're wastin' your time.
No way, Dutch. I'm going. You get these people and get the hell out of here.
I'll see you there.
Put him in his poncho and liner and carry him back. We'll bury him in the morning.
I dunno.  Do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress?
We're on the verge of closing a large navy contract.  Double is ridiculous but we can assure you a healthy profit on your shares.  We would give you a promissory note...
Congratulations, sir.
Mr. Kross, I'm not here to sell you my stock.  On the contrary, I'm here to buy yours.
What I did with those companies was perfectly legal.
Mind if I turn on some heat?
Very good.  You ought to have that printed up on your business card.
Ugly habit, biting your nails.
What do you charge for company, Vivian?
Better believe it.
Every place has hookers, but if this hotel has hookers, they don't look like they're...
Send up a bottle of Crystal champagne.
Let's talk some more first.
Good morning.
All right.  How much for the week?
It'd cost you.
And that's the way the game is played.
You're upset, huh?
You liked the guy, though.
Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound.  You don't have to use your brain at all.
You could freeze ice on his wife's ass.  She anything like your ex?
I thought I was the pro.  These women make me feel like an amateur.
You asshole!  I can't believe what a --!
Well, it's true.  Just pay me what you owe me and I'm gone.
What's that?
Edward, I can't.
What if someone tries to steal it?
You mean, besides Elvis?  I'm a human being.  Sure.  Once. First time I ever ran away from home, I got as far as Atlanta. I met this boy.  He'd been with his parents on their way to Chicago.  They stopped at a gas station.  He went to the john. When he came back they'd split. We sorta started looking out for each other.  Aw, he was sweet. And boy, was he good looking, y'know, dark hair and eyes. The chicken hawks were on him all the time.  He hated that. Sometimes we'd find a safe place to crash nights and we'd curl up together and we'd talk about all these crazy things.  The two of us getting married someday. Having kids.  Stupid stuff.
Last time I saw him he was this strong guy.  Now he's beaten. And you <u>liked him</u>.
I got tired of hating my father.
I'll see him alone.  Everyone knows you're my muscle.  We'll make it social.  Tell Kross I'll meet him for dinner.  Tonight if you can arrange it.
Edward, did you hear me?
What time's diner tonight?
I want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now.
Bill, I'd like you to meet Vivian.
She met him at dinner last night... I like this tie.
You're being ridiculous.
Did I wake you?
He wouldn't say.  Edward... I think we got him.  His nuts are on the block and <u>we got him</u>.  You there?
I don't think there's any sense in --
What!?
Hey, hey -- There's a rent.
It's a bit beyond my... range, shall we say.
You'll like it fine.
Then you use your <u>soup spoon</u>.
Miss Vivian --
What is with you?
I'm going to spend <u>money</u>.
Yeah.  Sure.  Why not.  Call me at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.
You never sent the ships. Don't bother lying. It doesn't matter. Westley will come for me anyway.
I killed him myself.
I asked him what was so important for him. "True love," he replied. And then he spoke of a girl of surpassing beauty and faithfulness. I can only assume he meant you. You should bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are.
Farm boy. Polish my horse's saddle. I want to see my face shining in it by morning.
But what if something happens to you?
I told you, "I would always come for you." Why didn't you wait for me?
This will all soon be but a happy memory because Roberts' ship "Revenge" is anchored at the far end. And I, as you know, am Roberts.
Finally, Roberts decided something. He said, "All right, Westley, I've never had a valet. You can try it for tonight. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." Three years he said that. "Good night, Westley. Good work. Sleep well. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." It was a fine time for me. I was learning to fence, to fight, anything anyone would teach me. And Roberts and I eventually became friends. And then it happened.
Oh, Westley, will you ever forgive me?
Frankly, I think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting.
Why should that make such a difference?
I only dog paddle.
I don't think more than ten.
The Man in Black?
Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had?
I brought you a special present.
A book?
Westley didn't reach his destination. His ship was attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who never left captives alive. When Buttercup got the news that Westley was murdered --
You read that wrong. She doesn't marry Humperdinck, she marries Westley. I'm just sure of it. After all that Westley did for her, if she does not marry him, it wouldn't be fair.
I'm telling you you're messing up the story, now get it right!
She will not be murdered. On the day of the wedding, I want the Thieves' Forest emptied and every inhabitant arrested.
Form a Brute Squad then. I want the Thieves' Forest emptied before I wed.
For the last time -- SURRENDER!
-- and then my tongue, I suppose. I killed you too quickly the last time, a mistake I don't mean to duplicate tonight.
I could never cause you grief; consider our wedding off.  You returned this Westley to his ship?
Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour, so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the Princess, make our escape after I kill Count Rugen.
You know, it's very strange -- I have been in the revenge business so long, now that it's over, I don't know what to do with the rest of my life.
No --
What? What?
Look, I'm retired. And besides, why would you want someone the King's stinking son fired? I might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle.
This is noble, sir.  His wife is crippled. His children are on the brink of starvation.
Humiliations galore!
Sorry.
We'll wait until you're ready.
How old were you?
Well, I certainly hope you find him, someday.
I admit it -- you are better than I am.
There's something I ought to tell you.
Making sure nobody's following us.
Stop doing that. We can all relax, it's almost over-
Look! He's right on top of us. I wonder if he is using the same wind we are using.
Well, it's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right -- tch -- over too quickly.
I accept.
You guessed wrong.
The chocolate coating makes it go down easier. But you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency. And you shouldn't go swimming after, for at least, what?
You feeling any better?
Your grandfather's here.
"He wants to croon, he wants to croon,
Oooooooops!
Look at that.  A white Rolls Royce. That's it baby, when you got it, flaunt it.
You have forty-eight seconds left. Hurry.  Hurry.
What is that?  A handkerchief?
They come here.  They all come here. How do they find me?
According to the backer's list you raised $60,000.  But the show you produced only cost fifty-eight thousand.  There's two thousand dollars unaccounted for.
But that's cheating!
Nothing.  Nothing.  Do it.  Do it.
Yes.  Right.  Good thinking.  You figure it out.  I'm tired.  I'm gonna take a little nap.  Wake me if there's a fire.
Yes, what?
What was I saying?
What do you mean?
What did I do?
Oh, you'd go to jail.  If the play were a hit, you'd have to pay off the backers, and with so many backers there could never be enough profits to go around, get it?
Oh, I fell on my keys.  I've got to get out of here.
What can I do?  What can I do? You're getting me hysterical.
Okay ... Max!  And you can call me Leo.
Let me see ... it's such a beautiful day.  Why waste it indoors.  I've got it!  Let's go to Coney Island! We'll lunch at the sea shore.
What kind now, Leo?
I'll tell you what's happening. We've struck gold.  Not fool's gold, but real gold.  The mother lode.  The mother lode.  The mother of them all.
Max, I don't want to take any Siegfried Oath.  I don't know what it is, but I don't want to take it. We might end up in the German Army.
How do you do.  Have you gone mad?  A receptionist that can't speak English.  What will people say?
Max, as I was saying, maybe we should go easy on the spending.  I mean these offices and everything.
But if something should... God forbid... go wrong, at least we could give them some of their money back.  It would look better in court.
So much for Nutsy Fagin.
To failure!
Now ve take the two fuse leads, attach them to the terminals of the conductor and ve're in business.
Plus to minus.  Negative to positive. Male to...
Ulla, I'd like you to meet my partner and associate, Mr. Leo Bloom.
Good.  Good.  We go Motel.
Like clockwork.
Of course, the check, I had it with me all the time.
By the sacred memory...
And last, but not least, Adolph... you know who.
"Deutchland, Deutchland, uber alles, Uber alles in der velt."
Yes.  The actors.  I must destroy the actors.
He's the only cat left that still grooves me.
I always forget to put the sign on, but we do have vacancy.  Twelve in fact. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.
No.
What?
Cash.
I don't know what you expect me to know about... people come and go...
Of course not.
Now, look...!
Sick old women are sharp. Come on, I won't disturb...
Somebody better tell me what's going on and tell me fast! I can take so much and then...
I'm in no mood for trouble!
Sick of the sight of it!  Well, suppose you look around for something that strikes your eyes and meanwhile I'll have my mechanic give yours the once over and... want some coffee? I was just about...
Go ahead! Spin it around the block. Now I know you don't know anything about engine condition, but you can feel, can't you... and it's all in the feel, believe me, you feel that one around the block...
Aha! Always got time to argue money, huh...?
I think you'd better give it a trial spin. Don't want any bad word of mouth about California Charlie.
Isn't Mr. Lowery back from lunch?
Aren't you going to take the pills?  They'll knock that headache out.
Did he say anything about my sister?
Yes?
Is something wrong?
Here?
What thing could we be in together?
Yes... I just... did. The moment they told me...
No. The man whose money she... he talked so loud and fast, and I... I should've called the police.
I need to... I need to believe something. This is the first time I've ever come up against anything I couldn't... understand.
It's been three.
He'll be back. Let's sit still and hang on, okay?
Probably on his way back right now.
Stay here.
Nothing.  Just... all the lights out... must be asleep.
We're going to register. As man and wife. And get shown to a cabin... and then search every inch of that place, inside and... outside.
I wonder where Norman Bates does his hermiting?
We should have asked for Cabin One... The one Mary was in.
Sam, if you owned a useless business like this motel... one you probably couldn't even sell...  what would you need to get away, to start a new business, somewhere else?  Forty thousand dollars?
That's proof Mary was here!  It would be too wild a coincidence for somebody else to...
I've heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels. They say it...
I'm sorry, Mary.  My old Dad used to say 'when you can't change a situation, laugh at it.' Nothing ridicules a thing like laughing at it.
I wish I were. Not an active criminal but... a nice guy with the conscience of a criminal.  Next best thing to no conscience at all.
Not even just to see you, to have lunch... in public?
Mary, whenever it's possible, tax- deductible or not, I want to see deductible you. And under any conditions.  Even respectability.
Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.
Hey, we can leave together can't we?
Dirty night.
I want sleep more than anything. Except maybe, food.
Am I that close to Fairvale?
I'll be in the office if you want anything... just tap on the wall.
Then will you do me a favor?  Will you have supper here?  I was just about to, myself... nothing more than some sandwiches and a lot of milk, but I'd like it if you'd come up to the house and... I don't set a fancy table but... the kitchen's awful homey.
It's a strange hobby. Curious, I mean.
A man should have a hobby.
Is your time so empty?
An Institution? A madhouse?  People always call a madhouse "someplace."  Put her in Someplace!
What do you mean about caring?  Have you ever seen one of those places? Inside? Laughing and tears and cruel eyes studying you... and my mother there?  Why? has she harmed you? She's as harmless as... one of these stuffed birds.
Phoenix?
No, m'am.
Frankly, yes.
We thought, if you didn't mind, we'd go out to the motel with you.
Recluse. Kinder word.
Norman? Sheriff Chambers.  Been just fine, thanks. Listen, we got some worries here. Did you have a man stop out there tonight...  Well, this one wouldn't be a customer, anyway. A private detective, name of...
Barefaced.
I helped Norman pick out the dress she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.
Went out before service.
I'll take you to...
Mother, she's just a stranger!  As if men don't desire strangers, as if... oh, I refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me! You understand, Boy?
Everyone concerned thought... if they could get her to give back the money... they could avoid involving her with the police.
Now wait a minute, Sam. You sure you saw an old woman?
Just before she died she came to--
Why, yes, to you, Mr.--Mr. --what?
Tell me, just what you know of Dr. Meirschultz.
Yes--I can't stand it-- everybody wants papers-- oh, oh 
Fine. Mrs. Buckley will be all right when she gets used to the idea.
What's down there?
Take me down there.
Man, you're crazy. What kind of a place is this?
The child!
There's no child here.
There's no child here, and no dogs either.
There's no hurry. It's early.
Why didn't you eat last night?
You wouldn't get mixed up with that little rotter, would you?
Well, that's just how stupid I am. When you go riding, it will be with me. And if it's with someone else, you can make it a permanent arrangement.
What! What are you talking about?
Are you giving me this straight?
As I live and breathe and wear spats ... the prince.
Charming. More delightful people crippled.
I'm through clowning. You're all washed up. Get out!
All right, what about it? We get out a paper just the same. Did you ever stop to think of that?
And how does one go about getting these human documents, may I inquire?
Well, ain't that a shame. Nice little chappie that wouldn't harm a fly ... everybody picking on the little fellow.
Hey, come here, Sob-sister!
No, there's another point I want to iron out.
Listen, Jo-jo. Does this mean anything to you? Joan Gale's body swiped from the morgue -- Did you ever hear of such a thing as a death mask?
Let it go.
What do you mean?
Was there any art on Judge Ramsey?
You used to go to Worth's place a whole lot. What makes you sure it wasn't there?
No kiddin'.
Don't they? He's down at The Tombs right now.
Nothing. Only she may have tried to blackmail him. You know such things have happened. Anyway, he was at her apartment a few hours before she was found dead.
Make it snappy, Colonel.
Listen, Flo, cut it out. Hard-Tack is pretty sore.
Yeah. I suppose you people will crucify me for something I didn't do.  I didn't! You understand that! ... I didn't do it! She -- tried before -- 
Not even then. The police are the proper people to conduct this affair. Now if you've got any suspicions I'll drive you to the nearest police station.
How much money have you got?
My partner believes that I should build a horror chamber, immortalizing the hideous crimes and criminals of London. At such times Marie Antoinette has reassured me, she has promised me recognition for the devotion I gave to her.
You will have won the undying gratitude of us all.  Is that not so, Marie Antoinette?
I came back for some of the books. I am trying to straighten out the accounts. I don't hope to impress you, but I may as well tell you: We haven't a farthing!
Fire insurance!
I'm not asking you anything. I'm telling you what I'm going to do!
Well, what do you think I'm in this for?  Think of it, man, a match -- a cigar stub -- and ten thousand pounds to divide between us!
And he isn't struck dead! This man, he lives! It would be interesting to know, young man, where and when you studied anatomy.
I will only be gone about half an hour.
I wouldn't feel too disappointed at the slimness of your audience tonight, Mr. Igor. The weather was against you, and the people are tired and getting over their celebration and preparing to go to work tomorrow.
What are you laughing at?
Don't waste it Pauly.  This is not an everyday talk.  Just input the information and ask relevant questions.  One: how did a celebrated life of the mind bring me  to this particular switching station?
Could we go somewhere?
Why am I doing this?
She's in L.A., he's in the Bay area --
They're filthy, Mother.
Lots of things. Buddy, mostly.
But who were they?
Was that what they tried to do? Was that why Daddy gave you the job, to save you from those scoundrels?
Hey, Rose, did you hear about that terrible thing down in Cave Springs?
I don't hear you. I just turn my back on that kind of talk and look away.
I thought I'd go crazy back there in that room all by myself with nobody to talk to. As a child, I never had no room all to myself, we were awful poor. Buddy... I have got a confession to make.
Promise not to tell Doll? -- or nobody? Buddy, it's your Daddy! I'm so much in love with him I am out of my mind!
All right, that's enough.  You're just a child and wouldn't understand it, but that type of thing can stir a girl up. Now lie back and we'll talk.
Of course you can't! I'm... I'm shocked at you, Buddy, real shocked! Now you be quiet or I'm going back to my own bed!
I must be outta my mind. Buddy, quit it.
Did you know when I was a child we had pretty near five hundred rabbits?
Boy did I get sick of rabbit. But later on after Momma died and Daddy wasn't doin' nothin' but drinkin', I sure would of been glad for a little rabbit stew. You know, I oughtn't to of told you about what Daddy done when I was a child. Until them rabbits ruined him, he was a real good man, Buddy.
Of course not!
You were up late last night, Brother.
What do you think, Brother?
Well. Well, what I mean is, you could prove it was his shoes if you did catch him. But look this, Brother, it is even more interesting. Look at this mark here, and that mark over there. Now wouldn't you say those marks are the marks of a ladder?
I heard you talking. Hasn't Rose come in?
Uhhh, gahdam stuff!
Excuse me, gotta go to bathroom.
I think she's gonna kiss him.
Wow! Brrrother!
He had his hand on her titty.
Buddy, that was pretty snotty of you, pushing me away like that just when it was interesting.
So am I.
A baby... and she isn't even married.
I can use a drink after the plane ride I had.
All right, Daddy. We have our drink, we're out on the patio, you have prepared me for it. Rose's cancer has come back, hasn't it?
Well, you have knocked me for a hell of a loop, old man. A hell of a loop.
Why Rose? Why Rose, Daddy?
Well, it's a disaster. I don't know what to say, Doctor, I am floored. How dangerous is the operation?
How goes it, darlin'?
Well, I'll admit I don't see any flies on her yet.
I'll drive you, darlin'. You've got no business behind the wheel of an automobile. You don't think about what you're doing and you'll run into a telephone pole.
I don't think you understand her. It isn't sex she wants, it's love she wants and this is the only way she knows how to get it.
But that's a wonderful quality, not a bad quality.  Have a little patience with her. She's such a good-hearted little thing and tries so hard.
Why shouldn't she go out and have boyfriends?
Well, it isn't Rose's fault boys and men like her. You cant blame her for that, hon.
Now you listen to me, Rose --
She hasn't actually done anything...
Her plan is obvious, plain as day. She's going on a hunger strike. The question is, how do we foil her?
I don't know how you can call it ideal -- don't you know what the word "farm" means to her?
It sounds like a farm to me. Calling it a dairy establishment, that's just trickery and flummery.
She already told you, she doesn't know.
Rose isn't oversexed, that's ridiculous. If you're going to talk nonsense, I don't want to talk to you at all. Rose is exactly the same as the rest of us, except more so.
Yes, sir.
All right, all right. Now calm down, Rose, the children will hear you. Calm down, let's talk... about this thing, let's discuss it.
Rose, what are you doing up?
You're so sweet.
That's a pretty stylish skirt, Rose. The only thing I don't understand is how did you ever get it on.
Strange voices, Rose?
Ohhh-hh, ohhh...
I didn't mean to bite him. He was hitting Horton with a blackjack in the meanest way and... and I bit him accidental.
Ahh-hh, you'll like it. It's a fine, outdoor-type job.
What baby? What baby? What baby are you speaking about?
Your baby?
Rose... I hate to be mean, but...  Oh, nevermind, forget it.
Excuse me... your voice is familiar and I'm sure I know you from somewhere...
Well, I... I... ah-h, let's see...
Galley what?
Afraid of the hospital?
A tenant farm? Are you trying to tell me that girl is a product of the hookworm and pellagra belt?
I'm not surprised you thought she was pregnant. An ovarian cyst can look very much like pregnancy. But it was pure wishful thinking on her part. The girl can never have children, she had gonorrhea at fifteen and it was untreated.
I understand you perfectly. You leave that girl alone, you wretched man, or you will be sorry.
When he was baby we called him "Wa Wa," a baby name, you know. You will find him a very good boy. His brother can be bad and so can his sister, but Waski is a very good boy. And as you can see he's beautiful.
It must be wonderful to be so smart. I don't see how you do it, reading all those books, learning all that stuff.
Rose has learned her lesson, haven't you, Rose?
Rose, you don't have to.
You'll never guess what happened!  I have met Mr. Right! I been with him all day and he loves me, I know he does, he loves me and he's going to marry met Be's practi'cly ast me already!
I... I can explain...
How much?
Take her down to the car, and for Christ's sake be careful this time.  Last suspect he took in, butter-fingers dropped her down the stairs.  What a mess.  Why is it we don't appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
Well, I'm running out of trees, so look me in the eye like a man and tell me you don't know!  Convince me!
What do you want?  I'm clean.  I been clean a long time.
Know what he's doing, Benny?  He's trying to jog your memory.
Nothing, I guess.  Just an observation.  She's really something special.  You're a lucky fella.
Give a Hoot.  Don't Pollute.
Remember those two uniform cops who been giving us such a hard time... ?
Wh... what... ?!
I don't know what the problem is. Plenty of great men throughout history got their bravery out of a bottle
They... they shot me.
It doesn't say that.
Smooth move, hot-shot.
I can't believe we're stealing.
Don't talk like that.  There's plenty of women around for jerks like you.
What about Jack Daniels?  Wasn't he a decorated general in the Civil War?
Feels like there's a bullet still in my chest.
He tried to kill us.
He went to pick up lunch.
And, what... what am I forgetting? Oh, yes... the transvestite junkie whose bullet riddled body came blasting through the front doors of the precinct house!
Couldn't have said it better myself.
Just 'cause you belong to some fancy-pants club, doesn't make you any less a murderer.
I just think you should show some respect.  I mean, call me old fashioned, but 200 years ago when Ben Franklin and those guys signed the Constitution and Declaration of Independence, they did that so we could all share in the freedom...
Alright?
We got him.
Hold your horses, sweetpea.  We need Butch Cassidy alive, remember?
That's not true.
Hey-Ho... !  Maybe we're not alone in this thing after all.
This much powder you don't throw in the trunk with a blanket over it. It's got to be smuggled.
No more counting the big money for someone else.
You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.
The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
Jabba's palace.
The Death Star will be completed on schedule.
Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things.
Vader's on that ship.
Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.
Hey!
Lando, grab it!
Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.
It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
Good luck.
What are you telling them?
Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?
All wings report in.
There it is!
Tell me.
He's my father.
Yes. It's you Leia.
Then you know why I have to face him.
Yoda, I must know.
Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...
Yes or no will do.
Do you have any tattoos Brad.
He was a Science Teacher at Denton High.
Janet!
Janet.
Yes Brad.
Gosh.  That's the third motorcyclist that's passed us.  They certainly take their lives in their hands.  What with the weather and all.
Oh Brad, I'm frightened.  What kind of place is this?
Brad, please lets get out of here.
But it seems so unhealthy here.
I'm Brad Majors and this is my fiancee, Janet Vice.
Oh, I hope so my darling.  But let me switch on the light.
I could see Brad's face before me and my mind screamed No!  But my lips were hungry - too hungry.
I wanted to be loved completely. My body throbbed excitedly.  Oh Brad, Brad my darling, how could I have done this to you?
Hello.
Great scott - Scotty - Dr Everett Scott.
Well.    I don't like men with...er, with too many, muscles.
What guy
Was all I had to say
Wheeling
Oh, no no, no no.
No no no, no no.
Creature of the night.
Our noble mission is almost completed my most beautiful sister, soon we will return to the moon-drenched shores of our "androgenous" planet.
But it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane.
Me, I'm kinda aggravated.
What's funny?
...Guess.
Here's the guys I was tellin' ya about -- This is Cuff an' Link.
It's okay.
Would ya take off your glasses?
...T-thank you.
How'd ya like hearin' ya name on TV?
Y'know how I said that stuff on television didn't bother me?
Really -- You don't think they're overly feminine?
Can't fool around -- You look very great.
What did you say about a pet shop?
...I can't beat him.
It ain't so bad, 'cause I was a nothin' before --
No... I can't!
Oh, Rocky!
He won't last one round.
...That man's takin' his job too serious.
Damn.
'The Italian Stallion' -- He's my man.
How was the flight, Champ?
Apollo, how would you rate this last British challenger, Henry Wilcoxson?
Take 'er to the zoo -- Retards like the zoo.
I don't like ya face.
Seven minutes!
Cost ya a buck.
We would like to welcome our viewing audience to the Grand World Championship Bicentennial Heavyweight Fight -- the first major event of the Bicentennial Year... A point of interest is that the fight is being beamed to more than seven hundred and fifty million fans in theatres in nearly every corner of the world. I would like to welcome an old friend, and co-commentator for this evening's event -- Jimmy Michaels.
If you had asked anyone who knows boxing, they never would've predicted a first round knockdown and the second round punishment to the body of the Champion... Most fighters will tell you, receiving a good body punch is the next worst thing to dying.
A hundred an' thirty.
Ya still light seventy.
Yo Rock. Did I give you a job this mornin? How come ya didn't break this guy's thumb like I asked ya? When ya don't do what ya are told, it makes me look bad, kid.
Buddy's got a thing against ya, Rock. Some people just hate for no reason, y'know.
Here's fifty bucks -- You an' the girl have a nice time.
Listen, kid, I'm with ya. Ya know, I'm with ya -- Italian, we're blood. You kill this rug -- We Guinneas gotta show these Afro-Americans where it's at. Give it your best shot cause I want ya to prove to these bums on the corner that my man can't be beat by this rug... Ya got any action on the side.
Ya gettin 150 grand killer. Ya got any plans for it? Whatta ya think? Ya like to put it on the street, make it work for ya?
Hello, Mr. Balboa -- I'm Miles Jergens -- Please, have a seat.
I'm sure you are.
Did these guys teach you to talk dirty? Huh?
Hey! When I was your age, there was only one girl who talked like that in the whole neighborhood.
Makes your breath like garbage.
Nobody likes garbage -- Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin', but the guys wouldn't take her out for any serious datin'.
What was I gonna say?
Do you see me talkin'? Huh?
Did ya win?
Did ya get the message, kid?
A Rep from Miles Jergens' Promotions was lookin' for ya -- They need sparrin' partners for Creed.
Here's the card?
Whatta' those?
Nobody ever said that -- There's his picture.
Ya nose is broke.
Gimme the water! Ya gettin' tagged with his right. I think you should feint left and high hook 'im -- Benny, check the eyes! Can ya see?
You were ready to bite that guy's face.
No more, ya wanna lose an eye? No more.
Yo, Paulie.
Yeah, like I was a plate of leftovers -- Somethin' wrong with my face -- Whatta I need, a Caddy to connect with ya sister?
Hey --
What kinda business?
It don't bother me none.
I got whiskey here.
If ya don't pay Gazzo, ya end up hangin' on the hook, right?
Outta my house I want ya!!
This is your largest payday ever -- How do you feel about it?
Oh, a ladies man, huh?
Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
Is this paper even good?
He's a riot.
Maybe they just took it out of his pocket.
I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate.
Being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective.  What were you looking for, Mr. Valiant?
I ain't tellin' you nothin'!  Get me Santino.
You're a pig... a happy-go-lucky pig.
Does it hurt?
How much do you know about show business, Valiant?
You don't have to.  The rabbit's wife sings at an underground Toon revue joint called The Ink & Paint Club.  You can catch her in action there.
Hi, Mr. Maroon.  Remember me?
You're not too good at this, are you, R.K.?
Look, pal, if you're still here when I finish this drink, I'm callin' the police.
If you're so innocent, why'd you run?
But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.
You wanna know?  Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of you Toons killed my brother.
Yeah, everybody thought so.  But me and Teddy got a kick out of Toons.  All Toons.  We couldn't see the bad in 'em. And when this guy was accused of knockin' over the First National Bank of Toontown, we took his case.  But when we looked into it, we found out he did do it after all.  We went to his house to take him in.  But he was wise. He got the drop on us... literally.
Gee, Eddie, you're not gonna go, are ya?  Maroon'll be layin' for ya at nine o'clock.
Real good, Rog... but maybe you better let me take over.
No better?
Live and be prosperous; and farewell good fellow.
Romeo! Romeo!
Why that pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline. Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
Thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Verona.
Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate, O anything of nothing first create. heavy lightness. Serious vanity. Misshapen chaos of well seeming forms.
Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
Out of her favour, where I am in love.
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
What dares the slave Come hither, To fleer and scorn at our solemnity? Now, by the stock and honour of my kin, To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.
Such mortal drugs I have, but Verona's law is death to any that utters them.
My poverty, but not my will consents.
Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here! Is Rosaline that thou didst love so dear so soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes.
O God. Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood? O serpent heart hid with a flowering face. Was ever book containing such vile matter's so fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell in such a gorgeous palace.
[Within] Juliet!
O honey nurse, what news? Nurse?
I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well. Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this; For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
He jests at scars that never felt a wound. But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun. Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, Who is already sick and pale with grief, That thou her maid art far more fair than she: Be not her maid, since she is envious; Her vestal livery is but sick and green And none but fools do wear it; oh cast it off. It is my lady, O, it is my love! O, that she knew she were!
She speaks: O, speak again, bright angel!
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
Romeo. What's here? Poison. Drunk all, and left no friendly drop to help me after. I will kiss thy lips. Happily some poison yet doth hang on them. Thy lips are warm.
By my count, I was your mother much upon these years, You are now a maid. Thus then in brief: The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
Why, may one ask?
Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
Why, then is my pump well flowered.
A Plague o' both your houses.
Follow me close. Gentlemen, gooday. A word with one of you?
Mercutio! Thou art consortest with Romeo?
Nurse.
This is important.
Why did you do that?
You go shoot me if you want, Vincent, but you'll be dead before I hit the ground.
So what's the deal?
Then Swede and I split with the package and meet you back at the rendezvous.
This...this is incredible. Is the rest of Europe like this?
Oh yeah?  Whatta you drink, then?
And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus Reilly?
Problem my ass!  I think you're lying to me, and if you are you're a dead man!
What in bloody hell is going on?
About time!
Hazard pay...
I still am.
And when I consider that, I have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.
Look, Sam, don't take it the wrong way when I tell you we won't be doing this again.
I know I don't have to, Sam, it's just that, for once, I want to.  when I was a -  Patriot, it was a given I'd sleep with any man it was deemed necessary for me to sleep with.  You know: any man who needed setting up.  Sometimes so we might blackmail him, sometimes so he could be killed.  Sometimes so I could kill him myself. IRA isn't exactly an enlightened feminist organization, Sam.  To most of the men I with I was always the girl.  "Send the girl to do it."  "Tell The girl to take care of it."  "Have the girl fuck him."  But I look at you and I get this feeling you take me for what I am: no more, no less.
Now, what did we steal?
Well, if it isn't Mr. Interpol himself.  I can't believe I misjudged you like I did.
Where do you get off saying word one? All the time pretending to be one of us, it's the same thing we were doing, Seamus and myself.  And here you are so high and mighty, like you're so different from the rest of us.
Who are you?  IRA?
Alright, Gregor, I'm...
Sit, sit...  Would you like one?
Don't talk to me unless you tell me what I want to hear, understand?!?  You have no choice in this, don't think about winning, think about staying alive.  I want the item, and if you don't give it to me, I'm gonna kill you.
Gregor, is that you?
So what do we do?
I would imagine that the great satisfaction in all of this will be killing the American.
Nobody's going to do that!
What're you talking about, man?  I don't understand.
You should watch what you eat.
Is that right?
I don't particularly like killing, tubby, but I want you to know that this one I'm going to enjoy.
Sorry I'm late...
I'm Vincent.  And I coordinate.
Pretty much what you'd expect.
What'd you say to him?
Exactly.  Why not bring them?
I came up here to sneak a smoke.
We live in a singular world, my friend.
He's going back.
Fix it yourself?  Why are we even doing this?  There's no need to run, Christ...  You're a cop.
And what job is that?
It isn't about money for me, not anymore.
Alright, it's done.
You sure your friend got the right place?
You would have done that?
Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!
Would you stop with that...
You have to stop doing that!
Let's get him out of here...
You son-of-a-bitch...
"Your field dressing saved his life." That's three I owe you.
I know.
Don't spend it all in one place.
How old is Otis anyhow, thirty?
What the hell...
Ten thousand right here.
What are we going to do?
We don't know that.
Well someone's gonna find them.
It's no accident we stumbled on this money.  It's an answer to a prayer!  Every night and every day I've prayed that God would just -- help me out a little, give me a little push.  Tonight my prayer came true.
We'll leave a few packets in the trunk, and stash the rest somewhere else.  Car went up in the gunfight.
I've got one condition.
Okay then.  I'll do it.
We're dead.  We're dead, We are dead...  What are we going to do?!
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
Shit!  We're gonna have to get rid of him.  I'm not letting some gangbanger ruin my life.  We can't risk it.
And how do you figure we do that?
You said that last time!
Well what are we supposed to do?
You're crazy.
Do you have everything?
I don't know for sure, but why else would they head for the bank?
We're not?  How do you figure that?
What happened?  What's Earl doing here?
Dwayne's dead.
What are you talking about?
That'll bring me down, too. Eventually.  You gotta know that.
I understand your logic, Booth, but I don't think...two thousand's going to raise any eyebrows, do you?
How are ya?
Yeah?  So?
Hi.
Nothing's wrong.
Sally?  I was beginning to think he wasn't gonna leave.
And I'd end up a widow in two ways.  Let's forget it.  I'll just be a little more careful next time.
You're worth every last penny.
So do I.
A satellite dish?
I don't know, Booth.
When do you expect this inheritance stuff to be straightened out?
Test the product?
Why?
Sheriff Hogan --
Yeah.
Anything I can help you with?
I have an anniversary coming up, thought I'd buy her something special.
She's not his type.
You walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich.
Where's the hot back -- the therapeutic pad thing?
Nothing.  Nothing's the matter. SALLY Aren't you going to tell how your day went?
Well you might as well say it. Mister Small Time...
Dwayne please calm down!
Hey we're all friends, right? Friends don't squeal on friends, that's not what Jesse Segundo is all about.
I'm not asking.
Well what do you know!  An air conditioner.
Not in the trunk.
Yeah, we did.  It was unleaded, high octane.
That fire was set.  Deliberately. And probably not by anyone found at the scene.
This isn't right...
Is it true, Carter?  Are you in Hong Kong right now?
Did you give me five-hundred dollar chips because I'm black?
You assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll, is that right?  Are you a racist?
Winner six!
Wait.
Look, I need some info and I don't have time to play around.
How'd you know?
I knew it.  The guy's name is Zing.  He works at the kitchen at Reign Plaza.
Called?  What's my ship called?  Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson.
You see, no bomb.  Now stay away before I throw you both in jail for obstruction.
Look, I've been working this case for months now...
Could you have your partner wait for us outside?
You bring American money?
Wait a second.  You're Steven Reign? You're big time.  You own all them big hotels.  What are you doing in Hong Kong?
You're right, you're a smart guy.  Most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar.  But this is an even swap.  Pure genius.
Just relax and don't worry about a thing.  I'll hook you up in there.  You got condoms?
Carter, get off that stage!
What'd I say?
You lied to me.
I'm telling you right now, I'm tired of this shit.  There's two billion Chinese - let one of them be your partner.
And that's how you use the LAPD choke hold.  Now start practicing and don't make me come back here!
Hello.
Where are you going?
Fine.  Go home.  Who needs you.
It's my job!
You.
Five years ago, my father was Chief Inspector working a big international smuggling case.
All the evidence against him disappeared, the smuggling case was unsolved.  Tan resigned and went over to the Triads openly.
You want to figure out why they killed your Daddy, get on the plane.
Follow the Rich White Man?
She's getting undressed.
No.  It's not right.
She's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg.  Oh, God...please don't let it be a dick.
Get it out of here!
Fine with me.
Fine.
I think we should stop talking.
How was the sex?
Are you serious?
That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims?
Very nice.
Hello, Benjamin.
Red Dragon.
That looks exactly like my Uncle Darrell.
Isabella?  Are you crazy, man?  She almost got us killed.  She's setting you up again!
I'll go to the craps table, make a big scene.  When security comes over, you make your move.
Lee!
I saw that.  She kissed you, didn't she? You played it cool, though.  Walking away, never looking back.
I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you're off this case.  I don't ever want to see you again, you got that?
Put your arms around me.
I'm asking for real now -- will you help the Secret Service?
Are you okay?
Do you still have the bills?
Lee, there was a bombing at the American Embassy.  Two American translators were killed.
Lee, this is Special Agent Sterling from the United States Secret Service.
All he wanted was some mu-shu.
Lee, we just got a call from the harbor patrol.  Ricky Tan is throwing a little party on his boat tonight.  Victoria harbor.  If you don't want to...
Despite what people suspect...what you suspect --
He was the best I ever trained, you know.
A seeding spends its entire life reaching towards Heaven.
The answers you seek can be found in Heaven on Earth.
Two Americans have been killed on United States Government property -- this is our investigation.
You don't move, you understand?!  You don't move!
Lee!  It's him!
Fifty million!  Are we talkin' United States dollars?
I don't know what went wrong last night, but this department could've lost one detective and our only explosives expert.
And that, of course, would be me.
Bullshit a little.  You lied to me.
I am afraid I don't understand the importance of this information.
That silly-ass look on your face.
Where were we?
You're a regular god damn acrobat, aren't you?  Bet you feel real good makin' me look like an asshole.
What about them?
I worked with Ambassador Han and his family for ten years.  He wanted me to come with them to America.  If I had, this might not have happened.
I also did not come because I think I would not fit in America.
Alright, listen, no bullshit just tell me straight: did you really know the guy you were chasin'?
When we go inside, you let me handle everything, you hear?  This is my man, you dig?  My informant. You know what an informant is?
You see what I'm sayin'? You control the space.
You like it?
Like that.
No, please, I don't --
No, wait.  I don't have it.  You have it.
What are you doing here?
Oh no.
What a surprise!
Not anymore.
Hey, baby, it's cool.  Captain just reassigned me to the Feds.
In Charge.  Just me'n him.  No interference.  They don't even want to hear from us until we're done.  I love the F.B.I.  I love the F.B.I.
You made a fool out of me! In front of the FBI!
This is my city. I'm a cop. I'll find Œem.
Oh my god...what happened to you?
You don't like it?
Yeah. So why you look do down?
Any demands yet?
... the director considers this top priority, considering he is a Chinese National and here under difficult circumstances.  His name is Lee.  And he is to be shown every courtesy. Within reason.
Yo, Johnson...
Hello.
Yes.
Hello.
And Mr. Lee?  Where is he?
I don't believe you.  My father was explaining to Mr. Griffin.  That is how I found out.
What is he up to now?
Bob -- are you making friends with this man?
What do you expect me to say to this?
You look awful.
I'm really sorry that I hurt you, Brian.
Of course.
That's it.  Back to obedience school.
Tell me, why does Maggie need another wedding rehearsal and two days before the wedding?  She's already done this.
I didn't cook up a story.  I had a source.
Fisher, let him talk.
Is that what I did to you?  Is that what happened?  Did I just not see you?
In vino veritas.
Vindication.  How would you like to get some?  A chance to prove that, though your facts weren't entirely straight, your theory was correct.
The anatomy of the black widow spider of Maryland.
Okay, we'll order out.
Of course we are.  Of course.
Get this man a Kamikaze.
You could have told me you were fiance number three.
Have you listened to his morning show, "Wake up with ballplayer"?
You should thank Lou and I for the wedding car -- a '63 Buick.
I hope you have a different angle. It's pretty much all been covered.
You've been here for three minutes. What did you do to her?
Too much.
I think so.
Maybe someday.
No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe someday.
It's a little "Silence of the Lambs" for me.  I can't believe you waited for the wedding to run.
No.  I think I said something eloquent like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know.  What do you think?"
I don't know.
Tell me.  When you get to the altar, will you spike the bouquet?
I don't know, give me a minute.  Are you all right with this?
I already explained about that.
No.  No -- Actually, let's make Ike the pastor.
About a minute...?
Okay.  So... what, uh... What just happened?  Just now?  Jus then?  In there?
Yes, you!
And the church.
Yes, I did.
Okay, he's on base.  Can we talk about my life now?  -- Ike's going to turn that tattoo stuff into a big deal -- that I was never serious about Gill, blah blah.  He's totally out to get me.
That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.
Good morning to you, too.  You look good.
Because you think I'm all like... "Hey man, check me out".
You're right.  It's not funny now. Maybe we both grew up.
So I've come to see it as a bonus, really, that we've been able to plan, and pay for, so many weddings.
I'm not exactly having fun, either... Steady.
His name is Skipper, Dad... Steady.
Maggie, it's just a joke...
"What is unusual about Miss Carpenter is that she likes to dress her men up as grooms before she devours them.  She has already disemboweled six in a row by leaving them at the altar."... I can't ready anymore.
No, no.  You're her best friend.
There's no why, Annie.  I'm just not up for it.  I never said I was.
How about ... you're too narcissistic to commit to another human being in a long- term way.
Am I what they had in mind?
If he eats one tiny piece of a nut --
They loved you.  I told you they would love you and they did.
Happy New Year, darling.
We will?  The Symphony?  Okay.  I'll take you to the Russian Tea Room for pelmeni.
It's delicious, trust me.
About forever.
Walter.
Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It was just...
What's with you?
And now 2,000 women want his number.  The guy could be a crackhead, a psychopath, a flasher, a junkie, a transvestite, a chain-saw murderer, or someone really sick, like Rick.
You want to hear about destiny? If my husband hadn't gone on a diet, which caused me to leave him, I would never have been on that flight to Miami, and met Rick, and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a 727 with that nob you slide that says "vacant-occupied, vacant- occupied, vacant-occupied" -- 
Men never get this movie.
Did you talk to him?
Okay.  Good.  Goodbye.
No.  That's the weirdest part about it.
This is a photo of hair.
"Dear Annie: Thanks for your letter.  It was great.  We're very excited about meeting you in New York on Valentine's Day and seeing if we are M.F.E.O. Sleepless in Seattle."
What about the letter?
You're going to miss the train.
Maybe you should see a shrink.
I'm Jonah.  That's my dad.  His name is Sam.
I think I'm going crazy, Tom. I really do.  Are you happily married?
I know, I know.  I do not want to move to Seattle.  But what I really don't want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing I could have done something. What do you think?  It's just cold feet, isn't it? Everyone panics before they get married, didn't you?
I notice these things are back in fashion.  Oh, honey.  He's a lovely man, Annie.
It's silly, really.  I mean, I'd seen him at the office, obviously I'd seen him, he's the associate publisher, and then one day we both ordered sandwiches from the same place, and he got my lettuce and tomato sandwich on whole wheat, which of course he was allergic to, and I got his lettuce and tomato on white.
Sure you do.
I'm probably not interested in whatever you're selling.
Who is this?
It's been about a year and a half.
No.
When's the latest time you were out there?
Write her.
Do you want a fruit plate?
Dad --
No, I'm not, but --
Does red pepper go under R or P?
I'm sorry.  I'm just --
How did they get our phone number?
Somewhere in the middle.
This is not how you do it.  You want this on an English muffin or a bun?
But not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you're halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it's just a drink, if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you don't you can go home if you see what I mean.  I wonder if it still works this way.
If you get a new wife, I guess you'll have sex with her, huh?
Will she scratch up your back?
Jed's got cables.
It was sinking.
I... uh... have a date with someone Friday night.
Her name is Annie.  Annie Reed.
Jonah!
What are you doing up?
There's a bathroom upstairs.
Long enough to call Victoria a ho.
God, she's beautiful.
I'm not leaving this room until you say yes.
Listen, have I ever done anything really stupid?
Hi.
Yes?
Five minutes in the microwave. Any one of them, five minutes and done.  Ready to eat.  Do you know how to make juice?
Oh.
I told you it would happen. It's bound to happen when a man works alone!
You're welcome to one.
He says give 'em equality. Equality in jobs, equality in the home. Also sex equality.
Who? A scab?
Can we light the candles now? On the cake?
Was it expensive, the beer?
Mother of God ...have mercy ...
Let them take it!
I don't want your dead body. I don't want you back in jail either.
Alone?
Ramón -- you can't.
Whose funeral? We're doing all right. There hasn't been a scab near the picket line for three days.
Charley's my friend. I need friends.  Why are you afraid to have me as your friend?
We can't think of them just as housewives -- but as allies. And we've got to treat them as such.
Don't horse me. Price of zinc's never been higher. They don't want no strike -- not with their war boom on.
Go on. Spill it.
No. New York.
What are you doing here?  Something wrong with Mama?
Papa, can't I leave now? There's a meeting of the Junior Shop Stewards ...
But Papa -- you need all the help you can get.
Ramón ... listen to me ... I'm in a	jam ... I had to get a job ...
Bobby?
What?
They were wearing ski masks. I told you all of this.
Look...I'd like to help you out ... but I really don't want to get involved.
Why don't you call the cops?
Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure.  By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set.  Where's Quincey?
Is that how you play?
You've got a comeback for everything, don't you, Danny? You use 'em like some sort of shield.
We been through that.
What's wrong, Danny?
Will you do that?  Then I want you to get out of the room.
What time is it?
My features. They're Finnish.
So, why'd you want to see me?
Why do they call him Pooh-Bear?
You're going to have to explain that one.
Okay
But... why? Why would you pretend?
By not disgracing her memory!
You're serious?
Maybe you're the one who isn't taking me seriously.
I welcome you here with open arms and you got the nerve to low-ball me like some slick used car salesman.
Now get talkin'
What the hell is this?
No last name?
You think I'm a Judas?
Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit.
Thanks for not judging me.
You don't find that repugnant?
Look, we'll talk to the A.D.A.
I was trying to score some dope.
Well, if you'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande ...
Bullshit. He's a liar.
What? Is it bad?
That's real sweet, Garcetti.  Thanks.
This the guy?
We know what's going on.
What's on the other end of this thing?
Who'd have thought it?  Danny "Chickenshit" Flynne trying to go large right under our noses.
Speaking of which ... you run that license plate for me?
A virtuoso rendition.  TOM VAN ALLEN is nothing short of dazzling in his interpretation of Miles Davis' haunting, moody piece.
Just make sure you hit the floor when we come in. It could get ugly in there.
Find a chaplain.
Casualties?
Pinned down, a mile east of here, waiting for some help from the navy guns.
But, sir...I...I...
Good luck, John.
As a matter of fact, I am.
I don't make jokes about things of, or related to, the preaching of the Holy Gospel, including the ministerial calling of my family.
Did you see what he did, back there? He stepped right into the open, so I could get across.
What do you think?
No kiddin'?
Reiben, I want you to listen closely to Jackson.  This is the way to gripe. Jackson, continue.
Where?
Watching.
You see, I've got the best house in all of Addley.  It's not the biggest house, but it's got the best location, right next to the junior high baseball field.  The garage windows face left field.  The guy who owned the house before me had these heavy screen S put over them.  The first thing I did when I bought the place was take off those screens.  Two-hundred-twenty- two yards from home plate to my garage windows.  It takes a hell of a junior high kid to hit a ball that far.  I look at my garage windows as a Motivator and a way to scout the kids coming up, the ones who are going to give us a shot at the state championship.  I lay there in my hammock and every time I hear the sound of breaking glass, I know we're one step closer to winning it all.
It's worth it.
I know about bracketing.  I read about it.  The next one is going to land right on us.
The men said, nine.
GO!
Worked, didn't it?
He's right, Captain, it might be kind of dangerous for those flyboys.
Command isn't going to let them withdraw and the Germans sure as hell aren't going to let them surrender.
I hope this boy Ryan is worth it.
A couple of weeks.  It started in Portsmouth when they brought us down for loading.
Yeah?  What rule of thumb is that?
How about...?
What was the name of that kid at Anzio, the one who got his face burned off?
She's the best poker player you ever saw.  My father used to go to these Saturday night games and lose his shirt.  Finally, my mother gave him an ultimatum, either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every Saturday night. He squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down, she never lost.  She could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands.  And he bluffs?  He had sixteen levels of bullshit.  Her eyes, the tone of her voice, her bets, her jokes, the way she sipped her coffee, she was a master.  She won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game. Every Saturday night, my father would lose two, three hundred bucks and she'd win it all back and then some. And I'd stand there, glued to her shoulder, from the time I was five years old, watching every hand, every move, studying how she did it.  That's why I'm such a good officer, I can look at a man's face and tell you exactly what he's holding, and if it's a shit hand, I know just what cards to deal him.
No problem.  A pair of deuces?  Less? So what?  I bluff.  It used to tear me apart when I'd get one of my men killed, but what was I supposed to do?  Break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do?  Of course not, so I bluffed, and after a while, I started to fall for my own bluff. It was great, it made everything so much easier.  Sarge Is that why your hand's been shaking?
And how do you bluff yourself?
John, I've got to tell you, I think you're about used up.
Sarge, see what you can do to make those buildings inhospitable.
What do you think?
What are we going to do?
Uh, oh.
Captain, can I put in for a transfer?
Reiben, how the hell do you know so much about lingerie?
I should be on my way to Caen, sir. It's like Beethoven, the guy's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf.  Go figure, I mean, who'd he piss off?  And here I am, the Beethoven of ladies foundation garments, one step away from Caen, the center of the known lingerie universe and instead, I'm going to Ramelle to save some fucking private who's probably already dead.
I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir.  It's a personal thing.
In addition, as I pointed out earlier, I have a fondness for cheese and I hope to have the opportunity to sample some of the Ramelle products, when we arrive there, to see if they live up to their excellent reputation. Moreover, I feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of Private James Ryan and I'm more than willing to lay down my life, and the lives of my men, especially you, Reiben, to help relieve her suffering.  The men thoroughly enjoy the performance.
Any further thoughts on the subject?
Sir, I've got an idea, let's go around.
Maybe Caen.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
What deal?
Continues FIRING.  CUTTING DOWN the advancing Germans.
Private.  I'm sorry about your brothers but staying here and getting yourself killed isn't going to help.
Don't do that again.
Hell, I don't mind this mission, sir, as long as there's something up at Ramelle for...
So, where are you from?
How do you do it?
You're trying to get me to say something, that's why you're telling me all of this.
Hmmm.  Your income, Mr Court, hasn't changed substantially in seventeen years.
Hi.
I'll take the whole set.
Thanks, I like yours too.
You're tough, J-man.
That's not even a scam.
Yes.
Did you see what Mr Carroll wrote in my yearbook?  Well, he ridiculed me all year long, and then he writes, "You're a real live-wire, Love Mr Carroll."  Y'know, it's all so phoney.
Lloyd, it's us.
"Dear Diane, I'll always be there for you, all the love in my heart, Lloyd."  I've never gotten a letter like this, have you?
That was a mistake.  The rain on my car is a baptism.  The new me.  Iceman, power Lloyd.  My assault on the world begins now. Believe in myself, answer to no one... You probably got it all figured out, Corey.  If you start out depressed, everything's kind of a pleasant surprise.
Visit her at the home.
You like it?
God, that's... this is ridiculous.
Morning honey.
Dad, you and I have talked about this.  Lloyd and I have talked about this.  Believe me, this is well-covered territory.
Dad, in a million years, I would never give him a pen.  What's wrong with having some fun?  I like him.
Honey!
Honey, about what?
No, you don't know what it is.  It's not for me.  This money's for you, for when you come back from England with honors to set you up, so you don't have to depend on anybody again.  Diane, I take better care of these people than their families do.  I care for them, I give them flowers, I feed them, I wipe their mouths...
I made their lives better.
Mom, please?
You will?
Yeah.  I read about your fellowship in the paper, and I'm very glad you called me back.
Yeah.  I just wanted to congratulate you on your scholarship to England, and I wanted to tell you that I thought your speech was really incredible.
Whoah, what a day, huh?
What about tonight then, are you going to that party at Valhere's?
Actually, I think that I...
What are these?
He does this every year?
Have a good sleep.
Then call me tomorrow.
Me?  Sure I do.
Okay, bye.
Don't worry about it.  We're just having coffee.  We'll be anti- social.
Yeah, just keep going first, keep going around.  Get the feel of it, feel the clutch, when you put it in a little?
If you'll just maybe ease it into second.
Yeah, a little bit.  Listen, this is important.  When you feel it start to give, put the clutch in.
Check your mail tomorrow.  I sent you a letter, a letter.
I've never sent a letter like that, you know?  I mean, I felt like I wanted to tell you something, but I didn't put it in the letter, and I didn't say it, but I want to say it now, I'm not sure if I should say it, you know, 'cause people always say it and don't mean it, but I think that I mean it, so, um, I just wanted to tell you...
I was just going to tell you that I love you.  I said it.
What?  This is a good level, isn't it?
I think that we should spend some time apart.
Well, I need to study, and...
Yeah.
We'll see.
Did you tell anybody?
What is that?  What are you doing with your hands?  Talk to me, you're talking like that girl Sheila.
What do you want?
Hurt me again?  Not a chance, don't worry about it.
Man, all you gotta do is find a girl who looks just like her, nail her, and then dump her man, get her off your mind.
Hey man, I was in love once.  I got hurt really bad.  I never wanna go through that again.
No my brother, you have to go buy your own.
PAIN!
Hello.  Heard about that graduation present.  Really quite a car. Look, I know you're busy, you don't' have to retain me, but you can trust me.  I'll tell you a couple of things about myself, I'm nineteen, been overseas for a couple of semesters, but now I'm back.  I'm an athlete, so I rarely drink.  Kickboxing.  You heard of kickboxing, sport of the future?  Don 'The Dragon' Wilson, Lenny [?] merciless, one of the champions of the sport?  I can see by your face, no.  My point is, you can relax because your daughter will be safe with me for the next seven to eight hours.
How ya doing?  Is she around?
That's one of the things I wanted to talk to you about sir.
She can't still be angry at this, it's gotta get better.
Joe.  Joe.  She's written sixty-five songs.  They're all about you.  They're all about pain.
Lloyd.  Lloyd Dobler, I've got you.
Mike Cameron, how you doing?
Mike Cameron.  This is one fresh jam, huh?
Yeah, hey, oh god.  Listen, I wanted to... I don't know you very well, you know, but I wanted to ask you, how did you get Diane Court to go out with you?
This is great, this gives me hope.  Thanks.
It's gotta stay purple.  All night.  Hey Lloyd, how ya doin'?
Oh, I was just going to...
We're full on bonded.
Later for you, Luke.
He's essential.  Without him, everything comes to a grinding halt.  If that happens -
What's your name?
The gentleman thinks a mistake's been made.
What -
Your friend Amon Goeth has been arrested.
It's bad business.
That you know the meaning of the word gratitude.  That it's not some vague thing with you like with some guys.
Do you have any idea what's involved? The paperwork alone?  Forget you got to build it all, getting the fucking permits, that's enough to drive you crazy.  Then the engineers show up.  They stand around and they argue about drainage - I'm telling you, you'll want to shoot somebody, I've been through it, I know.
You held back Stern.  You held back the one man most important to my business.
I tried to call you, I'm running a little late, this is taking longer than I thought.  Have a drink.
What are you, Moses?  What is this? Where's the money in this?  What's the scam?
If you admit to making three, then it's four, actually.  But how?
Yeah, all right, don't tell me, I'll go along with it, it's just irritating to me I can't figure it out.
I want to thank you, sir, for giving me the opportunity to work.
I work hard for you.  I'll continue to work hard for you.
You have any idea what a shirt like this costs?
The place produces nothing.  I shouldn't say that - nothing it produces reaches the Army.  That's not all right.
Jews, yeah.  Investors.
This, I don't know, maybe you can trade it for something.
You think I don't know what you're doing? You're so quiet all the time?  I know.
I'll admit it's a weakness.  I don't think he enjoys it.  All right, he does enjoy it, so what? What do you expect me to do about it?
I'll talk to him.
We need to talk.
Well, that's to be expected.  They have to understand.  These are start-up problems. This isn't pots and pans, this is a precise business.  I'll write them a letter.
If I'd made more money ...I threw away so much money, you have no idea. If I'd just ...
A one-armed machinist, Oskar?
What's he done that's so bad - take money? That's a crime?  Come on, what are we here for, to fight a war?  We're here to make money, all of us.
We know that, son.
How's the name search going?
Have you checked the...
Outside.
Don't do that. Hang up...call...
...campus security...send someone...check out...place...
Yes.
We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight.
What if I said goodbye?
Why do you always answer a question with a question?
Hello? Ted?
You know the story, Gale. Man falsely accused, sent to prison, proved innocent, released back into the real world and never trusted again. Want the exclusive?
No, Gale, I don't have any rights. You made sure of that.
Hi, Gale, any leads?
But you’ll never get away with it.
I think he's doing Dolly.
Where have you been'? You missed my shining moment. I won the macaroni sundae binge.
About what?
Two.
Where's Sid?
He seemed harmless.
Of course not. Who wants to? What’s the point if we don’t get caught? Where’s the glamour in that?
A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it.
I never meant to imply...
Yeah?
If you were truly a copycat, wouldn't you want to emulate everything about the killer that you could?
Maybe not. But think about the sex. As frustrated as I am...
The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
Dewey?
Three hundred people watched? Nobody did anything?
Oh my God. How could it happen?
Look, Sid, why don't you take off? Disappear for a few days. I'll come with you.
Dewey, I'm completely equipped with mace, alarm whistle, keyring, knife, a degree in defensive combat...
It's good to see you involved.
Sid, I'll come with you.
What?
I don’t know.
What about rehearsal?
No, girletta, I don't leave your side.
We're missing the Sig Ep party.
I'm the only one who can cut him down.
The young girl runs by a window. She looks in. A GHOST MASKED KILLER stares back. The Figure CRASHES through the window attacking her. She fights him off, getting away, running...
I've been waiting for you, baby.
I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
Perfect. I'll be outta Micro-bio and we can grab a bite.
..this week's TKE kegger...
Do you want to die?
Take it off.
Thanks for the movie, Randy.
I think Jeff Bridges is getting tired.
There's always someone out there stalking actors. Look at that woman from the Commish.
I did. Hon, although I got a total of six minutes screen time, they're the best six minutes of the movie.
I think you got the wrong number, buddy.
Really? You're such a talented actor.
It's CICI! Cici's the name of the character she plays in the movie!
Where are you?
I know every face in here, respect for the unknown actor I suppose, myself included. If you're looking for Maureen Prescott --
What are these movies? 'Amazombies', 'Space Psychos' 'Creatures from theSan Andreas Fault'?
That's Sidney Prescott's mother.
Please, call me Gale.
OK, look.  We all know that this has something to do with 'Stab 3'.  What we do not know is why the killer keeps leaving articles about Maureen Prescott.
Hmm.
Nice to finally meet you, Sidney.
Sidney, do you have any idea how he could've gotten your number?
Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?!
You mean OUR past as in Me and Sid. This has nothing to do with you Gale.
Why would the police come to you?
Off the record.
The boys said no.  She wouldn't give her name. A month later, the station gets broken into, the file room ransacked.
I've got my suspicions but still, nothing  you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person.
Paternity test results. Christ Dewey, you're never going to believe who Milton's kid is.
Good morning Gale. Pleasure to be here.
AND I DIE NAKED?!  UGH! This is complete bullshit. Who wrote this piece of crap?
Who's phone?
God damn it you two! Run! Hurry! He's dead!
Oh, Come on!  You have made millions off the story of her murder.  You're obsessed with HER and you're obsessed with her DAUGHTER!
Well then, I guess I'll be leaving then.
Answer the question. You knew Sidney's mom?
I don't think so!  Just what happened to Maureen when she was in Hollywood?
Oh my God! Sidney, you ran fast or what?  Hey.
What'd he say?
Roman Bridger, director. And brother.  She slammed the door in my face, Sid. Said I was Rina's child and Rina was dead. And it struck me, what a good idea! So I watched her, made a little home movie, a little family film. Seems Maureen, mom, really got around. I mean, Cotton Weary was one thing, everybody knew about that, but Billy's father, that was the key! Your boyfriend didn't like seeing his daddy in my movies. Didn't like it at all. And once I supplied the motive, all the kid needed was a few pointers. Have a partner to sell out in case you get caught, find someone to frame, it was like her was making a movie.
Listen, I have no time for this. I've heard this shit before! So lets get on with it!
It's Sarah.
Would you give that script a rest? It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you.
Don't do it!  If you do one thing to attract attention, one thing, I'll kill them both. Now, do you have somewhere we can be alone?
You're dead!
Alright I'm here, now show your  face so we can finish this.
Uh-huh I'm sure. I've killed someone! OH MY GOD I'VE ACTUALLY KILLED SOMEONE!
Ready?
That's it, Billy. I can't take any more. I'm feeling woozy.
I thought she was dead.
What are you doing here?
And I was home, bored, watching television, THE EXORCIST was on and it got me thinking of you.
I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.
I'm so sorry... please understand.
No...
Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.
Your parents split up. It's not the same thing. Your mom left town, she's not in a coffin somewhere.
I think in some weird analytical, psychological bullshit way I'm scared I'm gonna turn out just like her, you know? Like the bad seed or something...
But this is life. This isn't a movie.
When you're arrested -- you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call?
Uh-huh.
It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE!
Yes.
Who are you trying to reach?
What number are you trying to reach?
Hello.
I don't think so.
What did you say?
That's not what you said.
Yes?
My boyfriend will be here any second and he'll be pissed when I tell him...
So you better leave.
How do you know his name?
Don't do this. I can't...
I don't know...
Michael... Michael Myers.
Afraid not.
I just turned 25. I was 24 for a whole year.
People treat me like the Antichrist of television journalism.
You gonna be able to come down to the station and talk to us a bit?
Have they found my father?
She's tough.
That ghost mask is sold at both Kroger's and WalMart. Neither of which keep purchase records.
Casey? Where are you honey? Call the police, goddamnit.
Off the record. No cameras.
He was convicted in a court of law. Your testimony put him away. It doesn't matter what I think.
Not one word. He admits to having sex with your mother but that's all.
She was never attacked. I think she made it all up.
The question is not who am I. The question is where am I?
So where are you?
Hello?
Looks like you fingered the wrong guy... again.
Are you okay?
I heard screaming.
...so call if you need me.
That was an ice pick -- not exactly the same.
Why would he want to kill his own girlfriend?
She's saving herself for you.
I thought everything was checked out.
What's Leatherface doing here?
His movie nut mind has snapped, Sid. He's gone psycho.
Come on, Sid. Give me the gun.
And to celebrate this impromptu fall break, I propose we have a party. Tonight, my house.
If Tatum sees you -- she'll draw blood.
Do you believe this shit?
Oh God! You don't know? Casey Becker and Steve Forrest were killed last night.
Not anymore. Her parents found her hanging from a tree. Her insides on the outside.
Fucking clueless -- they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors...
Thanks, Tatum.
Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis.
Take a message.
I didn't say that, Sid. But you know there were rumors. Your dad was always out of town on business. Maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman.
You can't prove a rumor. That's why it's a rumor.
If I was wrong Cotton, then he's still out there.
Hey, Sid. Just think if they make a movie about you. Who's gonna play you?
Billy's right. Whenever he touches me, I just can't relax.
What do you think about when you're having sex?
Hunt? Why would they ask if you like to hunt?
Because there's no way a girl could have killed them.
I thought you dumped her for me.
That's mature.
He cuts off the skin if his fingertips. That's why we can't find a single usable print in the apartment.  He's been doing it for quite a while.  Keeps cutting before the papillary line can grow back.
"Dear Detectives, Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light." It's the murderer's way of announcing himself.
Have you heard?
Well, there he sits.  It's not supposed to make sense.
And... and... and he said... he asked me if I was married.  And, I could see he had a gun in his hand.
She was... she was on the bed.  She was just sitting on the bed.
Give me the gun.
We're not just going to pick up two more bodies, are we, Johnny?  That wouldn't be... shocking enough.  Wouldn't keep you on the front page of the newspapers.
What makes you so special that people should pay attention?
You wouldn't because you know there are consequences.  It's in those eyes of yours, though... nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work.  I won't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner.  I only took their sins to logical conclusions.
I wish I could have been a normal man like you.  I wish I could have a simple life.
I... I don't follow.
Not here.
There's a bucket here.
It's a bucket of vomit.
Anyway... I did my time on door-to-doors, and walking a beat.  I did all that shit for a long time.
He ate his fill, and was forced to continue eating... till his body rejected the food. the killer held a bucket under him, and then kept serving.  He took his time.  The coroner says this might have gone on for more than twelve hours.  The victim's throat was swollen from the effort, and there was probably a point where he passed out.  That's when killer kicked him in the stomach.  Popped him.
It's too soon for him.
I'd like you to meet Somerset.
Our guy got into office, probably before the building closed and security tightened up.  Gould must have been working late.
Seven Terraces of Purgation.
This is the one thing.
What if it's not that she's seen something?  What if she's supposed to see something, but she just hasn't been given a chance to see it yet?
There must be something.
What?
Just, honestly... have you ever seen anything like this... been involved in anything like this?
All we do is pick up the pieces.  We take all the evidence, and all the pictures and samples.  We write everything down and note what time things happened...
I'm, sorry, but even the most promising clues usually lead only to other clues. I've seen so many corpses rolled away... unrevenged.
You tell me.  I'm new in town.
How was it?
Listen to me.  He's all about playing games.
Victor's landlord says an envelope of cash was in the office mailbox each month.  He says, quote, "I never heard a single complaint from the tenant in apartment three-o-one, and nobody ever complained about him.  He's the best tenant I've ever had.
There must be something in this pile of garbage we can follow.  I mean, Christ... do we have to let this lunatic make all the moves.
Sooner or later his luck's goning to run out.
How much money do you have?
Yeah.  Some college student who's taking English 101 and just happens to be writing a paper on Twentieth Century Crime.
This is a waste of time.
The Marquis de Sade and Origins of Sadism.
Wait... just wait.
You know... there's not going to be a happy ending to this.  It's not possible anymore.
You think you're doing me a big favor by staying?
As soon as this is over, I'm gone.
Slut.
I need you to look at each one carefully... very carefully.  Look for anything that seems strange or out of place.  Anything at all.
I hear you and Mills were high school sweethearts.
I was close once.  It just didn't happen.
Perfect example.
I don't know why I asked you to come.
I've been going to some of the schools, looking for work, but the conditions here are... horrible.
Oh, Tracy... I have to tell you, I'm not the one to talk to about this.
How's California?
It was Ethan found you squallin' in a sage clump after your folks was massacred...
Lucy's going on seventeen now...
It's all right, ma...I been watchin'... Only I wish...
Let's get along...
As to that, I don't know, Charlie... We hadn't got around to talkin' marriage...
It's all right...Charlie, let's move outside.
Another one, eh?
Now son, it's a bitter thing to say, but there's more than your sister at stake here.
You help me find her, you got your rockin' chair...
That's what I said.
And maybe you lie...
What you goin' to do?
Say it. We're beat!
He's agreed to take you on and share the increase from my herd while I'm gone...I'll be pushin' on tomorrow...
Martin...I want you to know some- thin'...
Hey! What's the idea...?
<U>YOU</U> don't understand, ya chunkhead! <U>You</U> didn't buy any blanket! Ya bought <U>her</U>!
Says her name's Wild Goose Flying in the Night Sky...but she'll answer to Look since it pleases ya...
I think maybe we oughta...
Well, you're a widower now...
Suit yourself...While you're enjoyin' your little conversation, I'll be ridin' out with Senor Fernandez here... The Comanch' medicine country ain't far...there's one camp with a chief named Cicatriz.
You figger Scar means to kill us?
I saw it...And don't try to tell me it was Aunt Martha's or Lucy's...
Well, we only got the one lead -- Scar...And where we begin to look, I don't know...
The <U>late</U> Mister Futterman?
Don't go takin' that stuff...
Take it and welcome...but don't count on finding me here when you get back...I've been dallying around this god-forsaken wind-scour almost two long years waitin' for you...I ain't cut out to be an old maid!
It wasn't much of a letter...
I mean the armchair!
Maybe the antenna's broken.
Hey... the fuse.
Look at this!  We'll have to fix the whole wiring.  This stuff is dangerous as hell.
What are you doing?
I was so excited about meeting you. Again and again, I kept getting in the back of the line so I could be the last to talk to you.
Now, what did I do to deserve this?
Hey, you're still here.  I suppose you like it here with us.
Will you finally cut it out?  Just in case you haven't noticed, I am trying to write a book here.  And maybe - even with your birdbrains - you can figure it's a pretty tough job. So why can't you just leave me alone?
Oh, Ellen.  My sweet Ellen... Of course I knew.
How did you get me out of there?
I really hate to bother him, but...
Frank Kosinski.  Here's the address.  Go see him.  Ask him.
Twenty-three, to be exact.
Hey, my man!  How's the masterpiece coming along?
We have no Juliet!
There is no dog in the first scene, Will Kempe, thank you. How goes it Will?
The title?
Black Sue, Fat Phoebe, Rosaline, Burbage's seamstress; Aphrodite, who does it behind the Dog and
Interesting.
Will it restore my gift?
Gentlemen! Thank you! You are welcome.
What's the title?
by order of the Master of the Revels!
So what do we do?
How?
Is it going well?
Do you know it?
Will! Where is my play? Tell me you have it nearly done! Tell me you have it started.  You have begun?
Well, I am a dead man and buggered to boot. My theatre is close by the plague these twelve weeks, my company is playing the inn-yards of England, while Burbage and the Chamberlain's Men are invited to court and receive ten pounds to play your piece, written for my theatre, by my writer, at my risk when you were green and grateful -
My tailor. Wants to be an actor. I have a few debts here and there. Well, that seems to be everybody. Did you see a Romeo?
Juliet? You mean Ethel.
By God, I wish I knew.
Another little problem.
The show must … you know
Juliet does not come on for twenty pages. It will be all right.
What is the story?
Ethel.
His best friend is killed in a duel by Ethel's brother or something. His name is Mercutio.
Good luck with yours, Kit.
This is a different one.
"But new struck nine."
Not ready? Where is she?
Be good to her, my lord!
But Silvia I did not care for much. His fingers were red from fighting and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons. Stage love will never be true love while the law of the land has our heroines played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats! Oh, when can we see another?
Playhouses are not for well-born ladies.
He sees himself in me! Romeo Montague, a young man of Verona.
"I come, anon--But if thou meanest not well, I do beseech thee--"
"…Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?"
"The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars As daylight doth a lamp. Her eyes in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night. See how she leans her cheek upon her hand. O that I were a glove upon that hand, That I might touch that cheek.
I would not for the world!
As any mule in Christendom. But if you are the man to rider her, their are rubies in the saddlebag.
What does Burbage care of that? He is readying the Curtain for Kit Marlowe.
Who are you, master?
You cannot! Not for the Queen herself!
Then I will go with you.
You lie in your meadow as you lied in my bed.
Will you read it for me?
"…thou need'st not to be gone."
But fearful of her virtue, she comes to him dressed as a boy
My lady Viola.
Your father should keep you better informed. He has bought me for you. He returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from Saturday.  You are allowed to show your pleasure.
How your mind hops about! Your father was a shopkeeper, your children will bear arms, and I will recover my fortune. That is the only matter under discussion today. You will like Virginia.
Why, yes! My fortune lies in my plantations. The tobacco weed. I need four thousand pounds to fit out a ship and put my investments to work--I fancy tobacco has a future. We will not stay there long, three or four years . . .
I mean…Your Majesty, they do not, they have not, but I believe there is one who can
You look sad, my lady! Let me take you riding.
I understand of course. It is to be expected.
Take off your hat.
Where did you learn how to do that?
Yes, sir.
She sings too?
Squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for personal domination.
I don't want to devalue your victory, but I just want you to know: I wasn't trying to win.
I'm only asking what you think.
I saw my grandmother, of course, but I don't suppose that counts. I mean, she was alive at the time.
You think so?
When are you going to let the police know?
So who's going to do it?
Listen, it's important. We need to talk about what we're going to do --
After you drink to love and happiness forever.
Good luck. I love that guy, but why does he have to follow us around?
Yeah, but you were good, you were really good. Fucking bin-bag', I liked that. You were good. You explored your maleness to the full there.
How much?
What's all this for, more security?
What? Yes, that's fine.
No, I'm sure, that'll be enough.
It wasn't deep enough. I told you it wasn't deep enough, but you wouldn't listen.
Of course you don't know anything about it. If you knew anything about it, I wouldn't have to send you over there to cover it.
Is this being recorded?
No. Why should it?
I don't know them.
Parked outside?
That's it, then.
Well, Cameron, are you comfortable?
When you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare hands, do you then summon hellfire?
No. Be someone else like him. One is enough. And what happened to that girl, that friend of yours, the one that came round. I liked her. I really felt we had something. She could have moved in. We had chemistry.
So we'll meet him, then?
I'm not usually drunk.
-- which is --
David hasn't seen him either.
He's got a car?
Now?
I wonder how he did it?
Unfeasible.
I don't want to. It's different.
Love and happiness for ever.
David, I promise we will. Keep him happy.
I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.
We have to talk.
Exactly. Now I've been thinking --
Now you thought of that, not me.
And if it sounds like I'm being killed, you'll phone the police, you'll tell them everything?
What?
You mustn't take it so badly.
Interesting.
So, uh...
It's OK. There's no problem.
No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up.
Yes.
Look, it's a fairly straightforward question. You're either divorced or you're not.
Just get on with it, Alex.
Two hundred.
Expecting anyone?
Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to?
Eh, I don't know.
Accounting, David, chartered accounting --
But they sneer, don't they?
Oh, it's unfashionable, I know, but, yes, we're methodical, yes, we're dilligent, yes, we're serious, and where's the crime in that, and why not shout it from the rooftops, yes, maybe sometimes we are a little bit boring, but by God, we get the job done.
What guy?
Oh, him. Well, he died.
What's it about?
Do you think you could answer that?
For what?
You can tell by the intonation.
Your watch.
You're in a good mood today, George.
That's George.
-- is that right?
What're you looking for?
Thanks a lot.
I don't know.
I'll be back in a while.
-- to be put in that kind of position...
What're you doing later?
What about?
I know.
Well, is she your girlfriend?
No. You know too many sick ladies.
Don't worry, honey, I'll protect you.
You here to see my mother?
She's out, but you're supposed to wait.
You're my mother's hairdresser?
Chopped liver?
See if you've been making it with my mother.
Nothing, I guess... have you ever made it with a guy?
No shit.
That you're just like your mother.
You are.
I am not!
Oh yes. Mrs. Shumann called about you.
I went to school with her husband.
So you want to go in business for yourself?
What sort of references do you have?
George!
Jesus...
-- Listen, I'm supposed to take Jill to El Cholo tonight. She's really going to be pissed if I don't.
-- Well no. It never came up.
Where do you want to do this?
You don't seem very sure.
Okay... but I want you to know one thing.  I've got to look great tonight, I mean I have to look great, okay?
Why not?
George... how about Felicia?
Can I count on that? I just want to see Lester with me and that cunt in the same room tonight.
George...
-- Just get me out of here, baby. I can't stand it. It's killing me.
That sounds like me.
He still having parties?
-- where'd you go?
-- ass and legs --
Why?
It's not okay, I mean we've got to talk now. Where are you going?
-- It's Malone's.
I've got to... I've got to tell him where I am.
I'm busy, man.
-- You takin' a lot of shit lately, George.
-- took a bus.
Hi, George.
Call me!
They're dumb, somebody... I don't know...
Now, George --
I'm gonna open the shop, baby, I'm gonna open the shop. I'm getting it together.
You're great.
Will we live together?
Maybe you don't even like children.
George?
Yeah, baby...
Yeah.
George.
I know but this is important. I have to make a decision.
What do you want?
When is that?
What?
I've been trying to reach you all afternoon. You weren't in the shop. What is this thing tonight?
What does he direct besides traffic?
I've got to get her out of here.
I don't want to fight, George.
How?
... well I'm glad you told me.
I wish you'd go now.
You need a cut.
Well, George, I invest for a lot of people. I make a lot of money for them. More than they could do for themselves.
But personal services are not the kind of thing I usually get into.
No, they're a pain in the ass, there's no way of keeping track of anything. It's a cash business and you've got to watch your operators or they'll steal you blind, am I right or am I right?
Tonight?
You look like you've had quite a work-out.
Well -- I could try. Do you wash your hair every day?
All night.
I wanna hear about it.
Was it me, did you have something against me?
Do you think Lorna hates her? I don't think she hates her. I mean she may resent her a little...
Oh, by the way, I think you oughta know -- Lorna thinks she's got the clap.

Well maybe I can get you something.
Oh, hi, I mean hello, we've met.
I go to the blue'n gold barber shop in Westwood. The guy in the third chair's dynamite... nobody much.
Maybe he ought to go to beauty school. Anyway, see you tonight, doll, okay?
George, glad you could make it, son. Hi, doll.
Does she know about us?
Well, he is.
I spent three years with him. I just couldn't take it not knowing who was gonna pay the rent... his unemployment or mine. George was adorable but it drove me crackers. Now at least I'm comfortable. Lester does what he says he'll do. Maybe you're happy living like a gypsy. Are you?
Face it, you can go around with cute guys and get hung up on their sexy bodies and things like that but sooner or later you've got to find somebody. Face it, time isn't on your side.
Jill, you're a real sweetie pie. You really are.  You're sure you don't mind?
It must be something.
Five times a day?
Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?
He does?
-- See, I just know that if I go to Egypt, well, things happen, I just don't know what'll happen to us, he just never seems to think ahead, does he?
Go ahead, Jill, you can say it.
Well he's not exactly a friend.
Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend.
I'm terribly sorry.
George? Was he alone?
Now I didn't mean that, you rat.
What did you say your name was, sweetheart?
-- yes, Jill.
Do you have children?
Yes?
You wouldn't ever hurt Mummy and me, would you?
Are you sure?
Do you like ice cream, Doc?
Yes.
I don't know.
Room 237?
We're just going to go into one of the other rooms for a few minutes and talk - then I'll come back and check on you, okay?
Give me your hand.  Oh, isn't it beautiful.
I didn't think it was going to be this big, did you?
Mom?
Red Rum.
Red Rum.
Mommy...
Mommy!
Now Danny, when you were brushing your teeth, do you remember if you smelled anything funny, or saw any bright flashing lights, or anything at all strange?
No.
To my stomach.
Now I'm going to ask you to do me a favor, and stay quietly in bed for the rest of the day.  Okay?
Please...
Mrs. Torrance, I don't think you have anything to worry about.  I'm quite sure there is nothing physically wrong with Danny.
Have you been in Boulder long, Mrs. Torrance?
Oh I wouldn't think of it.
haven't I seen you somewhere before?
No.
No need to rub it in, Mr. Grady. I'll deal with that situation as soon as I get out of here.
I fear that you will have to deal with this matter in the harshest possible way, Mr. Torrance.  I fear that is the only thing to do.
Dick, if you're ready to do it now, I think it would be a good idea if you could show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen, while I continue on with Jack.
I did?
I'm a writer um... Teaching has been more or less a way of making ends meet.
Eleven thirty - Jesus!
and it will then take me time to get back to where I was, understand?
or whether you don't hear me typing, whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here, when I am in here that means that I am working - that means don't come in.  Now do you think you can handle that?
You went into the room Danny said - to 237?
He's still asleep.
Shovellings out driveways, work in a car wash - any of that appeal to you?
Well I... I think maybe he should be taken to a doctor.
As soon as possible.
Stay away from me,
Stay away from me!
Stop it!
Stay away from me.
Wendy...
Give me the bat.
Have any trouble finding us?
JAck, just make yourself at home. Would you like some coffee?
...the winters can be fantastically cruel, and the basic idea is to...to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur.  And this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can't get a foothold.
can of itself be a problem.
The moon's not down yet...
You always take his side because he's a cripple! Well, it's not my fault that he's a cripple!
I don't want your money. You're a booger.
Mom was really mad at him this time, wasn't she?
Not bad, huh? My Uncle Al took off the regular muffler and put on a Cherry Bomb.
Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime this summer and we'd soup up the engine... but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother.
Well, it's probably nothing. I'm just spooked since... you know.
There's a saying- so-and-so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. You ever hear that one?
Your mom's not around, is she?
You gave me a heart attack, Marty. I'm dying. I hope you're happy, because you are looking at a dying man.
It goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys' Choir.
What is it?
Was it a prescription?
I want you to turn this into a silver bullet.
I saw what I saw.
No one knows how cancer begins, either- or exactly what it is- but people still believe in it.
I haven't enjoyed Mass this much in years.  What a marvelous program. Innovative.  Inspiring.  You are to be commended.
I must tell the Cardinal.  I.11 send him a personal letter, describing your efforts, your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive.
Yeah.  We all got caught.  Shoplifting. Cuttin' school.  Cuttin' up some bitch with a blade.  So we gotta come here.  So we'll be good, in the future.  So we'll learn valuable lessons.  And I learned mine.  I will be incredibly good, I will never rip out nobody's nose-ring by accident ever again.  Can I go now?
How come?  Sister?
What?
I want us to be together.  Like people. Honest, decent people.  In the eyes of God.  Babe, today... I went to confession.
What? 
You bastard!
What, Vincent?  This is me, doll.  I know you.  What did you think you were doing?  Running to the cops.  Hiding out. No, no.  You're sorry now, aren't you?
This prom is a real drag.
Oh my! 
Isn't it lovely?  Now I'll demonstrate, and then you can hop right in.  You just draw your beater in, keep it pressed against the pick, and open the shed.  Then pass your shuttle, beat, and open the next shed.  Shuttle. beat, beat, shuttle, beat, shed.  Keep tension on the warp.  Is that clear?
Two days.  An hour or so.
What is it, Mary?
Jackpot!  Two buckets
Which convent?  It was, um, the Little Sisters... of the Moonlight.  In Vegas. Everybody used to come to Mass.  Frank. Dean.  Sammy.  Right at ringside.
What?
Bobs
Mary Clarence!
What was all that?  Who was that man? Why would he shoot at us?
What?
But what do they want?  Where are we going?
A convent?  They put me in a convent? What's the problem?  Wasn't there any more room in Hell?
Sit down.
It has come to pass.
Excused.  Open the cabinet to your left. You will find appropriate attire.
No!  No!  I can't do this!
But look at rites  Look at this!  I'm a nun!  I'm invisible!  I'm a penguin!
And the vow of chastity.
Sisters, for the rest of the day we shall declare a Vow of Silence.
This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence.
Oh, I don't know... Satan?
Sometimes it's not enough!
Really catching on.
So... hi there.
Clearly, you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself.
Mary Clarence, perhaps you are correct.
Exactly.  People like going to theaters and casinos.  But they think church is for Grandma -- we could change that. Pack the joint.
Please let me try.  I'm begging you.
A vote?
You sent for me?
You and I know that life is not so simple.  There will be disappointments. Rude shocks.  And you will have vanished. How... fortunate.
Then I guess you're stuck.  Life sentence.  No parole.
Okay, here's what I want.  I know about this stuff.  A five-star hotel.  With room service.
But I'm going insane!  All these people do is pray and work, work and pray!  I don't get it -- when's the weekend? They have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call food!  Gruel -- it's like Alpo for nuns! I sleep in a cell, on a board, and I pray five times a days  Do you know what I pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea? Check your crotch, Eddie --anything fall off yet?  Get me outta her!
Like what?
Eddie!  You scared the hell out of me!
It wasn't my fault!  They just showed up.  It's helping the convent.
I know that.  This isn't about me.  It's about the choir.  You should hear them. They're good.  Really good.  And I taught them.
I can't go with you.
Eddie -- I've got to go back.  They won't sing without me.  I'm deserting them.
People throw stones.  They call me names.  I mean, really.
But you didn't tell me!
And if she runs?
He's so damn cocky.  This is different.
Right.
I'm telling you, she's not a nun!  Get her out of the nun outfit, and put her in some clothes.
She was real quiet and peaceful all the way back in the car.
A sweater.
Yes, Mary Patrick?
She told us about one.  The Little Sisters of the Moonlight.  In Las Vegas.
We did it!  We actually sang a chord!
Mary Clarence, don't be silly.  You're an example to us all.  You've taught us so much.  We're singing for the Cardinals, and then -- who knows?  Maybe the choir can travel -- to schools, and nursing homes.
Mary Clarence!  Sister!
We can't sing without her!  What should we do?
You mean -- they kidnapped her?
Excuse me -- has anyone seen a nun?
Mary Clarence -- you're alive!
Reverend Mother?
But, Bishop, surely you realize -- this is a most dangerous neighborhood.
Soon, you gorgeous thing... tell me... how lonely?
She's a nun, Vince.
Where?
Excuse me, gentlemen, but... who has seen this Horseman?
What the hell are you doing?
They spend two days in chains.
No bleeding.
The wounds are the same.  Cauterized. No chopping or half-measures either. One stroke took the head.  Have you seen, doctor... ?  Even the spinal bone... sliced as smooth as butter.
It has been a terrible jolt to her nerves.
Stains of blood.
Damn... damn... damn...
Just so.  Granted.  And so you take your experimentations to Sleepy Hollow and catch the murderer who has tainted the place.  Bring him here to face our good justice. Will you do this for me?
Tell me something.  What becomes of Young Masbath?
The Widow Windsor.
We are farmers here, not lawyers or bankers, or even constables.  Every penny we earn comes from what we send down the Hudson.
What is it?
I hear nothing.
What does it mean... climb down to the Horseman's soulless place?
Intestate.  Your farm... all the farms... they belong to no one.
What was she doing?
There are no other doors.  This is as far as she could have gone.
What now?
How are you?
Did they tell?  It is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone.  According to the elders, an Indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken, and spells cast then still linger to this day.
He only appears to be inside the cage.  The point being...
Oh, you are hopeless.  May I keep it at least?
I have misjudged you I think.  I did not imagine you were so cruel.
Take a lesson from Young Masbath's desires, Ichabod Crane.  He follows with you to avenge his father's death. That I understand.  But, what do you want?
Lady Van Tassel... she is your stepmother, isn't she?  She bears so little resemblance.
Blood.
What are you doing?
The church.
What was that?
You said yourself.  What mere man could have downed the Belltower?
Returning to the Western Woods?
It appears well.  It has already clotted.
Pardon.  You did not answer when I knocked.  Are we intruding?
Lay still, Ichabod.  Do not move.
He rides tonight.
She is guilty.
Yeah, they's good all right.
They give me fifty dollars when they turned me loose. I spent up some of it on ridin' the bus and eatin' french-fried potaters.
All right then. I'll see you bright and early. How you comin' along on that garden tiller?
Hit ain't got no gas in it.
How 'bout you, Jerry.
Well, I guess it's all good.
Yeah.
... on the third day I washed her. She wasn't very clean. I got all the right spots. She was the first one I ever kept for any length of time, you see I get bored easily, I have a short attention span. I can't say she enjoyed her stay, although the washcloth in her mouth held in place by good duct tape kept any complaints to a minimum. I don't really like people who talk a lot. I like to do the talking. I guess that's why I'm so fond of you. You're so easygoing, although I do sense a little tension in you sometimes. By the way, how was it out there? Did you have any fun? Make any new acquaintances? Tell me what it was like.
I bet you did. I was never bent that way. I'm bent the other way. So, you liked it out there in the world.
Hey Freddy, what's goin' on boy. I seen your pitcher in the paper for catchin' that big-ass bass.
He'll be here in a little while, he's takin' me to get an ice cream.
Okay ladies and gentlemen  or both. It's come to the time in our show when we like to introduce the band. Over here on lead guitar Mr. Randy Horsefeathers. Come on hit a hot lick, Randy.  Well, come on, y'all are supposed to clap now. Come on! 
You're not stayin' here tonight. Go get sober before you come back. I'm tired of my child seein' this. Now you get yourself straight or I'll lock your ass out of my life for good.
Leave.
Leave.
Well, that's good. It's about time to eat and you know what I'm cravin'? Some of that take out chicken. Why don't you run get some of it, honey, for lunch?
All right, y'all gonna go with me?
I ain't sure.
Stop it, Doyle! Don't talk about daddy, you hear me!
Sure, I guess.
I heard you was more than friends. I heard Dick Rivers caught y'all all bowed up and goin' at it in the same room with poor, little, old Mizz Ogletree and her dead as a doornail layed out on a gurney.
I'd better go on home now, it's late. I have to work tomorrow.
I bet you like sittin' between two men in a dual wheel truck don't you?
We don't have a goddamn band! Y'all just shut the fuck up! We don't need no practicin' or managers cause we ain't no fuckin' band! Morris ain't no genius and the rest of you are just losers. Am I the only one sane human bein' around here? Just get the hell out of my house and don't come back!
What's in your bag?
You believe in the Bible?
Where's ever'body else? You seen 'em?  I thought I told you to get the hell moved out of here anyway.
Hey Frank. You shouldn't be coming over here. My parents really don't want you to.
He's gonna be around a lot and I hope you are too, so...
Are you well?
Hey there. I thought I heard somebody on the porch. Wasn't your name Karl?
I've had a lot of bad thoughts since my daddy died. Sometimes I wish I was still real little and he was still here. My mama's real good, but I wish I had both of 'em.  When we went to Memphis one time in the car, it was rainin' so hard we couldn't see the road. But I wadn't scared because I thought as long as daddy was drivin' nothin' could happen to us. I feel that way about mama now.  Mama has a boyfriend now. His name is Doyle Hargraves. He works construction so he makes a pretty good livin'. He still don't help mama out with any money though. He ain't no good. He's mean to her. He don't like me at all. Mama says it's because he's jealous I belong to my daddy instead of him. He stays with us all night sometimes, but he's got his own house. Somebody told me it's so he can still have other girlfriends. I like it on the nights when he ain't at our house. I'm not so nervous then.
It ain't the truth. He shot hisself with a shotgun on purpose.
Were they bad people?
Well, I hate him.
Will you stay here with us for a long time?
I like the way you talk.
I'm gettin' tired of readin' for a while.
I usually get run off by her mama or daddy if they're home. Reckon why they don't like me?
Oh, jackin' off?
So it died when it come out?
She said she'd see me later. That's kinda good, right?
What you readin'?
I'll play ball with ye. I reckon if neither one of us is no count it won't make no difference.
Just diggin'.  I ain't ever gonna be happy now. Not with that son of a bitch movin' in for good. I wish me and you and Mama could just run away. But she said he would find us wherever we went. He's crazy. Sometimes I think it would of been better if I wadn't ever born.
Karl, I ain't tryin' to say nothin' bad about you, but why don't you stop Doyle when he gets that away? You're older than him. You're strong, too. My daddy wouldn't let him do that to me and Mama.
Ever'thing's okay, boy. I kindly want to put my arm around ye for a minute and then I'm gonna go on and leave here.
How come Karl won't eat here with us?
Karl, now listen, there's gonna be a party tonight here at the house. Doyle's invited his music-playin' buddies over to make a bunch of racket out on the patio.
He's no more an Indian than I am though. Anyhow, Doyle's gonna try and tease you and be mean to you to show off to his friends. Just like he does to Frank and me sometimes. You just ignore it. Or stay out here away from 'em if he'll let you. He's an okay guy till he gets drunk but tonight he'll get drunk. I guarantee it.
We don't need to think bad thoughts, do we Mama?
What are you doin' up again, Frank? You need to get a little sleep.
Yeah, he has to go to work in a little while. I do too.
I guess. He went to the garage. Poor thing, he's probably never seen such a crazy mess. He probably wants to go back and live in Mr. Cox's shop.
I know he does.
These is the worst shoes I own for walkin'. How far did you want to go?
A blister shore can hurt.
Well, you have to learn. It'll take some time. Don't you know anybody down there to help you out?
I know, I've seen it myself. Would you give that a try?
Karl, you up?
Didn't you go to sleep at all, Karl? You been sittin' there like that all night?
Do you reckon you can make me some biscuits?
Just whenever you take a notion to. I don't aim to put you out.
I wouldn't mind a havin' supper.
It's been here seventeen years. Did you live here before or something?
Karl, what are you doing here? Come in.
I don't know why you're so weirded out, this is not San Quentin, it's just a nuthouse. Most of these people don't even know where they are, they're not gonna hurt you.
Let's just go, Marsha.
My name's Jerry Woolridge.
I don't know what to tell you. I'm sorry. I made myself pretty clear I thought. He probably got busy and wasn't thinking. I know how that is. I used to teach shop and eighth grade science.
His mother told him that he was their punishment. Hers and his father's; from God, for having sex--
Yes.
And what are you, his chaperone?
Will that be cash or charge?
So your mother grew up in Shanghai?
And the bookstore? Have you been working there long?
Wow. You don't fool around, do you?
What happened?
What about for you?
Do me a favor, will you?
Seven eighty-five out of twenty.  Take care of yourself now, and don't do anything I wouldn't do.
It's yours?
So you're not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter.
Yeah. There she is. She's in quite a few from that year. She must have been on her way to work.
Hey, man, good to see you.
So, what brings you to a dive like this?
I'm thinking about the kid. I'm sure he'd do a good job for you.
Don't be an ass, Auggie. He's trying to make it up to you, can't you see that?
It could have been worse. If the cops hadn't come, I might not be standing here now.
No. The ... uh ... the Bobbsey Twins lit out when they heard the sirens. But at least they stopped playing that marimba duet on my skull.  Assaultus interruptus.
So what did he say when he called?
It's not a long drive. An hour, an hour and a half. We'll be back in time for dinner.
I'm all ears.
Christ, Ruby, it's been so long. I figured you were dead.
Talk away, lady of my dreams. I'm all ears.
I know what it means. That still don't make it a good name.
A couple of moments, I'll grant you that. A second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity.
That I wasn't bullshitting you, sweetheart. At least you'll know I've been telling the truth.
She looks just like you.
Jesus Christ. This is all I need.
So you're just going to give up and go home?
Fuck this angel shit. Just take the dough, Ruby. But no bawling, okay? I can't stand people who blubber.
Yeah, I know. To that girl who moved to Pittsburgh.
Lovely.
To look at the dirty magazines. I can see all the naked women I want, and it doesn't cost me a cent.
Come on, come on, you yellow belly. The whole thing. First name and last name.
Seventy-eight dollars. The girl who rolled these was probably wearing panties.
Forty-four. They're on special this week from the Canary Islands. A real bargain.
What do you mean, how'd I get in? I pushed the door and walked in. What do you think?
I'm looking for my nephew,  Thomas.
Rashid? Rashid! Is that what he told you his name was?
His parents? Is that what he told you? His parents?
Why don't you pick some other spot? It gives a man the creeps to be stared at all morning.
Let me give you some useful information, son. There's two dollars and fifty-seven cents in that cash register over there  and considering all the time you've put in casing the joint so far, you won't make but about fifty cents an hour for all your pains. However you slice it, that's a losing proposition.
Benefits?
And have you mended them?
Be nice, sweetie. We're just here to help you.
You can do whatever you want with your own life. We're thinking of the baby, that's all. We want you to get yourself cleaned up for the baby. Before it's too late.
What are you talking about?
Sure. He's the guy who threw his cloak down over the puddle.
Hey, Jimmy. You got the time?
Watch out, man. You'll get yourself killed like that.
It's okay, mister. No big deal.
Mostly what.
Absolutely. The world is my oyster.  Whatever that means. 
Not a penny, not a stitch. I'm cool, man. 
That's because we don't belong anywhere. You don't fit into your world, and I don't fit into mine. We're the outcasts of the universe.
Thanks. 
Okay, just a little hint. I can't tell you the story, but I'll tell you what gave me the idea for it.
Uh, actually, I tend to shy away from that kind of thing.
His only copy.  I mean, if you think you're going to die, what's more important, a good book or a good smoke? And so he huffed and he puffed, and little by little he smoked his book.
I don't know.
Yeah, well, you have to be nuts to do what you did. If you want my opinion, you should give this money back to the Creeper. Just give it back and tell him you're sorry.
Cuban cigars. You mean he had some hanky-panky going with those guys?
Here's what you're going to do. You're going to open up your backpack, take out your bag of money, count out five thousand dollars, and hand it over to Auggie.
Hi, kid.
We came here to deliver some clean laundry.
Yeah, give him another one. And I'll take a cup of coffee while you're at it.
I'll take the iced coffee.  You only live once, right?
But you can't say with any certainty that the blood was his.
I don't know.
What do you mean by 'dirty looks'?
Now, Mister Gi...
Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog.
We discussed that.  And decided not to.
He's still got a good grip.  We need to dig more.
The best part was that there was a 'this'.  To debate the wrongness of.
I can just feel my spirits soar.
I couldn't say anything.  I just stood there, hating her.
I'm married, Ishmael.  It isn't right for us to be alone.  People will t...
I felt Milholland's report in my pocket.  And wondered why I wasn't telling her.  Telling someone. What I'd found.
And your evaluation of the defendant?  Could he kill a much larger man with a fishing gaff? So quickly, there would be no sign of struggle?
And you weren't there, when the coroner examined the wound.
Maybe it went.  Where Carl went. Over the side.
<u>Everything</u> had to happen <u>just</u> right.  For your little story to fly.  I mean, a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a <u>lot</u> of reasons.
Yes.  Initially.
They got transferred that day. Out to Cape Flattery.
You said three minutes.
He's looking down.  And he's not thinking 'bout the man you were yesterday.  He's proud of the man you are tonight.  That's what counts.
Coincidences happen.  You run a yellow light <u>just</u> as a car comes out of nowhere.  Split-second tragedy happens every day.  Or maybe...
Then where's the lantern?  And where's the knife?
What makes you think I play?
Bet there's a few things you could teach me.  Kendo, for one.
You want me to say that.
Is it possible his head struck the transom, or the stern gunnel, or the net roller, as you were bringing him in?
How <u>is</u> your mother-in-law?
That's <u>why</u> the autopsy report identifies <u>drowning</u> as the cause of death.
So your husband said he's think it over.  Encouraged Mr. Miyamoto to believe he might sell to h...
Carl ever say <u>he</u> got one?
Improved...how?
Which of you dolls is Daphne?
Pardon me, Mr. Bienstock - can I have my flask back?
Same faces - same instruments -  - and here's your Valentine's card.
What are you giving me with the rabbit?
But suppose he loses?
But suppose it doesn't?
Well, that solves one problem.  We don't have to worry about who to pay first.
But we'll freeze - it's below zero - we'll catch pneumonia.
Greased Lightning!  Why do I listen to you? I ought to have my head examined!
Right.  We have the same blood type...
No.  And he ain't been eating so good, either. He's got an empty stomach and it's gone to his head.
All the way to Urbana - for a one night stand?
I think they got me.
You don't see any blood?
How about that talent?  This is like falling into a tub of butter.
Not there - that's the emergency brake.
Look - no butter, no pastry, and no Sugar!
Steady, boy.  Just keep telling yourself you're a girl.
Good night, Daphne.
What happened?
What are you talking about?  Sugar and me, we're just like sisters.
What message?  What motorboat?
And where's he going to be?
Because we're pals - buddies - the two musketeers.
What happened?
Jerry, you'd better lie down. You're not doing well.
Like what are you going to do on your honeymoon?
Jerry, listen to me - there are laws - conventions - it's just not being done!
Hey - these are real diamonds.
It's just going to break his heart when he finds out I can't marry him.
What are you giving me with the omelette?
Sugar?
It's all fixed!  Osgood is meeting us on the pier -
I'm a girl, I'm a girl, I'm a girl -
I'm not that sick.
Look, Sugar, if you feel you're coming down with something, the best thing is a shot of whiskey.
Uh-uh.  Not yet.
Not you, Sugar.
What do you think you're doing?
I mean, your shoulders - and your arms -
Yeah - Josephine.
Josephine -
No, no, Sugar - wait.  I have a feeling she's going to show up any minute.
No!
What for?
We could dye our hair.
Hello, Mr. Morris? This is Poliakoff, in Chicago. Say, you wouldn't have a couple of girl musicians available? A sax player and a base?
It certainly is delightful to have some young blood around here.
Yes, indeed.  It's cost my family quite a bit of money.
Goodbye, Mr. Fielding.
About that roadhouse -
Oh, that's all taken care of.  I'm giving them shore leave.  We'll have a little cold pheasant - and champagne - and I checked with the Coast Guard - there'll be a full moon tonight - oh, and tell her I got a new batch of Rudy Vallee records -
Wait a minute.  Where do you think you're going?
Oh?
Good!  Then you won't be needing your car.
What are you - a couple of comedians? Get out of here!  Long distance?  Get me the William Morris Agency in New York.
The wrong shape?  You looking for hunchbacks or something?
No, we couldn't!
Tell what?
Yes.  I come from a very musical family. My mother is a piano teacher and my father was a conductor.
Rough?
You don't say?
Brains aren't everything.
About the future.  You know - like a husband?  That's why I'm glad we're going to Florida.
Okay, Sugar - all clear.  You better go back to bed.
What else?  And was I ever crazy about him. Two in the morning, he sent me down for knackwurst and potato salad - they were out of potato salad, so I brought coleslaw - so he threw it right in my face.
What makes you so sure?
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
You're not hurt, are you?
I'm not interested at all.
Well - a group of us are appearing at the hotel. Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.
So do I.  as a matter of fact, I spent three years at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.
- and always the same Four Hundred.
You're very kind.  I'll bet you're also very gentle - and helpless -
Maybe I'll tell you when I know you a little better.  What are you doing tonight?
Oh?
Would you mind moving along, please?
Well, I guess I'd better go -
The most wonderful thing happened -
Do you mind riding backwards? It may take a little longer -
Love it.  Which way?
Champagne?
You know, I've never been completely alone with a man before - in the middle of the night - in the middle of the ocean.
See?  Nothing.
Oh, it's not your fault.  It's just that every now and then Mother Nature throws somebody a dirty curve.  Something goes wrong inside.
Well, it was my freshman year at Princeton - there was this girl - her name was Nellie - her father was vice-president of Hupmobile - she wore glasses, too.  That summer we spent our vacation at the Grand Canyon - we were standing on the highest ledge, watching the sunset - suddenly we had an impulse to kiss - I took off my glasses - I took a step toward her - she took a step toward me -
My family did everything they could - hired the most beautiful French upstairs maids - got a special tutor to read me all the books that were banned in Boston - imported a whole troupe of Balinese dancers with bells on their ankles and those long fingernails - what a waste of money!
Don't talk like that.  I'm sure there must be some girl some place that could -
Anything this time?
You're not giving yourself a chance. Don't fight it.  Relax. 
I got a funny sensation in my toes - like somebody was barbecuing them over a slow flame.
They told me I was caputt - finished - washed up - and now you're making a chump out of all those experts.
Oh, no.  I'm off that stuff - for good.
Gee, I wish I'd been there.
Really?
Where to?  South America?  Oh. That is unexpected.
A merger?  How long will you be gone?
You're not?
Oh - that kind of a merger.  Is she young? Pretty?
Oh, of course.  I understand.  At least, I think I do.
You'll forget him, Sugar.
Sugar!  What do you think you're doing?
I don't believe I've seen you at any of our services before.
PLEASE!
Better bring the check now - in case the joint gets raided.
Quit kidding.  You did that vulcanizing job on Toothpick Charlie - and we know it.
Me and those two witnesses whom your lawyers have been looking for all over Chicago.
All right, Charlie - this the joint?
Too bad, Charlie.  You would have had three eights.  Goodbye, Charlie!
I should get going.
Hey.
Wow. You look beautiful.
Fred Astaire and what’s her face!
You know all that “if these walls could talk” stuff? Do you believe it? That a place has a memory?
You’d better get going. My parents will be ‘round to cart you off to the country.
Mom’s refining her strategy for DDay.
I blame Tony Pee-Pants!
There’s a reason I always tell that Tony Pee-Pants story, you know.
Just because some slag’s been paid for, doesn’t mean you’ve got to...you know.
I’ll just check into a hotel.
Remember when we went hiking in the lake district and Amy was wearing that little bikini thing.
Hey, man.
Why, Jeffrey. Hello.
Hey, Kat.
Hey, you!
So, tell me, how’s unmarried life?
Whoa, Jeffrey. Slow down. You and me, we’re the past. I’m not sure if you noticed, but I’m here with someone else.
That was a long time ago.
Is this supposed to be an apology?
Brilliant.
I’m sorry?
You think we look like we’re trying too hard.
Jeffrey knows love like he knows macramé.
What?
Would you grab my shampoo?
So...what was I...oh, yeah. Do you honestly think that I want to be single and miserable? That I want to be obsessed with some asshole who led me on for years then -- out of the blue -- shattered my heart.
Yes.
Are you sure?
Is this for last night?
There was something in your voice on the phone that day.
Yeah. You?
You let me make a fool of myself! You lied to me! I don’t know why that surprises me because lying is what you do. It’s your job. It’s who you are. How would you even know if something were real?
Yeah.
I’m worried. Amy’s not good at drinking. She gets sooo drunk sooo fast. Does free alcohol get you less drunk or more drunker?  Is it ‘drunker’ or ‘drunker-er’?
I thought you were living in San Francisco. Or was it Nepal?
I am now, sir.
What do you say to that?
Best thing about being a dad is when your kid starts kicking your ass--
I just wanta wash my hand. It's got blood where I hurt it.
It's a good thing your hand did not become infected -- how did you cut it like this?
That does it...
You got a pretty house, Miss Johnson!
Here it is, right here.
Here's one by a man that's very much alive.
What about Sounder?
... So me and Sounder, ran right by the men that was the prisoners, and crawled under the fence! That's when I cut my hand on the glass. It hurt like mad! But I kept runnin', and then I didn't feel no more hurtin' till I stopped runnin'!  Why was that, Miss Johnson?
Well, you shouldn't worry about him too much, David.
You know that the class is going to challenge your story, don't you, Clarence?
Clarence, would you tell us a story that was not true, after telling us it was?
Can you swim?
:...FINER SPIRITS BOON AND GUERDON FOR WHAT THEY LOSE ON EARTH BY BEING BLACK.
I see you found what you was lookin' for.
There ain't no possums in this woods tonight, Daddy.
If anybody's to blame, it's me -- I oughta nailed him when I took that shot.
Do you think he's dead, Daddy?
Why, Daddy; you won't be here?
And me too, son! You shore done got to be such a big little man!
You bet we is!
Goodnight, Daddy...
Mornin', son...
I'm real proud of how you helped your mama to keep this place goin', David Lee.
Wheeew! This is some hard work, but it beats goin' to jail.
You hurt, Daddy!?
Don't take my Daddy! Please don't take my Daddy!
What is it, David Lee?
So did I. I figured when the time got right, we could all take a day or two and walk up there, but it's not the kind of long trip for a child to take alone.
So when I left, she gave me these books.
What's wrong with him, David?
It's when the heat is so bad, dogs go crazy.
When you read it we'll talk about it...
Come, I'll take you home.
I guess so -- but I went home and did me some praying to the Lord. I said, Lord, I went into this white church down in Row and all I want you to tell me is how I ever got outta there in one piece.
Hi ya doin' there, Ike?
Don't take all day at that table, David Lee.
The boy done went into my walnuts! I skin my fingers to the bone to pick two pounds that's worth almost nothing at the commissary and he done took almost half of what I pick!
Good mornin', Nathan.
What did he want?
It's the rules and I gotta follow 'em. No visitin' 'cept holidays and Sunday -- and no womenfolk anytime.
Wait, you're supposed to tell me how to get Wendy to like me.
Oh but OF COURSE children are going to see it!!
OW!! That HURT GOD DAMMI-
Well, anyway... Today children, our friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all about the environment.
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!?!
What is this?
What?
No, I know. I'm just fucking STOKED I don't have to pay him!
But they fucking didn't do anything wrong!
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!
Bingo. Okay, here we go...  Want to help Terrance and Phillip? Meet us for a meeting at Gladdy's barn tomorrow night...
Your behind?
Cartman?!
CARTMAN!
Mph rmph rm!!
I don't have proofs of purchases from Snacky Smores, Kenny!
Mrphmmmph!!!
Goodnight, honey.
If you went down on a horse... You'd tell me, right?
So you see, the point and the theme of the film is kept intact. And of course, the MPAA didn't cut out any of the graphic violence. What did you think?
You bastards.
WE'RE going! WE started La Resistance to save Terrance and Phillip! We're going!
Yes I am!
Him? I don't know... He can be nice... sometimes.
Mph rmph rm rmph rmph rm!
No... The General is right.
Oh my God...
What's a butfor?
Now listen carefully. Stan and Kyle, you stand watch here and await my return. If any guards come by, make a sound like a dying giraffe.
Gwpaapa. Gwpaapa.
No! That's not Terrance or Phillip!
<b>Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for Knew it in a word Saw it in a glance The only thing I think I'd die for...</b>
Now remember, don't tell anybody we saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!
Oh my God! THEY killed Kenny!
How can they do this?
Dude, our moms arrested Terrance and Phillip!
This is sweet!!
It's only a matter of time before my mom has HIM burned too!
"Found Eight Million Pages With the Word Clitoris"!
Dude, do you know what you're doing?
Oh Lord, what have we done...?
We have to have air strikes on their military and entertainment centers.  It's the only way to ensure that their smut can't reach American soil!
SILENCE!  I AM SATAN!
How is the children's progress?
Well, Terrance I hope you learned something from this whole experience.
Oh, Phillip.  This cannot be good.
Phillip, this is worse than that trip to Quebec City when I fell asleep in that disco.
AGH!
You're quite a purveyor of filth, little boy!
Who's my cream puff?
You know I do.
That's because I wanted to fuck you, dumbass! Now hows aboot you get those pants down!
I TOLD you not to make that deal, Saddam!
No, Saddam. You made a deal. You can't just renege on a deal. That's lying.
Help you? You've destroyed my life and now you want me to help you?!  You're always making me feel like a piece of shit.
Now do what I say and keep your fucking mouth shut!
We saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!
Did you see that, Wendy?
Yeah!
Hi Wendy.
Wendy... How would you like to go get some ice cream?
Well I guess there's no time like the present.  I'll go run a check on that room, just to show we go that extra mile for our guests.
No, I just ran it!  Why are you running it again?
It's telling me fail mode confirmed.  Did you see this?
Yes I'm sure I hit the right commands.
You're certain of that?
You want to go back to shuttle work?
What, and leave you here all by your lonesome?
Much as I'd like to help you and our valued guests, I'm afraid I can't.
It's still not going to work! They'll detect you upon re-entry in an emergency vessel!
That was a joke Taylor, lighten up!  Why don't you just hold them up to the lens.  I'll write them down, and once I'm through verifying them, I'll get back to you.
Mac, can you hear me?  Come in?
Barnes?
It's time we lock coordinates.
You're not helping my heart condition any, Barnes!  Now just what the hell are you dragging your ass for?
This ship is going down in a blaze of glory!
Well if you knew it then why did set your thrusters on before making the calculation?
Goddamn it Barnes this really steams my onions!
Now I got enough air and supplies to make another complete orbit in the pod!  You're just gonna have to pick me up later.
Well...I don't mind.  I can put up with it.  I'm taking six months off after this, and I won't have to deal with people snapping their fingers at me.
Well, more power to you.  Me, I start to bug out after too much time out here.
We're going to die.
It's getting hard to breathe...
What are we going to do?
I don't think you know what you're talking about.  Besides, what could we use for tools?  A steak knife?  A corkscrew?
Supposing we could get out of this room?  Is there anything we could do to reach the bridge?
Can't we access the mainframe to check the ship's condition?
It must be oxygenated if we can hear him.
Are you ready?
Explosive?
Taylor?
Do you want some advice?
Don't worry about what will happen, just concentrate on what is happening.  You'll live longer.
I guess I owe you a debt of gratitude.  You saved my life.
What's that?
We don't have enough suits to get the others out.
What do you mean?  What happened!
I would, but no one can perform the ceremony.  I guess it doesn't matter.
I'm fine.
Where's Taylor?
Carlo!
I'm going back for Taylor!
I haven't quite made up my mind yet.
Yeah but the ship's mainframe doesn't. I need you to tell it something.
But the corridor outside this door is open, correct?
How is it looking, Mac?
Is it safe for human transport?
I'm an addict. I can't go through a day without the stuff. Theo reaches over and pours for him with a steady hand.
You a mini-golfer?
Hey, cut it out Sid, that tickles. I'm serious! You guys are related, right?
After we ID, we bury the body. Case and casket closed.
Fazeli...I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.
Hey, you still here?
Your pop said to put these on his tab. Sid gets up and jerks his thumb towards the door.
Bowling used to be so pure, so...All- American. Breeze sings along with Caruso and pretends to conduct.
You got an 8-track tape player on purpose, just 'cause you knew the only thing they had on 8-track was fuckin' opera.
You know, Elvis bowled.
Yeah, and make it extra muddy, I didn't sleep a zee last night. Sheila fills a cup. Buzz lifts it to his mouth, his hands trembling.
I don't know no Grace Skinner.
You're a bullshit artist, that's what you are. You got no right to be here! Theo yanks the trophy away from Buzz.
Millie left to stay with her sister in Ronkonkoma.
Theo.
What the fuck is this?
What makes you so sure it was me? She coulda had lotsa bowlers! Theo rushes Buzz and grabs his arm. The two men struggle for the pin.
That's a laugh. You're all strung out. You're a bowling junkie.
You never even took the shot. You couldn't do it. Theo moves towards Buzz in a threatening manner.
Thanks, kid.  Where are you goin' now?
Hello?
You sure you're OK Teddy? You're not bowling are you?
How's that?
Uh...over easy.
It depends.
What did you do to Buzz?
Come on Sheila, knock-knock.
I have someone for you to play Blueface with Junior.
That's some pinfall. Almost a 133 average. Her ball's flat, she needs to work on her spin control.
Nice set-up.
What if he wants to get out?
Rac. R-A-C. Renovate, Automate, Computerize. That, my boy, is the future. One of the monitors shows a little girl bowling. Her ball moves so slowly it barely tips over the first pin. Kastle hits a key and the pins explode in an emphatic strike. The little girl jumps with joy.
You need a sponsor; I have influence. I could sponsor you.
You're just like you mother! Always jealous!
Don't go near the bowling alley.
Like this?
Get that outta your mouth!
He's not here.
Here Theo, it's the Fazeli specialty; a seven-ten split. Theo looks down the lane and sees the two pins standing.
Mind if I cut in?
You and your sideburns are the talk of the party, Theo.
I wanted to be a motocross champion. My folks didn't really care what I did. Then Junior blew a fuse and I became their last hope. Most girls get ballet stuffed down their throats, I got bowling. I never understood how anyone could take it so seriously. I hope I'm not insulting you.
Ha! And what do you have to do for him?
It wouldn't bother you if Buzz was in danger, would it?
Yeah, what did Buzz Fazeli ever do for you?
You know how people with broken bones know when there's a storm coming?
I can't tell you, Theo.
I can't - I can't do it.  He's my brother.
What makes you think you know me so well that you can give me an ultimatum? Huh?
You think I'm dumping you to get back into bowling. Well who's dumping who?
Lane's closed big fellah, league night.
Who identified the body?
Fletcher, get away from there...
Fletcher!  Now!
How big is this spacecraft?
There's heat coming the door.
Alright, Beth, do that thing you did before.
Not everything.  Even on earth.  Take ... yeasts.
Norman!
They told me about sixty hours.
Back at the door -- I asked you to back away.
Fifty yards and closing.
We're a habitat.  Not a castle.  The only defense we have is High Voltage.
What was that?
Come with me.  The team's already waiting.
Then why am I here?
Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?
Off the record, I don't mind telling you, this thing scares the shit out of me.
Harry's missing.
I'm not paranoid.  I know Beth.  She can be drastic.
'81, I think.  She tried again five years ago.  I thought you should know.
You don't think weapons are important?
What the hell?  It shut us down.
We know how this craft got here. Where it's been.
To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere.
Man is man, all he knows is man, and all he can think of is what he knows.  The anthropomorphic problem. Good, Norman.
You don't know that.
Gimme a report, I want --
Who is that?  Where's that coming from?
Not now, Beth.  Please.  I want to know who we're talking to before we start talking.  Where's Edmunds?
She wired this system.
A half a mile long?
Captain, you know, I really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television.
Some sort of lead or something.
How can he be missing?
They switched us over.
I want a name.  A real name.  This thing's full name, rank and serial number.
It won't register.  It's too big to image.
That ULF report everybody's patting me on the back about?
Just keep your mouth shut, alright? This could mean everything to our careers, you know that?  Don't jeopardize this.
Wait a minute.
You knew about the squid not being normal.  Before Fletcher went out there?
Yeah, he <u>told</u> you.  Think.  What was Barnes doing before they cut that cable loose?  He was on the phone. Except that cable is a thousand feet long, Norman.  They would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out.
In Edmunds' things.
Where are you going in such a hurry?
You get it straightened out?
You think it's me?  You think I'm saying there was a conversation when there wasn't?
Remember when we first spoke to Jerry, Barnes kept asking for Jerry's real name?  But Harry never would?  He didn't because he was afraid the screen would say "Harry", instead of Jerry.  We weren't talking to an alien intelligence when we talked to Jerry, we were talking to Harry... or a part of Harry.
When did the messages start?  The animals outside start showing up? After Harry came out of the sphere.
He acquired some sort of power.  A power to manifest things.
Ulcers.
A synthetic opium analogue.
Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.
Three to six hours.
It's getting cold.
You don't think I put something in it, do you?
Are you manifesting them?
Then why, Beth?  Why go in?  Why put out explosives?  Why manifest the snakes?
Someone did.
Beth you're losing it.  C'mon.
I promise --
Beth --
This is what I'm talking about, Norman.  Don't you see?  It's in you. This vindictiveness.  This rage.
Of course you're going to deny it. You want to blame someone else.  You want to blame Beth.  Because you hate Beth.
Where is it coming from, Beth?
Stop it!
It's empty.  Why would someone build a ship like this?
When he woke up, he said we were out of food.  He told me to get some from the ship.
Jerry.  Right.  I said Jerry, didn't I?
You're staring at me.
You holding up alright?
C'mon.
C'mon, Norman.
Don't be so optomistic, Harry.
It's what's in that sphere, isn't it, Harry?  Whatever you think is in that thing -- you think it's going to kill you.
I could never read that far.  I never wanted to.
Thank you.  My suit -- Beth said she fixed it --
Navy transmission.  They're sent from Wisconsin.
That's right.
I can't reach her.
Missed.
Hold on.
C'mon, Norman!
Her legs are in the way.
Less than a minute, we're never gonna make it.
How's that working out, by the way?
The power allows us to manifest our fears, right?  What if we feared the power to go away?
Easy Ted, we're not mining gold.
Alot like.  You know, I noticed it before, but I didn't...
A spacecraft half a mile long -- with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it?  Someone went to a lot of trouble.  Try again.
Why would this ship carry instructions in English?
An American spacecraft?  Half a mile long?  And buried 400 years?  Yeah, good theory, Harry.
We take a weeny little wedge, bang on it a couple of times, and bust off a chunk of the metal.  Yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity, say 200 miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it's gonna be like hitting concrete, it would crumple like paper.  But there isn't a dent to be seen anywhere.  Not even a scratch.
Good idea, Ted.
Captain Barnes wants to see you right away, sir.
You mean they haven't told you yet?
You've heard of me?
Strange, isn't it?  In the middle of the ocean no less.
Try this one.
Well, he's polite.
You want to put him on your couch, Norman.  Grill him about his childhood?
Well, I can't imagine five years of unemployment --
No, not anymore.
Well, for one reason, we don't have your other five thousand.
That's straight through the central core... up toward the top of the city... Once you've got her, avoid the main transports, they'll shut down immediately.  Your only chance is through the service shafts. There are no sensors there... All right now, get going, you don't have time.  I hope you can remember everything.
I... I'm not a Bendu Officer.  I'm not even a startrooper.
You saw through me?
When a creature dies, the force it generated remains.  The Force is all around us.  It can be collected and transmitted through the use of a Kiber crystal.  It's the only way to amplify the power of the Force within you.
We don't have that kind of money. How much do you think I can get for the speeder?
This is the last place.  Shouldn't we just take what we can get and think of something else?
Have you been checked out?
As close as we can make out, it appears to be a Corellian gypsy vessel... It's not under power.
Where are you taking us now anyway?
I don't see how we're going to find anything out here.  This terrain is hopeless.
Well, I practice a lot...
It's only light that doesn't affect it.  Solid things, like rocks, can hurt it!  Fire above him!
I noticed you were having some problems, Blue Five... I thought I'd help.
The... ah door's jammed.  Give us a few minutes to get it fixed.
No!...
What is it?  What's going on?  Where are we?
I am Luke Starkiller at your service.
First thing tomorrow morning you're going to check those condensing units on the south ridge.
Tell me where you've been.  I am going to become a startrooper and fight in the wars.  My father was a Jedi!  Were you in many battles?
According to my father's tapes, this is the spot where General Kenobi lives, but the instruments just don't match up with the landscape... There is no doubt about it, we're lost...
I can't make it.  You go on, master Luke.  It doesn't make sense for you to risk yourself on my account.  I'm done for.
Let him have it.  You're winning anyway.  It doesn't make any difference.
Level five, Detention block A-23, cell 2187.  She's still alive...
See Threepio... do you copy?
You're back.  What happened?  Never mind.  What's going on?
Wait a minute, slow down!... That's better.  They're where?  They what? They are?  Oh, no! We're going to be mashed into conduit before this is over...
Holy Maker, Threepio.  I forgot...
Our love will grow, dear, year by year...
You still haven't kissed her yet ? Don't lie.
Don't think about it... go on instinct.
Ten of clubs. You still gonna sign up for Starside R&D ?
I don't believe it !
Please continue, Sergeant.
In simulation, my supervisors could never keep up.
Or...?
Thanks. You read my mind. Third watch always seems to last forever.
Profile's wrong... there.
Let's disregaed rank... Everybody hear that ? Rank is not an issue here.
I was thinking. Maybe we should get married, Carmen.
If we're gonna be a team, why not be a real team ?
Zander, what are you doing ?
Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.
You can't walk me home.
Well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come we're such good friends ?
Wait, I want to talk to Mr. Rasczak.
He just got accepted to the Fleet Academy. Isn't that great ?
Zander is going for pilot, too.
Johnny Rico, you're jealous !
Everyone's looking... we shouldn't...
I love you, Carmen.
Games & Theory ? That's Military Intelligence... Oh, Carl !
Let's all make a vow. Let's swear we'll always be friends no matter what.
What's wrong with you ?
You look so... I don't know, you look like you've really been in it.
Take care, wilya Johnny ?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAA !
Alright, take her out, Ibanez.
What ?
You still gonna play for Brazil ?
What's that, Diz ?
Way to go, amigo !
C'mon...
Why did you go and do that ? He was all ready to go Zegema Beach !
No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all. He sorta discourages you really.
Gillespie, put in call for retrieval. We're off this rock. Gillespie, do you read me ?
Owen reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago. That's why MICOM wants onsite assessment.
The Marauder power suit will prevent serious injury, but if you are hit, you will be non-operational and your team score will suffer accordingly. Rico, has each member of your squad completed a weapons safety check ?
Is that your signature, Rico ?
Well, of course you should come home immedietly !
On whose authority, Corporal ?
That would mean a comlete disregard for the mission objective. They hang you for that, Rico.
Can you walk ?
This is Rodger Young... What's going on down there ? We're taking plasma ! We have Orion P-11 as clear !
Inside 4th brigade compound ? That's crazy !
You. Tell me the moral difference, if any, between the citizen and the civilian ?
Find the Creator? <U>What</U> Creator? <U>Whose</U>...!?  What does V'ger want of the 'Creator'... ?
Kirk-unit, <U>why</U> do you not disclose information?
Within you are memory patterns of a carbon unit. If I can help you revive these patterns; you could understand our functions better.
You'll stay aboard as Executive Officer... a temporary grade reduction to Commander.
We'll have to replace Commander Sonak. I'd still like a Vulcan there, if possible...
Granted.
I trust you will... nursemaid me through these difficulties, Mister?
Recommend defensive posture, Captain: Screens and shields.
The fault is here, sir, not in the transmission.  The antenna leads have been disconnected. V'ger never intended to accept a transmitted signal.
Exactly.  And you did have a 'relationship' with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander.
Forward motion, Captain...!
Mr. Spock, what would V'ger need to fulfill itself?
That you left? or that you didn't say 'goodbye'?
Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, sir.
Time to impact...?
Mr. Spock?
Ahead Warp One, Mr Sulu.
Viewer ahead.
Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu; ahead one third.  Full sensor scan, Mr. Spock; they can't expect us <U>not</U> to look them over now!
Admiral, I've been hoping to see you. Maybe you can get through to those thick heads in Starfleet that...
You've reported that you felt strong thought emotions. A group of minds from a space vessel? Could you make out any plan, anything to do with Earth?
No vessel could generate a powerfield of this magnitude...
Child...!?
V'ger plans to literally <U>meld</U> to reduce both itself and the Creator to patterns...
Warp Drive as soon as possible, Mr. Scott.
Engineering... Status, Mr. Scott?
Dock control reports ready, sir.
You're doing a <u>Play</u>...
Northern Books.  What can I do for you?
The people in New Hampshire.
I quit.
That's good.  That's really good.  You have a gift for words.
You like my play.
Why?
Could you tell me when's the next train?
...that...he <u>sees</u> that...
So that the Old Mill, the Old <u>Mill</u> represents...the wheel of fate is that too...
For example, he's just come back from a <u>fire</u> and he...um...  That's a fine house.  You look at that, and you know, there's nice people that live there.
...such a pleasant sound.
They decided, I decided to, to...You love what?
And here's some hydrogen peroxide.
"To the love of my life, Love, Doug"?
Don't you think you should put them in water?
Why?
...yes.
Hi.
No, that's true.
Yessuh.  Joseph Knights printshop. Vacant for thirty years.
Would you like to <u>see</u> it?  I've got the key back at my store...
What am I gonna do?
But it'll stop the movie.
What are you going to do?
I'll wait for you...I'm proud of you. I'll <u>be</u> waiting.
S'Okay, Maude.  You know your lines...?
Well, I for one, am glad of a little diversion and I'm glad they're here...
Hi!
It's all over between us, Doug, I'm sorry, but that's the truth.  I've found someone else, and, it's very serious and it's the end.  I'm sorry.  It isn't <u>you</u>, j...
It's all over between us.  I've found someone else.
Maude, this <u>man</u> wrote this <u>play</u>!
Yes, Maude, it is.  It is a <u>very</u> good play.
Mornin', Doc...
He had a hard day.  Ann's deserted him for some guy on the movie.
Town ain't got no courthouse.
It'll hurt the box office.
Wat...
<u>This</u> is your movie, this is small town America.
A jacket for five dollars...I can buy this town for fifty bucks.
I will.
How big is this horse?
That's right.
Okay, look, you, what is she, 19, twenty...oh Christ...
...upset and impressionable...  Get me the Mayor...
Whyn't you learn your lines?
How old are you?
Nice town that you've got here.
Her...
I mean, okay, fine, but it's a motion <u>Picture</u>.
Tell it with...
What I...
Alright.  Let's...  Page five, the fucking <u>horse</u> dies.  You know, <u>she</u> could be in the movie, she could, she's got a good face, she could be the Doctor's...uh, why does it have to be his, uh, <u>wife</u>...?  It could be his...
So you see what I'm <u>saying</u>...the movie is about <u>purity</u>...
If your memory was as long as your dick, you'd be in good shape.  How long since you almost went to jail for this shit?
I have to ask you these...um.  You have a valid drivers license...?
Well, now, Mr. Barrenger, I'm very sorry, in fact, I'm as sorry as I could be, <u>but</u>...
It's a formality.  Any case of damage to city prop...you hit the control box of the new stop light, and...  They'll, uh, these things <u>happen</u>, I hope you're alright, and that you're feeling...
I've got scene <u>twelve</u>...  Shouldn't you be in school...?
Aren't you ever in school?
Nobody.
No.
I want you to hear this.
You have no right to...
You can't treat me like this.  I'm not a child!
Look, look, I like you <u>very much</u>...
Hi.  I hope I'm not disturbing...
Claire, when did you...
...I can't do it, Wally...
What?
That's cor...
-- she's got 'religion.'
Kiss my ass.
What?
Where you off to?
...little woman has gone crazy about our dinner party...City Council...?  What's the trouble...?
He didn't have to tell...
Hey, you've gotta eat a peck of dirt...
Half a buck I'd close it down...it's per...you know, it's perfidy, you got your Barrenger, molesting little girls...
Half a buck I'd put him in jail...
He saw the accident...?
...the finest people you could ever hope to work with...  You have the new Old Mill pages?
I...?
My <u>wife's having a baby</u>...
Does it have to be an Old Mill?  Where have you been?
We can't shoot the Old Mill.
I don't getcha.
Hi!
<u>Siddown</u>!
You didn't see it...
I...
My oh my.
Oh yeah, I'm really gonna eat carbohydrates...
What's in all the bags?
I don't got the money.
Waal, then, invite someone <u>else</u>, then...
My golly, you know?  All my life I grew up in the city, but every summer...would you like a cigar?
...the damn thing...
You think so?
But I couldn't r'member all the words. Ast them would they gimme a second chance.
Where are we?
We need a new name for the movie. Where's the writer?
Why?
&quot;Those who travel far and near this will make you DISAPPEAR!&quot;
...it's really not so bad Annabelle -- Red and Blue make purple.
<u>Never</u> say 'never' -- it's <u>not</u> fair to say 'always' -- and <u>no</u> name calling. Use your words.
I'm not upset.  Why would I be upset?
Daddy was washing Rachel.  In the shower.  What did you think that was about?
I'm a little tired and it's just a pick-me-up.
I can't hear you.
You wouldn't kiss him, huh?
This'll work, huh?
Thank God.  I got to see you. Grown up.
You forgot to wash my purple shirt.  I told you a hundred times it was Purple Day at school today.
You lost Ben?!
No.  I told you.  I like apple butter not butter butter.
I don't have to listen to you!  You're not my mother.
The timing was off -- I need this light.
Annabelle, I know you miss your mother.  So why don't you say hello.
Oh, baby, I'm so sor...
I <u>did</u> what she said.  I <u>used</u> my words, I <u>told</u> him what I <u>felt</u>, and they...
Now Ladies, the secrets to a great pie is the crust.  And the secret to a great flaky pie crust comes from less flour and more...what?
No they're not.
...your hating me.
...EGGzactly.  I'm putting on my coat --  We are late.  We are seriously late.  Which means Mister Ben we've got to get you dressed --
IS THAT YOU?
Queen of diamonds.
Ben!  Oh my Ben!  Are you alright?
You'll be up to your armpits in meatballs, I'm flying them in from Sweden.
Mommy, if your real name's Jackie and I call you mommy; and Rachel's real name's Rachel...Then when I see her do I say hi Stepmommy?  And if my name's Ben, how come you don't call me son?
Ben where do you have to get to?
Ben.  God doesn't like visitors.
It's not good enough.
People beat it, don't they?  All the time.
That's necessary, huh?
Why would his worry?  Or my children's worry.  Or anyone's worry.  Help the sit...
Napalm.
I'll call from work.  We can have a conference call.
You ask me that counselor's making a mountain out of a molehill...
Called him.  We set an ap...
I grew up, a little.  I'm ready for a life that's built around commitm...
You're still going to have to be dealing with me -- with us.  We should tell them together.
I had a lot of treatments, and they weren't any fun, but the tests show the cancer got smaller.
Luke was in the shower this morning and Annabelle sort of walked in without knocking.
Did you or Luke talk to her about it afterwards?
Get out!
She already hates me.  You've seen to that.
Sorry I'm late, I got lost dropping Ben off at Kevin's.
I'm sorry, I just...
What about obsessively picking her split ends?
...thinking of going back to Random House.  On a part-time basis.
...make some trips into the city. Sometimes, overnight.
I don't know wh...
Bi-coastal parenting.  Happens every day.  Luke gets the kids every other summer, every other holiday, it's not ideal, but people make it work, and...
Moi?
As you may know, 'going out' in the six grade doesn't mean shit.  They don't actually <u>go</u> to a movie or anywhere, they don't even eat lunch together, it's just a declaration to the world that they're...
You try to center on the big issues, y'know.  What it's all about.  What this whole trip has meant.  But then, the <u>really</u> big issues keep swamping y...
I'm thinking.  Do I know you well enough to really chew you out?
It's just not the right time t...
It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.
My advice to you?  Don't die.
Somehow, his blanket always looked like a cape, even the nurse said that.  He <u>loves</u> to hear that story, over and over.  How he was born a magician.
That thing you said before.  Pushing the guy sleeping next to you away. Because of what you gave up for motherhood...
Looks nice enough to m...
And I'm going to win.
Now, 'limp dick', I know.  What. Is 'snowballing'?
Because there'll be, oh, 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so.  And they'll b...
Actually.  They'll want Annabelle's mother.
You put filth in my child's mouth.
You taught my child that I am some limp dick <u>loser</u>.  Who didn't <u>care</u> about her pain.
You think <u>I</u> didn't have some dirty words for that little putz?  You think <u>I</u> couldn't figure out some low blows?
You've turned her into you.  And I may not get another chance.  To turn her back.
I love Luke, I love the children. But there is more to life than even love...
With good reason.  They fucking worship you as it is.
You know, there's nothing you have to say.  Because they know your heart.  You don't have t...
I just found out I have to go to Boston to get a deposition.  I might not be back until Saturday.
Look.  I know they hate me.
Oh my God.  Are you serious?
Everything's gonna work out.  The kids and I...we're going to love each other.
It's just an assignment.
Just like to make sure.  That your past.  And my future.  Are real different.
Why in the world would she t...
I needed some time away.
She called it a fight.  <u>The</u> fight.
Where you goin'?
I don't know what's wrong with that kid.
Well, I'm supposed to watch Schindler's List for homework. The movie's like almost four hours. And then I'm supposed to write a report on survivors.  You know any survivors, Dad?
There's something I need to talk about with you.
Consuelo?
Speak English.
You have a bay?
So whaddya think?
No, you don't.
What's an audience going to tell you?
Twinkeys!
Steak's really good tonight. SCOOBY  Good.
Not to be crass, but what do we get out of this?
Hey, you want to hear my short story now?
Well, I changed the ending a little.
So you don't want to hear my new ending?
What do you want?
Reconceive.
Get the hell outta here!
Dad?…Do you think that Brady will ever get better?
Hey, Mikey. You wanna get some ice cream?
Hey, Mikey!
Come here, give me a hug!
Yeah, uh, listen. Why don't you go upstairs and keep your Mom and Brady company for a bit? I need to speak alone with Consuelo for a moment.
It's a really nice place you have. Is the rent high?
Nigger.
Well, I mean...I wanna be on TV. Maybe have a talk show or something. Like Conan. Or early Letterman.
Hello?
Toby -? Oh, hi! How are you?
Great!
So what's going on?
Uh, well, anyway, so I'm looking for subjects for this documentary on teenage life in suburbia. Kind of an exploration of the mental psyche of its mythology. I wrote to Derrida to see if he'd like to do the narration. But everything's still kind of in development at this point.
Huh. Kids?
Is it loaded?
Scooby, don't! Be careful!
Scooby?
So like, yeah…I caved in. I mean, I had to. My parents, they're like …still really depressed about Brady. So I wrote the bullshit essay. Filled out the applications, did the interviews…Y'know, I figure I can always drop out.
Can I see what you have so far?
Uh-oh!  Do you know if the demands are being taken seriously at this point, or does Washington think these people are just a bunch of crazy fuckers playing games?
We got trouble.  That bodyguard son- of-a-bitch has them running all over the field--just took out three on the north end!
--be prepared.
Let me tell you something Cooper! I never once bad-mouthed him during all those months--
Well Filmore--
Are the labs in operation?
How's the arm?
Enjoying the tour so far?
You see, it paid off--you broke away from the old guard, congresswoman.  It won't be long till they're calling you Senator Filmore--
Come on, drink up.
Came over the satellite.  We're keeping the bird clear should they call back.
Well?
Apparently, this project is--unique. But it's heavily protected--all formulas are heavily codified!
Have you broken it yet?  We've got six more heads and that means six more hours.
I want the girl.  I don't care about the rest--but a US congresswoman taken hostage will make for great copy. We'll make headlines all over the world...
Are we adrift--
The source was...shall we say, completely reliable.
And now, Mister President, I must return at once to my embassy to communicate this reassuring news to the Premier.
Excuse me, Mister President, but you forgot to give me my camera back.
Give that back to me.
Sure I do.  There was some kind of mutiny on the base, and you killed General Ripper.
They told me, Major.  And I didn't hear anything about any atomic attack.
Now look, I'm picking up this ordinary telephone.  See?...Hello?...Hello?... Nuts, the lines must still be disconnected.  The General had us disconnect... 
Colonel, you're not drunk, are you, man?
Well, that's ridiculous.  If the teleprinter and radio links are out of order, just pick up a phone and pay for a call.
Under a condition red alert, the base will probably be sealed off and defended by the base security troops.
Well, sir, they may not allow the Special Service troops to enter the base.
What do you suppose is going to happen if General Ripper's planes start bombing their targets?
Yes, sir.
Youddon't think I'd ask if you recognized my voice unless it was important, do you, Major?
All right, Major.  I'm putting the base on condition Red.
You're a good officer, Major Mandrake.  You have a right to know.  It looks like we're in a shooting war!
Let me worry about that, Major. I've still got my red line to the Air Command.
What's the gun for, General Ripper?
Sort of like a new hobby, huh, General?
You know the regulations well, Major.
Don't fret about it, Major.  There's nothing anyone can do about it now.  I'm the only one who knows the three-letter code group for the CRM-114.
What shall we drink to, sir?
But when they do, sir, won't they hit back with everything they've got?
But then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people, sir?
I'll tell you what I do think.  If they say they're for disarmament, I say anyone who says they're for disarmament is either a traitor or a damned fool.
To peace on earth, Major.
Yes, sir.  The base commander, General Ripper, selected Plan-R?
General Schmuck, are you positive of your figures?
He says they've only shot down three planes.
Yes?
Is there any chance a single aircraft can penetrate the entire enemy Air Defense, when its course and target are known?
General, stick to the point, please.
All right...we're still flying.  I'm taking her down to the deck.
What else could it be?
He's right.  We wouldn't have started it.
A through H is correct.
Check.
Forty-five.  Still coming straight and fast. Twelve o' clock.
Between Mach 3 and 4.
If they come down low enough to make a firing pass, they'll never be able to pull up in time.
Well, listen, King.  Could you take her up to about eight hundred?  That'll help you come in at a nice down-angle, and it'll give us a chance for our chutes to open.
Okay.  Check these points.  Complete radio silence.  To ensure that the enemy can't plant false transmissions and fake orders, the CRM-114 is to be switched into all receiver circuits.  The three code letters of the period are to be set on the alphabet dials of the CRM-114, which will in turn block any transmissions other than those preceded by the code letters. You got it?
Lieutenant Toejam, are you ready for Bim and Bam?
Where'd they get you?
Listen, King, old buddy.  On behalf---
Shoot, Lothar.
What's your point, Lothar?
Check, all bomb circuits green.  Okay, Lothar.
Second safety.
Master safety.
Let's have a rundown on the damage, Lothar?
Yes, Major.
Where'd they get you?
How do you know he's dead?
What do you mean?
That's the point.
First lesson in War College:  Never under- estimate your enemy.
Who's that?
Maybe the warning system's out.
Lothar, can you arm the bombs for impact?
There's no other way, Lothar.  Can you re-arm the bombs for impact?
I think it's okay, King.  They should go off on impact.
Well, it would probably help if you took it ...sort of...straight down.
We're on course, Major.  Just fixed our position on that river back there.
I thought I'd go along for the ride.
King, would you mind if I keep me hands on the wheel when you take her in?
Thanks, King.  I've always wanted to take one of these big babies in.
Forget it.
Sure, King.
We are?
You know, one moment things are so fucked up than you look at it from a totally different angle and it makes sense.
That was really great.
Typical male.
Typical male.
You can see it. Whenever you want. Don't you, um, work at a hospital or something?
Any gunshot victims?
Sounds like a bummer.
Yeah, we could hang out and smoke a dube, you know?
Oh yeah? Oh, how'd you ship it over there, man? Federal Express? Hm? By the time it got there it'd be way cold and coagulated. Total waste. Cheese be stuck to the cardboard.
Yo, your gettin' me all upset here.
That sounds so depressing.
Go!
Fuck it!
Hey. Hey. Are you trying to get a hold of Sooze?
Yeah. Get ahold of Sooze?
She was at the Four Seasons last night, man. But you shouldn't worry about that.
Yeah, I should've stuck up for you, man, I know. You're my friend, she's your old lady.
No, I know what you're going to say. I don't know anything about making a video. But that's a plus.
Yeah, man.
Ow! Hey! Get the heck in there!  Hey... Not dead! Definitely not dead!
Fuck her! Come on, let's go.
Sure. You make art and you want people to see it.
Hey, come on, man! Limo!
They are old, we are young, they are fast, we are fun.
Oh, you were in the band?
Hey! Hey.
Score! Yeah!
Look, look, look. You gotta go now, okay? The customers complain.
It's safe, come on.
Hey, call the cops! Call 'em, call 'em right now, man. Maybe my cousin Jerry will show up. He'll definitely take your word over mine. You can tell him about the trespassing. I'll tell him about how you sell beer to minors.
Pakeesa? It's okay. Come on. It's okay. Come on, they're just joking around.
No, but I heard it was great.
So tell us, man. Party time, trashin' hotel rooms, babes around the clock?
You make videos?
Will you stand up for me?
So you came by to see how the other half lives, huh? Well, here we are, What do you think? Pretty fucking pathetic huh? Kind of like one of those documentaries on educational TV?
You got everything right but the car. My dad didn't get me a BMW.
A Porsche.
I'd like to.
Erica.
We could still talk, you know? It's nice to talk.
I love writing. A-Anne Rice? I love Anne Rice.
I'd love to read that.
It's coming along.
Buff, sit. You know what I mean though? Somebody ought to crack that guy with a baseball bat.
See ya later.
Yeah. Yeah, no, you're right. It's no big deal, you know. Guy probably has his arm around her right now, holding her close, nudging her titty with his elbow, talking about the deep significance of his music, while she looks up at him with her big brown eyes. In a few minutes they'll be back at the Four Seasons. You ever, you ever stayed in one of those places?
No, no, say it like this. Fuck 'em!
Oh, no, no, no. This is no big deal, you know? I can come down and, and get you out.
They let you out?
You lied to me.
Yes.
Oh no, no. You know what? Fuck that. No, you lied to me. You lied to me because you're gutless. You're a gutless, drunken looser.
You know, it's not you. You know? You seem like a smart guy.
Nazeer what?
This has nothing to do with me! She went up by herself. Yeah I tell them don't go on the roof! They can't go on the roof!  How is she?
Was that supposed to be me?
Oh, well, then you better listen to him.
God, KAREN JOHNSON.
I stand for honesty! I stand for some level of truth!
Can I talk here? Let me talk.
It was a racial incident.
It got that close.
Okay, what would you have done.
So what do you wanna do?
Taking one community college course on the history of Nicaragua, while barely holding a job packing boxes?
No, no, I have to talk to you.
Wait, wait, wait a minute, Sooze. What are you doing?
Wait, away?
To his hotel?
What about us? I'm moving away your staying here.
You did, huh? Good for you.
No, it's not...
Yeah, hey I saw your album at Musicland up at the mall.
Sorry.
You know, I've thought about that, actually.
Great.
Yeah, well, that's what I do too.
Comment, say things, think. Whatever. Why are you so special?
No, man. Hey. No, you know what? Hey, it's you, man. It's, you know what, you know what it is? It's this tarpit of stupidity that we're all stuck in. It's this cell. It's this void, you know.
George can drive us. There's plenty of room in the car. Jeff?
Hey, where's Erica?
Why should I call the police, huh? They don't so any good.
Get off my roof!
Ready?
I hope you're happy!
Sometimes, yeah. You know, I started to do performances.
Yeah, come on, play it.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I hate it here. It's so ugly, it's like being dead. You got out of here, you know? I'm ready to go.
Is that Jeff?
You know, my mom has this saying.
"Don't write any checks you can't cash."
Oh, How'd she get back?
About where she went. I mean, what bar?
Hey, great game Friday. Kicked Holbrook's ass, huh?
Yes, that's right. You know what, honey? You should go to New York. You should go. Go show 'em. They need your unique point of view.
Fucking drunk, huh?
It was the nicest thin I've done in a long time.
What?!
And you know real cops aren't half as smart as Keanu.
Another sex dream?
Di, we're sorry.  We...
Oh G-d, I'm sorry... You're not really fat!  I was just saying that because, uh, I thought that's what you wanted me to say.
No.
Di, it's Luce.  Kansas just called and said she's going to "fuck me up!"  Then I heard coughing, a thud and Kansas had to go.  I think her Grandma had another heart attack.  Anyway, why does she want to "fuck me up?"
Well, if I had to guess...  I'd say that was the sound of a mother saying good-bye to her little boy and hello to a young man who's going to be a daddy of his own...  Jack, do you know what I see here?
So, while we're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty "stinky" - in the long run, we're going to grow strong from this.
Nope.  Sounds more like the first.
Kansas!
NO!  Wait...um...  We're the A-squad from Lincoln High? So, uh...
Hey.  Eyes on your own belly!
She's been the weak tit on this mama cat since the beginning.
Hello?
... Ja-ck B-ar-t-le-tt... Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?
Oh please, we've all got bright futures ahead of us - we're not going to tell anyone.  Promise!
Yeah.  This summer at church camp?  I'm pretty sure I had, y'know, an orgasm.
Don't make me Jerry Lewis you guys for the rest.
All of you!
Bank branch!
My best friend got pregnant.
Kansas, I want you to meet someone special.
Where have you been keeping that gorgeous face of yours?
Judas E. Priest, who did you borrow that from? Adolphe Menjou?
It just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch.
Just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.
If I could be of any help...
Now if I got you correctly, there was a short stretch of my fiction you found worthy of notice.
I had a teacher like that once.
Who wants true? Who wants moving?
Hungry? After twelve years in the Burmese jungle.  I am starving, Lady Agatha -- starving for a white shoulder --
You won't.  I'll get us a refill of this awful stuff.
With a wildly beating heart.
Hello, Artie.  Good evening, Miss Schaefer.
Dark Windows.  I got him all hopped up about it.
It's not your career -- it's mine. I kind of hoped to get in on this deal.  I don't want to be a reader all my life.  I want to write.
You sure have.
What has Artie to do with it.
Good for you.  You've got yourself the best guy in town.
It's just impossible.
And don't make it too dreary.  How about this for a situation: she teaches daytimes.  He teaches at night.  Right?  They don't even know each other, but they share the same room.  It's cheaper that way.  As a matter of fact, they sleep in the same bed -- in shifts, of oourse.
Sure.  Especially with lots of music underneath, drowning it out.
Who's Norma?
I'll say.  This is solid gold.
Look at this street.  All card- board, all hollow, all phoney. All done with mirrors.  I like it better than any street in the world.  Maybe because I used to play here when I was a kid.
Why not?
From Artie.  What's wrong?
Stop crying.  You're getting married.  That's what you've always wanted.
All right.  I'll give you a few more clues.
Hello, young fellow.
Did you see them? Did you see how they came?
Goodbye, young fellow.  We'll see what we can do.
We've missed you too, dear.
That's what I want to talk to you about.
I am big.  It's the pictures that got small.
They're dead.  They're finished. There was a time when this busi- ness had the eyes of the whole wide world.  But that wasn't good enough.  Oh, nol They wanted the ears of the world, too.  So they opened their big mouths, and out came talk, talk, talk...
Ssh! You'll wake up that monkey.
Who else ?
They will love it every place.  Read it.  Read the scene just before she has him killed!
Of course it is.
What for?  I can say anything I want with my eyes.
There sure is.
You'll like it here.
What's that?
I want to talk to you for a minute.
I need some money right now.
Now what is it?  Where's the fire?
How about some evening clothes?
Shouldn't we wait for the others?
Not on the same floor with Valentino!
Don't bend back like that.
Hold me tighter.
Keep it.
What right? Do you want me to tell you?
To fall in love with you -- that was the idiotic thing.
Did she read the script?
I hope you realize, Norma, that scripts don't sell on astrologers' charts.
When did he say it, Norma?
What are you doing, Joe?  What are you doing?  You're not leaving me?
The rest of the jewelry is in the top drawer.
See, you didn't believe me!.. Now I suppose you don't think I have the courage!
I just put my car in the garage. I had a blow-out.  I thought --
Suppose you listen just for a minute -
This room has not been used for a long time.
There is the bathroom.  I put in soap and a toothbrush.
She was the greatest.  You wouldn't know.  You are too young.  In one week she got seventeen thousand fan letters.  Men would bribe her mani- curist to get clippings from her fingernails.  There was a Maharajah who came all the way from Hyderabad to get one of her stockings.  Later, he strangled himself with it.
That's what I told them.
Uh-huh?
No, I haven't.  I suppose all the waxworks are coming?
All right, Gillis.  You've got five minutes.  What's your story about?
So they tell the kid to throw the World Series, or else, huh?
There's nothing, Gillis.  Not even if you were a relative.
Paramount studios.
It is not Mr. deMille in person. It is someone by the name or Gordon Cole.  He says it's very important.
What is the scene? Where am I?
But the Power Source, Zaltar.
What does it mean?
Bianca, try not to be so bloodthirsty when you're at the wheel. OK?
Is he your entertainment for tonight?
Next time, remind me to do this out in the yard.
I don't want much, Selena. I have simple tastes.
Western Europe.
Is this Nigel's doing?
Wait...don't leave me in here...
What's happening?
We can't do that.
I'm not mad at you.
Hey! Ethan!
Hey, I thought you were gonna mention us upstairs.
I know it.
Nurse! Nurse!
They want me. Doesn't it make you proud?
You sure are a good cook, Selena. Man, that looks too pretty to eat.
Nice to meet you. Lucy's told me all about you. Your cousin Clark taught me everything I know about the newspaper business.
Gosh, what do you suppose .that is?
Oh, Jimmy, can't you forget about your career for one second?
I had to dump the papers in a trashcan. The Danvers have been arrested!
I can't help it if men notice me.
I've been in love with you for years. Remember how you used to visit your sister in the newsroom? And put your fingerprints on my lens.
I am almost an adult. This is what I want.
Even I have trouble with that sometimes. Earth is in outer space. And we're in inner space.
You see, a tree is a living thing.
I'd rather not talk about it.
No thanks. You go on.
Linda babes! There's this all-night party at Eddie's... his folks are away...
Who are you ?
Where is inner space?
What is this place?
I was on Earth...
That horrible woman!
Zaltar, please help me.
Yes, mustn't stop.
What?
What are you talkin' about?
Not enough vodka in it.
Got vodka in it now. Gotta give it a new name. Hey, listen, you thought it up, we'll name it after you. What's your name?
Say, Brad. I think he'll be better off doing it his way.
You shouldn't say that, you're the chairman --  ...uh, chairperson...
I can't  Clark already asked me.  Didn't you?  He used to love this song.  Didn't you?  So he just said --  "Would you dance with me?"
And three years after the Royal Wedding, the King abdicated.  Isn't that terrible?
That's easy to say. But how? And what about Ricky?
That song. I remember one day I came into the music room and you were fooling around at the piano. And I thought -- what am I going to do with all this potato salad?
It isn't only that he's small for his age. how would you like to be the only kid in town without a father?  Look at him, he's stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon.
No, all the good ones are married. That's why Brad thinks he's God's gift to women. This woman anyway. He's single. He won't take no for an answer, but he's the only one who's asking. And he knows it.
Peanut butter and jelly.
Gee, I always loved porch swings.
Well...  Not quite like this.
Mr. Kent! Superman was here!
Do you really know Superman?
Mr. Kent, could I ask you something?
Hi. Mister Kent.  Guess who Mom's having dinner with tonight? Superman!
You're the best, Lois.
Ah yes, August Gorman. Have you looked for work this week, Mr. Gorman?
Thirty-six weeks of chronic unemployment, thirty-six weeks of living off the taxes of hard-working citizens. Do you know what you are?
Man, what is this?
Under different company names. I control the price of coffee beans in Brazil. The price in Venezuela. Java, South Korea, North Korea, the Aleutian Islands, Guam, Bolivia, and the Republic of Gabon!
Columbia.
But Mr. Webster...you're doin' okay with Brazil and them other places. What's wrong with just one little old country doin' their own thing?
Always making yourself beautiful for me, aren't you?  So, Gus, can you make Vulcan do what I want it to? You didn't answer me, pal.  Did you hear about that prison riot last week? It seems they were complaining about rats in the cells...
When?
Hey, boss.
And do nothing. Just sit there.
Is this whitemail?
Not like this one you ain't. Nobody in the world got one like this 'cause it don't exist yet. We got to build it.
I told you it wasn't no jive.
Stone mutha.
Can you do that?
How you doing down there?
That's up to the judge, Gus. It's not your problem anymore.
Hey listen, I didn't know your mama was comin' by...
Oh. I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.
Well, don't let me keep you from anything.
You! Activate circuits 29 through W7 and start Full Power Coordinates on Exterior Defensive Systems:
Okay? Goodbye.
85,000 dollars.
I just remembered the rest. There isn't any more. The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet.
And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...
He's coming! He's going to hurt me!
Jimmy, how's the -
Are you okay?
Lois, why don't you at least get one of those automatic ones?
'Magic Fingers.' Fifty cents.
I don't know, they look pretty happy to me...
Lois, I don't have the vaguest idea -- as usual -- what you're --
Who ????
You don't have anything to be sorry 	about.  How could I . . .
Let's go to my place.
Blood . . . my . . . blood . . .
Maybe we ought to hire a bodyguard from now on.
I have to go back . . .to the Fortress . . .
Hi.
Sleep well?
Lois, someday --
See what happens when I don't have my orange juice?  The human body is only a workable, fairly fragile machine when you treat it with the same respect you'd show to ----  . . . gee . . .
. . . Superman?. . . . .
Mush!  Mush!
This way Lex.
Artemis? Do you read me?
Isn't that what the old Canaveral guys used to call a comet on an East-West trajectory?
Game plan! It's fourth down and long yardage, the two-minute warning sounded and the ball's deep in our territory! How brilliant do you have to be?!
OTIS, your brain defies any known scientific laws in its infinite capacity to deteriorate. Every man has a vulnerable point. Some like you Otis, have more that one. I didn't see Superman's in time. But now through patience, invention and skill, my 	black box is just about ready.
So --  I hope you like it.
I knew you'd double-cross me, Luthor. A lying weasel like you couldn't resist the chance . . .
Put down Lex Luthor !
Hey, let's be fair. Actually, there've been two or three times --
And now they are willing to release the rest of the hostages?
Then we must go there too.  To rule. Finally - to rule!  And then you shall have what you want.
You are master of all you survey.
Did you really believe we would give up our advantage?
You're late. Very late.
My prom was so boring. We all flew to Paris the next day to recover . . . Sometimes my whole life seems boring. I thing maybe I should just give everything away and go live among the poor people. Then I remember how smashing I look in sable . . . oh, it's all so confusing. You think I'm silly, don't you?
I feel kind of light-headed . . .
Oh . . . my . . .
Hi. Is dinner ready? I'm famished.
Daddy's offered me jobs at some of his other companies. But, I've been thinking maybe I'll take some time off.  I'm going to find a place like Smallville, in the country. Maybe a  farm . . .  see what the slow lane is like.
Any more like you back home, Clark?
You'll find a good man Lacy. You deserve one.
Regardez.  Voila Monsieur David Warfield.
. . . Please leave your message at the beep.
But Superman isn't an average man.
Well, I don't understand.
Would you mind waiting for me in the visitor's gallery?
But you can't tell where one country begins and another ends. You can't see any borders. It's just . . . one world.
Darling, it's good riddance. Let her go. And while you're at it, fire that Clark Kent. He hasn't been here in days. He hasn't even called.
No, Daddy. Our business is journalism. We can't continue to be so irresponsible . . . or else we'll just lead everyone into a disaster.
Is he for real?
But all men like me, Lois. I'm very rich.
Clark. He's late again.  I can't figure him out.
What's he going to say?
Where's Clark?
Are we going to skip the country, Uncle Lex?
He missed the door, Uncle Lex.
Of course! That's his one vulnerability. The one way he can be stopped.
We'll all fry.
Don't worry honey, I'm sure he'll make a swell husband.
Me? Now? With Superman dead and you on my team? It's like I'm the coach and you're the best power forward ever. What could I have to fear?
Stop! I command you . . . you mutant!
Guess who? It's your old friend, Lex.
If you have any social skills, you've learned them from a rattlesnake. Just what are you up to?
Your time in prison has twisted you into a delusionary state, Luthor.
You'll be designing monuments soon, Albert! Hotels! Palaces!
That the planet blew up on May 23, 1937. That the rocket ship with the revolting little freak in it took three years to reach Earth. Ergo?
Ah! The guest of honor at last! And about time, too!
But Mr. Luthor, sir, I already  --
Me?
You'd better get a new alarm clock. The chief has been hollering for you.
Clark...Son...that...thing you did with the Sheriff today... those...stunts...you don't do those things at school, do you?
Mom...
Your bookie?
Big night coming up?
There's no real proof that tobacco  --
What'd you call him?
Oh, what a chance! If I could just  --  get to him.
You! The girl from the volcano!  Kryptonite...
Couldn't we forget the plane? You could lift me in your big strong arms?
Shut up.
Damn!  This will get him.
Krypton!
I'm going to bed.
The door jam, Miss Teschmacher. This Ethiopian shmendrick here, in his simple, unconscious way, needed something to wedge the door open, the better to inhale the flies that form such an  important part of his diet. So he grabs something from the table...
Ready?
She knows. Clever, very clever.  And unappreciated. But I'm going to take you away from all this.
Oh. Why? does he live up here?
Need I ask who's favored to collect at the end of this week.
Well - gotta change that tire if were gonna get home.
We'll say he's a child to my cousin in North Dakota, and just now orphaned.  Poor thing.
It's the only logical conclusion. If he remains here, he'll be as dead as...
They are primitive, Lara, but they are not animals.
No! You couldn't imagine -
Who...who...
Wha'...what are you doing here?
Okay. Let's start with these strange powers of yours.
How old are you?
Can you really see through anything?
Do bullets really bounce off you?
Do you like pink?
Where do you hail from?
Now then, Otis. Did you get what I asked for?
But, to someone from the planet Krypton, this substance would be lethal because of its high level of radioactivity. Kryptonite! Ah, Kryptonite! That's the stuff!
Cleaning a rock, Otis?  Jot it down. As soon as we're back, he feeds the pets.
Now who's the dreamer, Superman? Even you can't fly that fast!
Ally.  That's right.
And what does he do again?
We're...not together.
Which one?
I don't remember the name.  It was near a beach.
But you said...
What happened?
I don't know.
Why would he do that?  You didn't have anything to do with the accident.
I don't see how that concerns you, Billy.
Well, it being so depressing and all.  But it's reality.  You can't just turn this off because you happen to think it's a bad idea.
Because it's what we have to do.
It's not enough.  For hospital bills.  For Nicole.
Nicole's coming over to look after the kids tonight.  She'll be there around six.
She said she's got to be home by nine.
Yes.
Mr. Stephens says that someone didn't put a right bolt in the bus...
Why did you do that, Billy?
Dolores.  No one calls me 'Mrs. Driscoll'.
From what?
No, nothing like that.  Billy's wife, Lydia, died of cancer a few years ago.  He took over raising the children by himself.  It was obvious how much he missed Lydia.
Abbott and I used to do a lot of that in the spring.
I have a question for you, Mr. Stephens.
You've talked to Billy?
And Billy told you that he'll tell that to...
It's clear to me and other people that you have suffered significantly from this event.
Good morning, Wanda.  Hi, Hartley.
What do you think?
But Dolores said she saw a dog and tried to...
How was it?
Your Dad spent all his spare time in here.  He wanted to make it absolutely perfect.
Maybe we shouldn't be talking about this just now, with you barely home. Aren't you hungry, honey?  Want me to fix you something?
Nicole!
That was Billy Ansel on the phone. He wants to come over to talk to us.
What's vermin again?
Nicole?
Nicole?
Because...he wanted to them to be punished.
I don't like thinking about the accident.  I don't even remember it happening.  Besides, it just makes people feel sorry for me, and...
It would be strange if you didn't feel that way.
I don't want you to lie.
There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole.  Not in a situation like this.
I object to the form of that question.  Note that.
Note my objection.  She said, 'As I'm talking.'
I have no questions.
What about Doreen?
That's great, Wendell.  That's the sort of thing I need to know.  So it doesn't come back to haunt our case later on.
Yes.
Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe.
What do you want me to do, Zoe? I'll do whatever you want.
Do you have the blood test?
Oh God, I'm scared.
I'm sorry about that, Mr. Stephens. Would you like to try the fish?
We do.
Yes.
I'm a lawyer.
The Walkers spoke very highly of you.
Yes.
Dolores?
You think someone else caused the accident?
Are you a reporter?
Been drinking since high school. Fucked himself up.  Used to be smart enough.
Now on that morning, did there come a time, Nicole, when you left your parents' house?
I will offer that report.  Well, then, now that your memory seems to be clearing, can you tell us what else  you observed at that time?
Mrs.  Driscoll was driving too fast? What made you think that, Nicole?
What's so funny?
They say I'm lucky because I can't remember the accident.
Do you like the colour?
It's because of the accident, Nicole.  Most people in this town whose kids were on the bus have got lawyers.  A lot of people...well, people in this town are very angry. Us included.
He couldn't look at me.  But I looked at him.  Right at him.  His secret was mine now.  We used to share it.  But not anymore.  Now, I owned it completely.
You ought to stop this nonsense, Loretta, these two dollar bets.
That's right!  Tell him, so I can read it in Hunsecker's column first!
Will you mind your own business!
Excuse me, Steve.  I said namely you shouldn't go around wild, blaming people without justification.
That's a lollipop that, boy.  The kid is only great.
You don't know that lunatic yet? Whims - egotistic whims!  Like the gag - when you got him for a friend, you don't need an enemy!  That's what the fight with Bartha was about. "Leo", I says, "Hunsecker froze me out.  So I'm eating humble pie this month - please print me an item."
I hate J.J. -- but not that much at this moment...
Blessings on thee, the both...well... Gotta run now.  See you two kids later!
I don't take kindly to you and Falco selling me ethics.  Who's the injured party here, you?
If looks could kill, I'm dead...
Not being partial, are you?
It's just as if I've seen a ghost today...
Let me finish, dear.  You had your say, now let me have mine...
Susie likes to keep her girlish secrets.  But in her heart of hearts I imagine, Dallas, that she fancies you in an uncommon way. Now, what about YOU, son?  Not just tom-catting around...I hope?
Susie, did you know about this accusation...?
You in a mood, Susie, to run over to Milgrim's later and buy a few new frocks?
Hello, Harry.
Yeah.  At Bellevue.  Still hanging on.  But they still don't know if she was pushed.
Say hello to Sidney Falco.  Tickle him - he's been a bad boy tonight. He called you my fat friend.
Mac!  I don't want this man at my table...
What, some cheap, gruesome gags?
Yes, with your clients' names attached.  That's the only reason those poor slobs pay you - to see their names in my column all over the world!  Now, as I make it out, you're doing ME a favor!
Spahish...that must show he likes "spigs", too.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think so...
Awright, that brings us up to five weeks ago. "Sidney, I got a nasty little problem here." Did I say no? I'm frank to admit - it don't jell as fast as we like... But all of a sudden I CAN'T GET YOU ON THE PHONE NO MORE!  WHY?... And why, as of this date, am I frozen out of the column...
Can't hurt?  I had to get him back his job.
Well he's got her in a tizzy, I'll tell you that!
I know...I know you're the strongest cop in town.
It's nice, Sidney, that you give me this tip...
Well, I'll be darned.  And what does J.J. think he SHOULD do?
Bribing me again?
We're old friends, Chickie - quit it!  A big columnist comes in this room, without his ball-and-chain and you make like a delicatessen counter!  What did you think would happen in his house?
Do you still keep your key under the mat?
Rita, say hello to Otis Elwell.
Yeah!
This sort of thing!
A girl needs a little romancing before she -
No, an arm, he said.  I told him you were sure the item would be in Mr. Hunsecker's column in tomorrow's...
I wish I could help in some way, Sidney.
Go home, Sally.  It's late...
If that's for me, tear it up!
What's the matter?
You're talking very fast.
Did you now?  On which bounce?
Where do you come off to make a remark like that?
Do you think J.J. likes Steve...?
It's not my nature, Susie, but I'll talk to you like an uncle...
Listen, get a good night's sleep - tomorrow's another day.  Feeling sorry for yourself won't help.
Yeah!  Like me!  I don't choke on my own gall - I fight back!  Let THEM choke, not me!
I know that bit - you're a girl; you need a man to give you strength! So what do you pick such weak sisters for?  Don't you know yet that you fight fire with fire, not with tear drops?
Don't run away - I was always the man for you!  I'm talking to you out of two years of silence - listen to what I say!  Inside of six months -
Steve, my brother isn't as bad as he's painted.  He isn't perfect, but -
But he could be reporting back to your brother, couldn't he?
And on Monday, I'll take it off and stroke your light brown hair and -
Steve, I...
But I thought... aren't we changing things?  I mean... right now?  Changing the way it goes?
Please... let... the kids... go...
My God.
Holy shit... you're really real!  I mean... whoah!  You're, uh... like a machine underneath, right... but sort of alive outside?
Radical.
Like it could disguise itself as anything... a pack of cigarettes?
We spent a lot of time in Nicaragua... places like that.  For a while she was with this crazy ex-Green Beret guy, running guns.  Then there were some other guys.  She'd shack up with anybody she could learn from.  So then she could teach me how to be this great military leader.  Then she gets busted and it's like... sorry kid, your mom's a psycho.  Didn't you know?  It's like... everything I'd been brought up to believe was just made-up fantasy, right? I hated her for that.  But everything she said was true.  We gotta get her out of there.
You have to do what I say?!
Everything.
That's great!  See, you're getting it.
You don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other?
Pain causes it?
Alriight!!  My man!
The T-1000 has the same files that I do.  It could anticipate this move and reacquire you at Dyson's house.
Mom?  You okay?
It's okay.  It'll by okay.  We'll figure it out.
I know!
Kyle, don't go!
You're already dead, Silberman.  Everybody here dies.  You know I believe that.  So don't fuck with me!
Can it be destroyed?
... it's... like a giant strobe light, burning right through my eyes... but somehow I can still see.  Look, you know the dream's the same every night, why do I have to --
On August 29th 1997 it's going to feel pretty fucking real to you, too!  Anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gonna have a real bad day, get it?
Where do you stand on all this?
And no elbows on the table!
I guess you admire musicians.
You think a whole orchestra, what, a hundred and forty or so guys, could be orchestrated?
Yes, David?
When you question him again, could you treat him with more respect?
Major, he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect.
I'm gonna get that fucking bandleader, Colonel. No deal. No fucking deal.
You do shorthand and typing?
Okay, let's see. How long were you in the camp for?
Says here because of your father. What's that mean?
Bruckner's Seventh, Major.
Then why did you conduct at one of their Nuremberg rallies?
Did you call someone you knew?
I have a list of names here, people in your profession, who got out in '33. Bruno Walter, Otto Klemperer, Arnold Schoenberg, Max Reinhardt...
I've got to hand it to the British, David. You know what those guys are?  Decent.  Tell me, Herr Dr. Furtwängler, do you know Hans Hinkel?
What did Goering say?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Von der Null?
That's an outrageous lie!
Helmuth Alfred Rode. Second violinist since 1935. What's it mean, second violinist?
Oh, we didn't play for his birthday, we played the evening before - it was the 19th of April not the 20th.
I hear the British have his... his archive, files, records.
Major.
And I see what you mean. You nearly poked my eyes out.
Great catch, kid. The boy runs off.
Edwin von der Null. Music critic. He gave Furtwängler terrible reviews while he raved about Herbert von Karajan.
You ever seen Adolf Hitler's eyes when he was making a speech? I've seen 'em on films.
Do you know who Arturo Toscanini is?
He's as big as Toscanini, maybe even bigger. In this neck of the woods, he's probably Bob Hope and Betty Grable rolled into one.
Conscientious, determined, dogged.
Rudolf Otto Werner. Wind section since 1936. What instrument did you play?
Dr. Furtwängler is a great musician. He actively opposed the Nazis and later on he helped many Jews to escape.
Yes, that's true, but he refused to give the Nazi salute. He kept his baton in his right hand. In Hitler's presence. That was a brave act...
Mission control to Chuck, come in...
The Uzi 9 millimeter.
I had him hooked.  He was just about to ask me out. I could tell.
What do you think?
Great.
Alright, the beige one.
But outside, it's living human tissue.  Flesh, skin, hair...blood.  Grown for the cyborgs.
This is gonna make me puke. Talk about something.
Sleep.  It'll be light soon.
About what?
Thanks a lot.
Well, we're gonna uninvent the bastard.  Eighty-six it.  We'll blow up the place...burn it down.  Something.
Is this enough?
That's good.  Now, seven more like that while I make fuses.
A girl.  You know.
So much pain.
I can help you...
Yes, but I don't want to leave.  I think this guy's following me.
Go ahead.  You're safe.  There're thirty cops in this building.
Give me the short version.
Send a unit.
That Silberman just crack me up.  He had this guy in here last week who set his Afghan on fire. Screwed it first, then set it on--
It is so very inappropriate for you to mention my father.  Or, did you think this, between us, was friendship?  Just because you went fishing with my father, I should sit on my hands while you throw my money away?
Did you play recently?
Christine!   Mister Van Orton is a valued customer...
I'm so sorry.
Don't help me, just get more napkins. And soda water.
Terrific.  I now have a hundred dollar dry cleaning bill.
Excuse me, I need to explain...
What's with him?
Alright... okay...
You've got to be kidding.
There's got to be a flashlight.
You deserted me.
There goes a thousand dollars.
They're watching.
You can talk while I drive us to the police.
They did the same to him as they did to you.
All I mean is... someone like you...
I don't know.  A lot.
Who is it?
What are you <u>doing</u> here?
How deluded can you be?  There's no <u>why</u>...
Where'd you get that... ?
What the fuck are you... ?
Guess you missed it.
No, now wait... think about it.  What did you see... ?
Okay... okay...  I put it down.  Now open that door. Mister Fisher's right on the other side of that door.  He's an actor...
Julliard, yeah.
Yes.
Never better.
Call that number.
I thought you'd like this.  Best thing I ever did.  If you don't want to do it, DON'T...
What's this all about, Connie?
Calm down.  Why would they keep playing after you paid?
How do you know?
I'm sorry, Christ, I'm sorry!  How many more times do I have to say I'm sorry before you forgive me... ?
Split it?
It would mean a lot to me... if you and I could be friends.  If I could have you back in my life... in some small way.  It would be important.
I'll explain someday.
V-A-N... O-R-T-O-N...  A gift from Conrad Van Orton. Interesting...
Oh... it's a game.
We provide whatever's lacking.
I've been so lonely.
You did?  How is he?
Mr. Van Orton... ?
I don't know what you're talking about.  What's happened?
All the time I've known you, you've never once asked about him.
Your mother thought he was a good man.  He worked very hard.  What I remember most was his manner was so... slight.  It was easy to spend time in a room, and not realize he'd been there the whole time.
I'll send your regrets.  Honestly, why must I even bother?
I don't like her.
Just what I told you.
Christ... I can't believe it... invisible ink?
Bravo, young man.  you have to tell me what this was all about sometime.  I want you to know... when it looked there for awhile like you were going slowly insane... I was fully prepared to have you committed to the <u>finest</u> mental-health facility available.  I mean that sincerely, don't thank me.
Hi.  I'm Todd Aubochon.
These old Victorian houses are great, aren't they?
I only saw Theo drive up.
Modelling small-group dynamics in the formation of narrative hallucinations.  You brought us here to scare us.  Insomnia, that was just a decoy issue.  You're disgusting.
And this is my assistant, Mary Lambretta.
I gave my key to the gate to Todd, but the Dudleys'll be here in the morning.
The rest of you may hate your insomnia, but I find it the best time of the day for me.  I'm alone.  Nobody's talking to me but myself.  My mind is racing with ideas, and I can think.
Malcolm, this is essential work I'm doing.  Just think what my research can do for education. Elementary school classrooms near train tracks or airports, where loud noise is random; this helps to prove the need for sound insulation if the children are ever going to learn to read.
Sorry.
And then what happened?
Someone is playing with you.
You know what he's really upset about?
Here's how they're organized. Groups of five, very different personalities: scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for.  And they all score high on the insomnia charts.
This is where we're going?
What happened?
When do we take the tests?
She needs help.
Oh God, we can't get out!
Yes.
No one could.  No one lives any nearer than town.
Good night, Theo.
If this was some sort of joke, I'm going to kill him.
Yes.  I feel realy rested, too. Theo?
How could he have left without his keys?
Theo... Did you?
Marrow said the same thing as last night, he <u>says</u> --  -- that he checked with Mrs. Dudley.  And he says that she told him that all the fireplaces in the West Wing connect to the main chimney.  He says that he thinks that the flue was open, and with the windstorm, he says that what probably happened was some kind of freak air current --
Then who is?  Come on, Nell.  Deep down, if you really thought it wasn't Jim, why wouldn't you be leaving right this second?  Why wouldn't you be afraid?  Really afraid.
Not for you, clearly.
Am I a thing?
I'm not.
As soon as you get dressed.
I don't like do-it-yourself cuisine. Buffets.  Salad bars.
That's what Gordon's always saying.
Italian?
Not who, food.  Should we get Italian.
How'd you like to kill someone for me?
When you find the guy, you'll know.
What.
What kind?
I mean, Gordon must weigh a good four hundred pounds.
Where do <u>you</u> think he is, Mike.
No.  I mean.  Not even your people should be involved.  Right?  It's too close now.
You think I'm staying?
You broke last time.
I can take care of the paperwork.
I didn't expect anyone.
I didn't even know who I was writing to -- just someone with the same last name. She never talked about any family.
What more is there.
I go to work, try to keep my life together, put all that shit behind me, man.  What d'you want from me.
What you gonna do, man?  You gonna go to the cops?
Are you a resident of California? You gonna fill out forms, man?  Do the background check?  Go through a three-day waiting period?
You hadda show up on a weekend.  This weekend.  Wouldn't've even been a gun show ... for another month.
Now what.  You gonna take your new arsenal, go visit Terry Valentine, just like that?  Boom bam boom.
Valets.  What d'ya mean valets.  What is he, then, the Earl of fucking Doncaster?
What are we standing on?
Steady on.
Do you have any friends, man?
And not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out.  From the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it?  Pink Floyd concert receipts.  Jenny would've been ... fourteen at the time?
Weren't you on a television series?
Ashamed.
When I'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do double-duty as a voice coach.  Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress.  Not with that look.
She was twenty-one when she came to me.  ... Straight from leaving you.
I might've been away for the weekend.
I gave him yours.  Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative.  I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny.  Who told me she didn't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why.
The address Jenny gave me, that wasn't a prison, was it?
Do you even know who Terry Valentine is?
What line is he in.
Are you serious.
Terry's never going to give you satisfaction.  Not the type.
You don't seem bothered.
Oh, I was gonna say ...
What did you do?  To make them take the early 70's away from you.
I don't believe it.
How far?
That's where Valentine's scarpered.
But I can't be sure.  I don't even know who he is.  He's too insulated.  Too many layers around him.
That dude who works for Valentine.  He's the one sent those guys after you.  You know that.
But if you're mad at him too and he's mad at you ... that must make us pals.
Turned that place completely around.  180 degrees.
What I like about Ian, he believes in a chain of command, but not a chain of respect, you understand what I'm saying?
Yeah.  I really admire the guy.  Well. Good to meet you.
You'll be looking forward to getting back, then.
Been away a lot.
Ever take a look at the women who work in pet stores?  Wow.
Two blacks and a Mexican in a car.  Who's driving?
We coulda used the other two-and-a-half grand.
Like what.
What's in it?
You know her?
Is Valentine here?
Where's ... what's-his-name -- Fred --
Go to him.  Go to his studio, or writers workshop or artists colony, Esselin retreat, nudist camp --
She could've had the deal!  I would've handed it to her if she wanted.  I would have given her everything.
Hello, Ed.
Oh, I know. Don't worry, Ed. I came to tell you...
Ann--
Ann, will you come in, sit down, maybe have a drink?
Oh, in there? I messed up a little bit in the scherzo. I guess, if nobody noticed, it's OK. Mr Crane, this is Tony, a friend of mine. Tony, Mr Crane.
Hello, Mr Crane.
Yeah.
Anyway, uh... my point is you're young. A kid really, your whole life ahead of you. But it's not too soon to start thinking... to start making opportunities for yourself. Before it all washes away.
It's called dry cleaning. You heard me right, brother, 'dry cleaning'-- wash without water, no suds, no tumble, no stress on the clothes. It's all done with chemicals, friend, and your garments end up crisp and fresh. And here's the capper: no shrinkage.
I'm, uh, I'm--the barber.
Come in, come in, siddown over there. Coffee?
...You bring a check?
...Usually we do this kind of thing with a bank draft. But cash--that's fine--it's all the same in the end-- dough's dough, huh?
I got the paperwork here. Partnership papers here, they reflect our agreement: fifty-fifty on the net, I supply professional services, you supply the capital. I'll give you a receipt on the dough there, huh?
Pretty straightforward, but I don't know if you wanna show this stuff to a lawyer--
I guess it would be pretty awkward.
How much to they want, Dave?
That's my capitalization on the Annex! *My* operation, Ed! Christ almighty. That's what I was just talking to Doris about, a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from Ann.
Dave.
...Money problems. He's thinking about canceling the Annex.
I'm fine.
Yeah.
...Did you make that up?
Says here that the Russians exploded n A-bomb and there's not a damn thing we can do about it.
Jesus...
...How you today, Ed?
This is what family is for, Ed! This is when ya come together!
Barber, right? I'm Freddy Riedenschneider. Hungry? They tell me the chow's OK here. I made some inquiries.
...I'm Crane.
Hello!
OK, boys, which of you gets the privilege?
...Yeah, it's a tough break.
There are a couple of kids who were lost yesterday near the site of the murder.  Claimed they saw a monster. They're pretty determined to tell you their story.  You want to see them?
There's some kind of animal loose in the museum.  Pendergast's alone.  He needs help.  I want volunteers to go with me.
I had no idea the Museum had a complete collection of Piranesi's Forum sketches.
If the party goes forward, and that's a big if... I've arranged for a large police presence.
I got it after I was mugged in the subway last spring.
In every exhibition room.  The museum's divided into five cells. The reception and exhibit are in cell five.  We could arm the motion detectors in cells one to four, then seal the perimeter with our fire doors.
Ippolito!  Get back here!
Who are you?  The undertaker?
Vince D'Agosta.  Am I out?
Careful.  That mess on the ground is brains.
Lieutenant --
They heard the victim's name and wove him into their story.  Nice touch.
Pendergast!  Help!  It's right behind us!
Vince?  There's no way we can get to you with the fire doors down. There's an entrance to the sub- basement in the hall off the north side exit.
Look.  It's some kind of letter.
Dr. Green has to see you!
What's that?
What does it say?
What's that doing here?
No, Margo.  This is one problem you can't solve.  You have to stay out of it.  The fact is, I want to retire.
Yes it is.  I'm tired and I'm no longer needed --
Come on.  I'll walk you back to the elevator.
I can't help thinking there's something that Pendergast overlooked.  If the scratches were made by whatever killed Beauregard, it wants something that's in here.
All right, assuming the program is accurate, this is a description of the animal with that claw.  "Species unidentified.  Genus: unidentified.  Phylum unknown.  Male, weight in excess of 240 kg.  Brain capacity, 900 centimeters." That means it's highly intelligent. "Quadrupedal."
It's from John.  Those two arrows were his insignia.  It's addressed to Louis Moriarty, a patron who financed his expeditions.
Margo, this is too dangerous.  You always think you can solve everything.  This time you don't have enough information.  The animal might behave in unexpected ways.  Leave her here with me.  Don't put her in danger.
Dr. Frock, I was wondering.  What happened to the rest of Whittlesley's plants?
This room sucks.
We're not supposed to go back there.
We were just lost, okay?  And we went down this curvy staircase.  At the bottom was a big shadow.
Not that big.
They were yellow!
Stop!
Look.  It's Hobbes!  He's all right.
Jesus, what is this?
What do you make of it, Margo?
Turkish Gecko, I believe.  A lizard.
Not today.  Besides, I think the director of the museum is expecting you.
John couldn't have anything to do with a horrible thing like that.  He was a fine man despite his problems --
Yes.  Once.  We met at Columbia.  John held the Cadwalader Chair in Statistical Paleontology when I was a grad student there.
I don't understand.
My God.  Then it was an animal.
Where would we find it?
That's not what I saw.
But what can we do?  Our guns are useless --
It didn't want the fibers.  What does that mean?
For what?
You smell that?
We're not going to make the storage room!
No!  Don't kill him!  Pendergast, you were right.  It's John!
Just like John.  He won't listen.
I'm sorry to keep you.  How can I help?
Where exactly?
<i>Where</i> in Fiji?  What island?
Viti Levu.  For how many?
It's the busy season.
I thought you were in a hurry.
We've become tired of watching actors give us phony emotions, bored with pyrotechnics and special effects.  While the world he inhabits is counterfeit, there's nothing fake about Truman himself.  No scripts, no cue cards.  It's not always Shakespeare but it's genuine.  That's how he can support an entire channel.
Not only does he give us a glimpse of the truth, he gives us a glimpse of ourselves.
Yes, everything you see on the show is for sale - from the actors' wardrobe, food products, to the very homes they live in--
Why do you feel that Truman's never come close to discovering the true nature of his world?
You've never actually met Truman, yourself.  Never thought about doing a cameo--playing a veterinarian, or a priest, something like that?
We've learnt about life as Truman has and, despite the complaints of a minority, it's been an overwhelmingly positive experience, for Truman and for the viewing public.
The creator of what?
You take Japanese.
No.
You really think it could've dropped off an airliner?
I'm onto something, Marlon - something big.
It's hard to tell.  They look just like regular people.
Could be.  Beard looks phony.  It's when I'm unpredictable.  They can't stand that.  That's why we've got to get out of here.  Can you come with me?
No.
I went all over but I never found a place like this.  Look at that sunset, Truman.  It's perfect.
Hi, honey.  Look at this.  It's a "Chef's-Mate."  Dicer, slicer and peeler in one.  Never needs sharpening. Dishwasher safe.
Oh, God.
What're you doing down here?
Come on, Truman.  Haven't you studied enough?
I'll take you home, Angela.  Why don't you leave those with us for a while?
I invited Marlon and Rita for a barbeque Sunday.  I thought I'd make my potato salad.  Remind me--
That's right.  I do, don't I?
Truman, that was our house!
It's hard to go places, isn't it?
No.  You said, "Do something."  Who were you talking to?  Tell me!
How are you, Mother?
You know surprises aren't good for me. You should really call before you come over, dear.
Just listen.  You remember when you were a little boy, you stood up in class and said you wanted to be an explorer like Magellan--
Good.  Good.
Not supposed to talk about it.
Are you going to let us in on what exactly you're trying to prove --
I hope to. We're working to develop this evidence --
Of what?
Yes.
Is this Dr. Kurtzweil's residence?
Feds are looking for him, too.  Real nice business he's got, huh?
You looking for him for some other reason?
You want a call if we turn up Kurtzweil?
Do I know you?
You a reporter?
I think you're full of shit.
What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual battery of a patient? I've had my license taken away in three states.
I was right about Dallas. Wasn't I, Agent Mulder?
What was it?
Negotiating with whom?
And they tell me I'm paranoid.
You've been using me --
You didn't know my father --
I'm on the roof.
I know that. But the threat was called in for the Federal Building across the street.
Mulder...?
Now what?
Something's not right...
Are you drunk, Mulder?
You're saying the bombing was a cover-up. Of what?
How was it contracted?
And where are they going with it?
Hey, I was right about the bomb, wasn't I?
It may be extraterrestrial.
Been where?
Scully...
You don't see what's going on here, do you?  There's four hundred million dollars in damage to the city of Dallas. Lives have been lost. No suspects have been named. So the story being shaped is this could have been prevented. That the FBI didn't do its job.
Agent Mulder --
Are we being watched?
Where's Scully?
Is she alive?
What is it?
Aids, the ebola virus -- on the evolutionary scale they are newborns. This virus walked the planet long before the dinosaurs.
Why are you telling me this?
Let me out. Stop the car.
Find Agent Scully. Save her. Only her science can save the future.
We began to worry. Some of us have traveled so far, and you are the last to arrive.
We've allowed this man his freedom. His books have actually helped us to facilitate plausible denial. Has he outlived his usefulness to us?
Sing a song of sixpence...
I do it all the time!
I'd be there for him.
Don't bring it home in this.
Like a New Year's Day hangover.
Sometimes... Once they've been caught they feel a need for disclosure.  They have so much they want to tell. But they've never had a sympathetic ear. They need someone to understand why.  Stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully.  It was part of the ritual. Some weren't found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean.  But these last three... They were still in water - always in water - but  Listen, he wasn't just careless.  It went beyond that...
With Stargher I saw things...
What happened?
I heard Julia and John got married.
They're hungry.
Thank you.
Who says?
Oh no... No you don't.
She the one from Santa Cruz?
Lattimer sold the hoist to a guy named Bainbridge who tired to build a machine works out near Delano.  Bainbridge ends up in bankruptcy court and the state winds up with the land - it's just sitting there.
What about the legalities of this...?
Catherine!
I have done this, you know.  Been inside.
Any psychiatric medication?
Is she alright?
That's a secret.
How's the patient.
I need it.
How is she?
Right here.
Ich weiss nicht.
Hier sind fruher Fursten ans unt eingeganger. Hier hat sogar ein Metternich verkehrt...
His own doctor?
You shouldn't get mixed up in this.
What's she talking about?
Why?
Who are you looking for now?
The Porter is going to talk to us tonight.
I can try. Is it comedy, or tragedy?
Let's go away.
Sneak out the other way, and go back to your theatre. I'd better not see you again.
I wish I knew.
I'm going back home.
What happened to your hand?
...you know.
What is on your mind? Why did you hide?
Here, it will be cold on that train.
Of course I didn't tell Calloway.
That's the reason.
You know as much as I do, Miss Schmidt - you were intimate with Lime, weren't you?
Miss Schmidt, we know he is somewhere across the canal in the Russian sector... You may as well help us. In a few minutes Colonel Brodsky will be questioning you about your papers. Tell me where Lime is.
Here we are. You'll be all right here, Miss.
Where?
How will I know you?
What is it?
You a friend of Lime's?
Been here long?
You've had a bit of a shock, haven't you? You could do with a drink.
Must have known I was broke. Even sent me an airplane ticket. It's a shame.
Why don't you catch a few murderers for a change?
Listen, Callaghan.
Get the next plane.
I was on that side, the shadow was on that side, and no turnings on either side.
A girl of spirit.
Didn't I?
Wait a minute - let me out.
...his number.
Welcome?
They wouldn't know me.
How long can one stay here on this stage money?
...this lecture business, you'll put me up here a while?
Seems exciting.
I want to talk to you.
What do you want me to do?
You really liked it?
Well, there was only you, and this friend of his. Who is he?
Not necessarily. She'd probably want to help.
Vinkel...You've got quite a collection of er-collection.
...he was. Yes, for a short time, while they carried him across the road.
Baron Kurtz.
Not saw, heard...heard. I heard the brakes. Wham! And I got to the window and saw them carry the body to the other side of the er...er Joseph...that's Joseph Emperor Joseph Statue.
Fer von mir aus gehen sie zur gansalt aber mich lassen sie aus mit der politzei.
That's all you meant?
Wasn't he at the police inquiry?
What else did he tell you?
Third Man.
What's the purpose of your visit here?
Excuse me.
I'm Daffy.
I'm waiting on some money coming through. It's just that at the moment, you know, I'm short. They're going to chuck me out. On the street in Bangkok, that's bad.
Thank you, sir. Thank you. I promise I will repay you.
What are you doing in Thailand? Tourist?
You go to Patpong? See smoke from pussy, ping pong ball from pussy, razor blade from pussy; bird from pussy.
Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.
Richard, it's secret. That's the whole point.
Everyone ok?
Well to be honest, Etienne, I would rather have not known about it.
She is gone!
She just went under the water. She was pulled under. Oh God, I don't see her.
So from there to there?
Francoise -
Too far?
Do you know the Kentucky friend mouse story?"
Whereas Avi's a Zionist Nazi.
Read the early Zionists on European Jewry; they sound like Goebbels.
Fucking Danny, man...
That was an ark, man. That was a Torah. They fucked around with it, and the Torah melted their faces.
Do we have to listen to this shit?
It's called the flame alphabet. It's supposed to be the word of God written in fire.
This? This is a joke.  I'll give your group a thousand bucks.
You will.
The point is, the modern world is a Jewish disease.
Is he a Nazi?
You think people ever commit suicide out of happiness?
Bigger and better.
Va-yomer... And he said.  It goes the other way.
Why should I submit?
I don't know. I just want to try it.
No. What are you looking for?
Miriam called, looking for you. She said you might come, so I...
I thought there were people here....
...I thought we agreed, no anti- Semitism...it's exactly what we're trying to put behind us.... Trash the blacks, fine; but...
That would be a catastrophic mistake.
But when it comes out, the public will be outraged. It will look like Germany all over again.
They left an hour ago.  You mind some personal advice? Forget Carla. That's not the side your bread's buttered on.  How soon can you get back to the city?
We want to build bridges to certain positions in the political mainstream: works like <i>The Bell Curve</i>, <i>Sociobiology</i>, anti-Zionism, anti- immigration, the com-munitarian issue.... We'll hold conferences: invite liberals, blacks, Jews. Chomsky, Cockburn, Stanley Crouch, Shahack....
Is it okay if I record this?
My mother's family is French, my father's was German, originally.
You ever fuck a Jewish girl?
Jewish girls like to give head, right?
Yes. It's very pleasurable. But the Jews are obsessed with it. You know why?
Because the Jew is essentially female.
Deracinate... Tear out the roots. A people -- a real people -- derives its genius from the land: the sun, the sea, the soil. This is how they know themselves. But the Jew doesn't have soil.
Were you ever bar mitzvahed anywhere else?
I don't think you know what you are.
I always won.
You're telling me you killed him? You? Killed him? Bullshit. What kind of gun did you use?
It was a nine millimeter.
And only talked about killing Manzetti to convince them you were an anti-Semite. If you'd had any idea somebody would take it seriously, you never would have said it.
How did you get the fucking number?
Are you with the FBI, Mr. Balint?... Or any other law enforcement agency?
Hello...?
What are you doing here?
He's going to die.  He won't take his medicine. He eats dairy. He probably still smokes when I'm not around.  I asked him to come live with us. Alex offered to share his room, unsolicited.... But he didn't want to be any trouble.
Tell it to Hitler.
I'm doing a piece on right-wing groups, post Oklahoma City. I hear you're an important figure in those circles. You have a lot of interesting ideas....
What about Drake, did he ever show up?
Not too fast.
It's not going to be fine. It's --
Are you an artist?
How did you know they were Jews?
You can't say that....
After your mother died, that's when you stopped going to shul. Doing your homework. Everything.
'Cause they got rid of Johnson. He knew how to deal with the assholes. Dallas Green, please...
So what?
...May you be blessed in your going forth as you were in your coming....
This is good work... unfortunately it's incomplete.  Could you eat a sandwich 40 floors above the street.
Did the driver really freeze?
No!
Yes.  Of course.  Very wise.
The Italian, I presume?
I wish, but it's full.  They recommended a pension in town. They say that all of Taormina is full.  What's going on here?
Where did you two meet?
I might have known.  As I was telling you earlier, I'm the world champion free diver.
Little.  Very little.  And skinny, very skinny too.  That is compared to me.
Huh?  Well listen to him!  Do you hear that?
The Mamma's there too.
Jacques!  Johana!
Why?
Is he alright?  What happened?
In my village, we have a saying: when the wind blows, the flags of all nations flap in the same direction.
It isn't lit yet.
You don't mind if I go instead, do you?
That's good.  You never would have recognized me, huh?  Check out the suit! Looking good, no?  You know I'm the world champion?
Why?
I don't want to be in any competition... I dive because I like to, not to beat a record... don't you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him?
You're the best, Enzo!
I don't have one.
It's okay, Enzo.  I'll go somewhere else.
That's good.
It's okay.
Madame...
Why?
... Everything.
Tell me, why don't you go and get your medal?
You'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable?
That's good.
... How long was I asleep?
Tea... or whiskey?
Yes... Maybe... I don't know.  I don't like competitions... It ruins the fun.  Don't you think?
I'd better get back now.
Jacques, you set a world record.
Then, tell me a story.
Do you know how it is?  Do you know what you're supposed to do to meet a mermaid?
And you?
What are you doing?
You've got to tell me what happened?
This is the hotel San Domenico?
Why don't you ask me?
Did you buy the cassettes?  The Wagner, the Berlioz?
Good.  That way I'll see more of you... Where are you going to stay?
In my apartment?
Uncle Louis, you remember Enzo's mother Signora Molinari from Amorgos?
What were Italians doing living in Greece anyway?
How was your trip?
I thought you said he was Peruvian?
What is it honey... the frenchy?
What are they for?
Will he understand Spanish?
Alright Mordechai, now that we're alone I just want to say that I'm not happy about this. I don't want a repeat of that incident in the West Bank.
Chief, it's me. Listen carefully. I need for the Worldwide Jewish Media Conspiracy to mass produce video copies of every Hollywood movie ever made featuring a positive Jewish protagonist as its lead.
Please. Will you help me?
Hanukkah, Shmanukkah. It isn't even one of the high holidays. What concerns me more is that my boychick is almost thirty, and has yet to settle down with a nice Jewish girl.  I'll make you a deal. I'll help you with your little Hanukkah problem if you help me with my Mordechai.
Mr. Jefferson Carver?
From the way she carried herself I could tell she'd been around the block a few times...
How is old Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal? Is he still shtooping every girl he can get his hands on?
Any sign of Santa?
That got annoying fairly quickly.
So, now what?
What was that!?
Also, on a daily basis, I want you to tell me what to do, where to do it, and how I should live my life.
Your mother was right. You do work too hard.
When did you guys have this conversation? When I was in the bathroom? What else did she have to say?
Esther!
Let's let your tuchus breathe.
...and the opportunity to help my brothers and sisters in the Jewish community.
Well I have news for you mom. It is good enough...I'm good enough and I won't leave here until I hear you tell me...
Hello Mazel Tov! A boojee boojee boojee boo...
Happy Hanukkah Tikva.
What are you doing?
I shlepped all the way to the North Pole for this? I come to fight you, and you don't even put out anything to nosh on? What kind of arch nemesis are you?
What should I charge?
So what's in the boxes? Heroin? Cocaine?
Why do you ask so many questions? What difference does it make how Carlos and I feel? Feeling does not buy clothes and houses!
This is for "mama and the kids."
That cat ain't mean. I feed him out of my own hand for six years. Why don't he kill me? At night in the truck, I let him out of the cage. When I am falling asleep I hear him walking back and forth. I go to sleep. He don't hurt me.
They don't say it to me.
Sure.
Charlie wasn't drunk last night.
Two hundred and fifty dollars you owe met
And here is Three Tree Mesa -- and here I go out of the big arroyo --
Cut.
Something black —- something on its way to you ——
The death card - -
What, senorita?
It may sound like music to her -- I can do better with my teeth in a cold Shower.  Click — click — click.
I mean you being a star and me being just a cigarette girl.
Well, I'd best be off.
Come to look around?
Charlie and I were talking. That's one reason I wanted to see you.
Yes, but what sort of a man?
Jerry told me you were an expert with animals, Mr. Galbraith. Couldn't you tell where it went?
What do you do now?
That was unfortunate.
Yes, there is something wrong. People who want publicity and don't mind how they get it --what risks they make other people run - - what agony and sorrow they bring to other people --
I've been trying to tell him, Sheriff. He won't listen to me.
Yes. The lipstick.
No —- not yet.
That's easy. Me.
No —— not yet.
You look swell in that three—alarm number --
I suppose he was trying to make me feel bad.
Who was the other man?
Who is he?
Pretty. You know -- it's funny but flowers only mean one thing to me now.
Why do you want to stay around here? It'll only make you feel badly.
I got into a little crap game.
Mrs De Moraes must have taken it hard, eh?  Her brother’s death.
For your information, Mr Lombard, trouble is possibly the one thing Leon is capable of getting into all by himself. Though I doubt he will not ultimately fail even at that.
I found this at your brother’s.
It’s a snuff movie. Prime paedophile material. I’m told it retails at around £4,000.  I see you don’t require a definition.
Your brother got mixed up with child procurers  and tried to make this world a better place, Mrs De Moraes. And having rescued one little life he unwisely set out to repeat the exercise.  You don’t mess around with child procurers. Right now my guess is he’s either on the run, held captive, or dead.  I understand your misgivings, Mrs De Moraes. But I’ve seen the boy and made telephone contact with the man Leon bought him from. If anyone knows what happened to your brother it will be that man. Which leads me to why I’m here at such a late hour. I need £20,000, in cash, by 11 this morning.
I will of course do my best to hang onto it.
How dare you...  You don’t know this tape belongs to my brother, do you, Mr Lombard?
Get out of my house. You’re fired, Mr Lombard.
Laurence!
Thank you for coming. Come in and close the door, will you?
You lost my money?
I’m impressed. That information could have cost me £20,000.
Mr Lombard. Mrs De Moraes...
I... Well, we’re burying Leon tomorrow and... Look, I wish I had more time, but it’s late and with the funeral...
You do have a vivid imagination, Mr Lombard. I only wish you’d use it fruitfully instead of in being obnoxious. I fail to understand your purpose in this. Still, say what you’re owed if you still wish to be paid or get out, all right?
Whatever the reason, I’m sorry I did. Goodbye, Mr Lombard. I believe you know your way out.
Huh! Don’t you recall convincing me he had?  You should learn to live with your mistakes, Mr Lombard. There is some merit in it.
Your brother stumbled upon Adonis’s little secret, didn’t he? And traded his silence for a kid and some cash. And Adonis fell for it, bought him his kid, sent him away, and then killed him when he came back for more.  Leon didn’t come here to borrow money for prints. He came to extort a second kid’s life. Your flunkey let him in, so his visit couldn’t be concealed, hence the exhibition story. There was no exhibition. Just as you suspected. Remember, Deborah? “Leon does his own prints. Wouldn’t want anyone to interfere with his ‘Art’”.  I should have paid more attention to your words. Perhaps it’s the way you say them...
We all have to like what we become. Cowards included. We achieve this by complicating things a little. But it’s never that complicated really.
Do you think the boy you saved might identify your husband as his purchaser, Deborah? And then, your brother’s not buried yet. As I said earlier, an autopsy will...
Why the hell couldn’t you divorce the man?
There’s nothing wrong with the line, sir. Are you sure you have the right number? 770 471 is the number of a call box.
The word for those things is croissants.
You wouldn’t have a cigarette, would you?
By your Austrian?
You don’t know why he’s come to Los Angeles?  The man you say he killed? Who was he? A colleague of his?
You know where to look for your Austrian, right?
A recent acquisition. We’ve had four break- ins this year alone; files stolen, computers wrecked, faeces smeared on walls. The good guys dismiss us as alarmist do-gooders; the bad guys will risk prison to intimidate and rob us. An easy living indeed, Mr Lombard.  I got through to Moreau and Jane. I left your landlord out of it. Your flat’s been broken into. Jane wants you to call her back.
A little too tight, eh?  ...They were my son’s. Only thirteen and already six feet tall. A real lanky boy...  I... There’s some cold chicken salad in the fridge if you’re hungry.
Right... Well, I’ll get your money first thing in the morning, okay?  Okay. Goodnight then.
Route 395. Past Edwards Air Force base and about half a mile before a place called the Red Mountain Motel. There’s a dirt track with a ‘Closed to the public’ sign. It leads to some kind of ranch in the middle of nowhere. If you haven’t heard from me by morning send the cavalry, okay? But not before, you hear?
I’m finished here and I’m tired, Emily. You shouldn’t be here. Now don’t make it worse.
Damn it! You can’t fucking walk away from this!
...I’m Emily Stewart. The hysterical female who sees evil everywhere since the day her thirteen year-old boy disappeared. The pain in the ass who cries wolf at the drop of a hat. However I go about this that’s who I am. Do you get what I’m fucking saying, Mr Lombard?
Whitney Armstrong, my deputy. What Whitney’s trying to say is that you might not live to tell the tale next time you meet your Austrian...
Where is the Austrian?
Who’s the money man?
Where are the kids?
And who does Friedman work for?
What company?
What’s the Ambassador?
What colour is your car?  What colour is your car?
Hello again, neighbour. I didn’t intrude, did I?
“La collectionoose”. It’s about a young girl in the south of France who seduces a different man every night and then meets one who resists her. It’s on TV tonight and as I’m in I thought we could perhaps look at your accounts and... The review says it’s about the conflict between intellect and instinct. And witty. The director’s supposed to be famous. Rommel or something. French. You must know him?
I don’t know. How many famous French film directors can there be?
I’ve got work tonight, Jane.
No... I told you on the phone. Whoever broke in messed-up all your papers. I put everything back where I thought it ought to be.  Maybe it’s there with...
Just ask if they can recall recommending my services to anyone in the recent past. Say you’re my secretary, all right?
Hello, Jane. It’s me.
Good afternoon, Mrs...?
Good. Now, as I trust you may have guessed, we are looking for someone to work for us. Someone whose discretion can be relied upon. Someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment. Do you think you could be that person, Mr Lombard?
How did you do that, Mrs Spitz?
So he could have decided to go on a trip...
I’m sure... As far as you know, when and where was your son last seen?
What happens now?
Where is Friedman?
This car needs petrol.
Is it real?  You people are sick.
What are you talking about?
I gather we’ve done business with a friend of yours?
Will you be alone?  The merchandise. Is it just you or...
We didn’t quite make it as lovers... Leon is a good man, though...
He just said he had good reasons.
Is she on the phone?
Did he ever refer to the hostility between them?
He showed me a book with a picture of a couple caught kissing in a street...
Oh. That’d be Rhian, a Welsh chick he used to lay at weekends. She got wise and dumped him months ago...
Yeah. Why? You’re going to look for her... Shit! You really think his pictures are that good?
Alors?
Le montage, l’emballage. Not your regular street muck, is it? This is collectors’ stuff. How much would it cost me?
Why did you kill Friedman?
Why did you kill him?
Are you telling me Friedman didn’t tell you I was here looking for him?
What sums?
Are they still operative?
Ha ha... Yes. With prices reaching an all time low, the name of the game has become ‘have-it- where-it’s-at’... As we all know, transportation has always been the costliest and trickiest part of this business...
What do you think?
What do you fear most now... my sword?  ... or his hands?
He didn't tell you to cut all your hair off...!
What did they say?
Not so... easily.  Why aren't you... fighting...?  go on... we're almost there...
The king said you're his finest archer...?
I'll go.
Jeanne... the king has ordered us not to ride with you anymore.
The truth is always simple... it's you, Jean, who's making things complicated.
So... even you don't believe in me anymore...
That's not what I asked... Why do you want to marry me?
What did the king say?
It's a trap!  They're buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from England!
Will you at least let me stay with you?
We must sound the retreat!
Do as I say!
I'm already free...
We have to press home the attack!
It was on a Sunday, wasn't it?
I understand your impatience, but if you want this trial to be acknowledged as legal we must follow correct procedure and...
It is not for us to burn her, my lord.  That is your prerogative.
You won't be able to drag anything from her that way.  You also must realize that many of my colleagues are... well, scared...
Whose side are you on, Cauchon?
Quick -- hide in here...
Trial?  What trial??
Were you baptized?
Tell us, Jeanne... do you often hear this voice?
I know, Jeanne... it was the only way to save you from the fire!
Not so well, I regret to say.  This business with the Maiden... it's caused him endless grief and torment.  That's why he's entrusted me with the task of... shall we say...
This word is -- regrettably appropriate for the situation.  In fact what we -- the Church -- wish to do is determine whether or not this girl is sent by God, as she claims.  You understand that we cannot allow just anybody to abuse God's name in this manner...
Who better than a messenger from God to give answers to your questions?
Supposing she's an assassin?
... as always, majesty...
When you saw your king for the first time, was there an angel over his head?
Then why did your king believe in you without any proof?
It is all his majesty can afford. He has even donated his very own personal savings.  His majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families.
8,000.  We can't raise more... We can only place ourselves at the mercy of your generosity.
Good.  Where are the English?
It's coming -- I rode on ahead.  I have to speak with the Captain of the English army... his name's Talbot...
Wait, wait...
Well.  I'd love to see that, but after taking counsel with my captains, I felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city, then wait till Alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything.
"Be patient, be patient"... is that the only advice you can ever come up with??  I've shown more patience than a dozen saints!
Position the long-bows over there, crossbows over there -- and set up Dijon Culverins either side of those trees...
Stand by with the battering-rams...
Well...?  Shall we go?
The Dauphin -- he's sending us food -- and supplies -- and an army -- led by Jeanne -- the maiden from Lorraine -- isn't it wonderful?!
And... what does Jeanne think?
So you think you did well to cut your hair and dress as a man?
How can you deny it when you just said "I'd rather die than fall into the hands of the English"...?
And you didn't jump of your free will?
Take mine instead -- here -- smash mine first!
Jeanne... the man hasn't been paid for six months -- that's his only reward.  Let him take a few teeth...
When you were taken prisoner at Compiegne, did you have a horse?
Who are you to even think you can know the difference between good and evil?  Are you God?
Oh?  And just because you realize now, everybody else should forgive you?!
Oh, so you don't want war anymore? You want to be at peace?  You want to be able to change your mind anytime you feel like it and expect everyone to go along with it?
My... visions...
Why would they?
What signs?
No.  That was a sword in a field.
I don't agree.  Why do you have to keep changing your mind all the time?
Ah, pleasure... that's a difficult word to define.  When does the pain end and the pleasure begin...? When did your pleasure begin with that sword in your hand...?
Are you going to leave me too?
Yes...
Good, good.  And your sister... Catherine -- she's still your best friend?
Then... why are you here so often?
Him?
I don't want to wait for his call.
Someone you know?
A beauty. Who is she?
This is my husband. Wladyslaw Szpilman. Marek Gebczynski sent him.
Wladyslaw Szpilman.
Sit.
How long have you been married?
When's your baby due?
What did I tell you?
Will I still be able to play?
To tell you the truth, I thought it would be worse.
It's not going to be very comfortable.
I'm on the run!
What's happened?
Calm down, what, what is it?
Funny time to say this.
Henryk's in there.
Believe me, they've picked him up.
I've no money.
Boys, boys...
You know what we do? We use psychology.
But...they won't get all of us... we'll...it's too small...there's four hundred thousand of us in Warsaw!
It's not funny.
You go to Heller, did I ask you to talk to him?
It's nothing to do with you. It's me they wanted, not you. Why do you interfere in other people's business?
What's that mean, no employment certificate?
What are you reading?
The Germans are advancing on Kharkhov.
Five hundred. You know how many people on average read one copy? Twenty.  That makes ten thousand readers. These will start the uprising. Majorek hides them in his underpants. And leaves them in toilets.
Jurek? Wladek Szpilman.
Fine, we're fine, thank you, and you?
And what do you think you'll do while you're setting up a new line of defence? Wander round lugging your suitcases?
I'm sorry, I did my best, I thought the certificates would save us all.
You don't remember me, Mr. Szpilman?
What the hell are you doing?
Where are you hiding?
I don't know how to thank you.
What about you?
Ohhh, it's so dark, it's like a dank cave.
I knew she was mute, but now I'm thinking it's more than that. I'm wondering if she's not brain affected.
Oh, yes, yes of course, a concern.
My REAL father was a famous German composer
Those 80 acres, that cross the stream, what do you think of them?
Good, flatish land with reliable water, why? I don't have money. What are you about?
What for?
I don't think you should have given up the piano. I will make sure you are properly taught, with music written on to sheets and...
She wants to see what you can do.
Everyone has to practice.
What?
What's in here then, lead?
I know why Mr. Baines can't play the piano.
Which way are the rooms?
I think I'll keep that to myself. Which way are the rooms?
Visitation is still up by two at the three-quarters.  Single Action second, Fasanella third.
Yeh, go ahead.
It don't look good, gramps, it's ten of now.
How 'bout a handkerchief?
...It's the only reason I ain't quit before now.
I'm gettin' too slow for this racket.  I done the best I'm gonna do.  You hang on too long, you start embarrassin' yourself.
It's nothin' compared to what you could be makin' on the Big Con. You're wastin' your time workin' street marks.
Straighten up, kid.  I wouldn't turn ya out if ya weren't ready.  I got a guy named Henry Gondorff I want you to look up.  There ain't a better insideman alive.  He'll teach ya everything ya gotta know.
I'm out, Johnny.
And tell Cole I wanta see him when he gets in.
Granger, this is Combs.  Why haven't we heard from ya?  Everybody else is in.
Hey, Luther told me he was carrying a wad, but I didn't figure this much.
I thought you blew all your money.
Doyle, can I see you a minute?
It's important.  We had a little trouble in Chicago today.  One of our runners got hit for 12 grand.
I don't know.  Could be.  We're runnin' that down now.
They're still looking for him.
Name's Danny McCoy.  No Neck McCoy we called him.  Runs a few protection rackets for Carnello while he's waiting for something bigger to come along.  Me and Danny been friends since we were six. Take a good look at that face, Floyd, cause if he ever finds out we let one lousy grifter beat us, you'll have to kill him and every other hood in Chicago who'd like to do the same thing.  You understand what I'm sayin'?
I've had it with that bum, Floyd. Stack me a cooler.
We bought ya a tap into Moe Anenberg's wire.  He's got eyes at every track in the country.  You'll get race results, odds, scratches, pole positions, everything; and just as fast as Western Union gets 'em.
You gonna stay for breakfast, or do you already know how to eat?
Gondorff, you gonna teach me the Big Con or not?
Aw right, he runs the numbers outta the south side.
This isn't like playin' winos on the street.  You gotta do more than outrun the guy.
You know how easy it'd be for one of Lonnegan's guys to nail you?
What's the matter, kid?  You're not sayin' much.
Looks like he's sulking.
Look at that.  He's got four apes with him.
How ya doin'?
My end was only one.
Excuse me, sir.  Treasury Dept... I'd like to ask you a few questions.
We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station.  Have you made any purchases here today?
Then I'm afraid we'll have to impound your money until we're sure that it's all good.  Can I see your wallet and your ticket, please?
It isn't any better.
Meat loaf, apple pie and a cup of coffee.
What time you get off work here?
I don't even know you.
Les, I got Mr. Lonnegan with me. He wants to see you a second.
You sure you wanna start off that big?  Bet like that could put a real dent in us.
Aw, come on, Hooker, why don't you just...
Your boss is quite a card player, Carver.  How does he do it?
So could Shaw.
If you help me out, I'll pay ya back the money you owe Shaw, myself.
You should always look to the back too, kid.
And you were gonna pay me back?
'Cause it's better to do it all at once.  We're puttin' down 400 grand next week.  At 5-1 we make 2 million. Twenty per cent of that is yours if ya stick with us.
You got the 400 grand yet?
No.
A week's a long time, friend. Anything can happen.  All of it bad.
Tell your friend I'll have the money here by post-time tomorrow. We'll take the first race where the odds are 4-1 or better.  And make sure I can get to that window this time.
Look, I got nothin' against you, but you're in trouble here.  All you gotta do is tell us when Gondorff's gonna play his chump. We come in at the sting, make the pinch, and you walk out free as a bird.  No questions, no court appearance, nothing.
On a 6-1 shot?  The hell with ya. We'll keep the deal we got.
This is the last time I expect to see you down here.
There's a physiological as well as a psychological angle in my father's relationship with Julia Wolf that the police have overlooked.  And I think it explains everything.  You see, my father was a sexogenarian.
Why not?
What could happen to him, darling? You mustn't worry....  What is it?
Any luck?
Well!
Oh, Andy.
I can't marry you!  I can't ever marry you!
Then what are you hiding?
Oh!
Not that scrawny little....? 
How did you ever remember me?
Your father?
Hello, Dorothy. 
It's been the same one for three months.
He'll still be your son-in-law!
Wait a minute.  When is it going to be? I'm leaving town tonight.
Like all the rest of us.  Has this fellow...  ...has he seen the whole family?
Poor Dad, does that still bother you?
Goodbye, darling.  Don't you dare forget...  December 30th.
What is it, Gilbert? Tell mother! What did he say?
Did you kill her?
Well, I've got my alibi.  I was at the Public Library.  Where were you?
How'd you people happen to pop in?
Ask him.  I don't know.
Man to man, Mr. Charles, are you working on this case?
What about the suicide?
Get anything?
I guess that cinches it, eh, Mr. Charles?  He killed them both - Julia Wolf and Nunheim.
I said he hadn't written me.
He telephoned me today.
I didn't know they had a fight.
That's all right.  Well, we'll be going.
What kind of clothes was he wearing?
That's ridiculous.
Good morning --
Do you think that Wynant did it?
What are you going to do?
Why, you said...
We're just having a little drink.
Did you get my money?
One hundred...  two hundred... three...
I wish you'd count them.  There's a thousand dollars there.
Well, let me do that for you.
Nothing, thank you.  Nothing.  I wanted to see you...  What's Mimi up to, Charles?
She usually is.  Trying one way or another to get money out of Wynant. I wanted to find out if you were er - er -  --sleuthing for her.
You don't say --
I see.  I see.
My wife.
How are you?
What are the chances of getting you to do what he wants?
But it must have been Wynant.  I should have known if it weren't his voice.
Dorothy!  Is she here?
This is all very pleasant but why are here?
It isn't a story - it's true.  I did see Wynant.  He's not dead.
You might have mentioned me first.
By the way, how is your father's side?
What hit me?
She didn't tell me a thing.
Nick!  Nick!  Are you asleep?
Good. I want to talk to you.
Everybody says you were a grand detective.
I think I would like that drink.  I'll give you your Christmas present now if you'll give me mine.
There's one coming.
Sure -- I don't even feel it.
On it!  I'm in it ... They think I did it!
I wish they'd stop that.  It makes me fidgety. Do you think they'll find him, Nick?  He must be in New York....  Where do you think you're going?
He's just been for a walk.
What's that?  What are you up to?  Nickie - what is this?
What are you going to do?
Why shouldn't be close it? He went away.
Go on - go on - see if I care. But it's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to New York just to make me a widow.
You dog!
I want you to stay and find Wynant.
But they all said it was Rosebreen's.
What makes you so sure it's Wynant's body?
How long has he been dead?
I'm going to tell her.
Yes!
The suspects!  They won't come.
Mimi!
You're going to drive me crazy!
If that knife is missing, I'll look for it in your back.
You can save that and tell it to the police.  They'll be here in a minute.
That's what Mr. Wynant said to me. If she re-married, all the money was to go to the children.
Nick Charles here?
Maybe Miss Wolf has them.
I'm sorry...  but...
Who fired you?
You speak English?  DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH!?
Paper.
It's a map, I think that's what it is.
Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
What if it's a Valloro 69?  Just going to bounce right up out of the ground, explode in the air, kill him and us.
I don't want to see people killed any more than you.  But we try to help out we die, and all we do is die.
Not much of a pass.
The US Army:  Always an adventure.
All right.  Let's break out some utility shovels, lanterns, and a claymore in case we have to do any blasting.  Me and Jaeger'll climb down, and see what we can see.
It'll be too dark to make our way back now.  Let's bed down for the night and head out at first light.
We can't just leave him.  He'll run back to his outfit, report our position...
You're out of your mind.
I'm not going to leave him be just so he can stab us in the backs the minute we turn around.  I have been through too much to lose it all now just because the two of you don't have the stomach to do what has to be done.
We been down this road.  I told you how it is.  Unless you feel like there's something you want to do about it...
No navicom.  A lot of good you are now, Epps.
Without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge.
Then I suppose it'd be insurrection, and I suppose I'd have to kill you.  I suppose.
Looks like at the end of the day we finally find out who's better than who, don't we, Epps?  Like I said; I expected more from you.
Don't worry about Jaeger.  He uses his personality as a form of birth control.
What!?  What!?
It's war.  People get lost all the time in war, cut off--
Third.  What you're going to do with your third.
Invest it.
Shut up!  Both of you shut the hell up!
They'll shoot us!
They're not going to--
Figure they don't want to mess with us anymore than we want to mess with them.
Look at it.  LOOK AT IT!  Shot to hell. It's been leaking gas since the fire fight.  I told you to check for damage.
Hey...hey!  Slow up.  You don't have to go so fast.
Why you got to move away to talk!?
You're moving away because it's going to blow up, isn't it!?  It's going to blow up!
I said nobody dies.  Nobody dies.
How's this going to work?
You're going to blow yourselves up.
I didn't have to stop anything, 'cause nobody was going to do nothing.  We're in this together, understand?
Don't!
Not enough.  We're out numbered and out gunned.  They'd cut us to shreds.
What are we going to do?  What the hell are we going to do?
Think there might be more Iraqis?
What are you doing?
Must be a compartment.
Maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore.
He's not going to leave us.
Why do I have to stay down here?
I don't see how that plan's any better.
There's another pass on the photo.  We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down.
What are we going to do?  How are we going to find our way back!?
We can't just leave him.
No.
I'm glad I didn't have to kill you.  I'm glad it didn't come to that.
We can't just sit here.  We've got to start moving, so pick.
Getting cold.
Epps...Epps!  I'm gonna stop for a second.
I just want to look at it.  Remind me of what I'm dying for.
Can't you--
Don't go bitch on me now!  You were going to kill me.  Kill them!
An Iraqi?
What do we do?
...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.
Which way do we go!?
It's always been like that.  When you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up I figured I'd better...take precautions.  I rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack.  Just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own.
I want you to know... I don't know.  I just think you're a hell of a guy.
This whole time, you've kept your head. You didn't go money simple like me and Wes.  You've just been trying to figure how to get us out of here.  And you've been fair too.  I mean, even after I...you know...
Yeah.  Even after that.  You didn't take it out on me, except for maybe making me lie in the middle of the road now.  But I'd say you've been very fair.  I just think it's a hell of a man who can keep from going money simple.
Epps?
I'm thinking about taking a trip.
Still am.  There's more gold than I thought, and since there's only two of us now...  Where should I go?
That shouldn't be too hard to read.  Iraq is the pink thing.
Planning on going to war all by your lonesome?
Yeah, a headache.  My head hurts.  You're making me uncomfortable.
And you're the guy who's going to open it.
You really think there's a treasure inside?
Jaeger?
That's in two days.
We're going to war, aren't we.  If they're doing all that it must mean we're going to war.
Jaeger?
At-at-at-at-at.
The longer the air force hits the Iraqis, the safer it'II be for us when we have to engage.
It's...it's...I don't know what it is.
Epps, you're smarter than this.  Jaeger I understand, but you're smarter.
God!  I don't believe I'm doing this.  I don't.
Hey, Wes, what kind of treasure you figure these people buried?
This is too much.  You don't even have the money and you're wasting it.
Iraqis.
Two vehicles.  They're not supposed to be here.
We're not stranded.  We've got enough gas in the other reserve to get us back.
Haven't found a mine for half a mile, or more.
Jesus!  What the hell did he do that for? They're Iraqis.  Why are Iraqis killing Iraqis?
Think we can make it?
Maybe they're as scared of us as we are of them.
So we'll take him with us.  At least 'til we get back to the Hummer.
Maybe we ought to...you know, bury him. Say some words over him.
Drug evasion with assorted perversions
A sinex drop reading of less then 2000 degrees with an accompanying loss of greater then 350 degrees since admission may indicate....?
Hurry up.
No, your going to eat it, or it will go to waste.
What did you get?
When?
I haven't done anything.
I said what time is it?  How long was I out?
What are you doing here?  Is anything wrong?
What do you think you're doing? You're going to get us arrested.
What are you doing?
If you....if you go back on sedation, you won't feel the same way about me.  You'll report me for drug evasion.
no...no, no.
It's the end.
Who?  Who's leaving?
I can just barely see him.  I think he's leaving.
We must escape.  We have plans. We can leave.  We must wait until...
Where's LUH?
I'll report you.  It's....
I'm leaving.
I'm leaving.
Which way?
We've lost SEN!
Who?  Me?...I don't know.
Yes.
And you are...?
Just do it.
Where did you get this?
High-grade det cord. This girl, either she's got strange taste in jewelry or she's into serious demolition.
Alright, let's check it out.
What was-? Why...?
By the way, I'm Glass. This is T.J., and Pooch.
Treat. We treat devices.
Nice performance back there. Where'd you learn that, Mike Ditka Sensitivity Seminar?
This is where the van was parked.
Then, it's gotta be here somewhere ...
Nitro-cellulose. What is that, some kind of explosive?
Not bad for Bomb squad, eh?
You guys seem pretty tight.
I know. I was working a drug ring, deep cover. Played the part too well. When they pulled me out, I wasn't a cop anymore. My fiance had dumped me. Next thing I knew, I was out here on the street, doped up, auditioning for the morgue when this tough old vice cop found me, cleaned me up, gave me a second chance. He promised Captain Winters he'd look out for me.
Ex-girlfriend?
C'mon, talk to me! We can do it!
Keep talking.
Wires... metal, cold... something soft...
More metal... sharp edge...
Which one's which?
Whadaya mean?
Hey, matches are a very big thing in our line of work.
What do ay say?
There is a motel downtown, near the Machine Shop... the Suncrest. Room 138.
You okay?
Why are we stopping here?
Alex, please-
Drop it.
I want to work this.
You touch me again and--
What the hell's going on?
Mike. No thanks, I'm fine.
Oh shit...
Know what the problem is, kid? You're too ugly to get propositioned.
We're vice, I didn't see no pimps or hookers in that van. But if you're so gung-ho, we'd best call it in for some back-up.
You okay?
P.E.T.N ...
It's our only option.
Reilly, what the hell are you-?
Eleven o'clock! 
The representative of the police wants to know if there is anything wrong with your tonsils.
Yes, M'sieu Filiba?
I wanted to say goodbye to you.
No.
Yes!
Good morning, Major.
You're looking fine, Major.
No color, no sparkle--but dependable.
Yes, sir?  What shall we start with, Baron?
I would start with cocktails.
And as for you, waiter--
I hope you find the figures correct.
It may be important to you, M'sieu Giron--
Monescu.
You see, the bag has just been found, and the reaction of relief from her former excitement and strain is just a little too much for her. It's not very serious, but just the same we'd better not take any chances.
No, no, no! I disagree with you absolutely. That's the trouble with you artillery men.
Do you <u>know</u> King Boris?
That's hotel life. In one room a man loses his wallet  and in another room a man loses-- his head. 
Please.
I like you, Baron.
Monescu!
I always liked him. Especially last year in Munich ...
We'll go to Venice, to the same hotel!
Filiba ...
No--not yet--but--  Two tickets to Berlin--first class and sleeper--night train ... Right ... Right ... Leave them in the name of--Don Ignacio Fernandez ... Right ... Thank you. 
Correct. Now the train leaves--
I don't know. Fortunately, she has a dinner engagement tonight. I'll meet you at the station--midnight.  Hello ... Yes? What? ... You found a handbag? Well, you're three weeks too late! 
By the way, how is your German?
<u>Also</u>, <u>um</u> <u>zwoelf</u> <u>Uhr</u>.
Now, Lily--
And you--
Then you go to the left. There's a landing.
Then you go into the foyer.
And in that niche, there is a statue of Venus.
You like that statue?
Please, Madame Colet, I believe in doing things correctly. Shall we continue?  Two hairpins, one cigarette lighter, one box of real matches, and-- Oh, yes, this letter from Major--
Everything! ... Madame Colet, if I were your father--  which, fortunately, I am not--
Crimson!
Good night. 
No--yours, madame.
Like that!
Then why do you want to go?
Mariette!
Adolph J. Giron.
It could have been marvelous ...
Oh, no, it's the way you lead.
No, m'sieu!
You've had your breakfast--oh, but of course you have.
Oh, no, no, no, no, my dear child! That's ridiculous. You go home as usual--five o'clock every day. Now I'm going to be a little bit of a tyrant--I insist. It'll be nice for your little brother, too. <u>Five</u> <u>o'clock</u>--remember!
I think you'd better go.
I beg your pardon!
Five compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to the next... back and back. There's no stopping it.
Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly.
Please tell only who you must, I don't want to be responsible for a panic. And get to a boat quickly. Don't wait. You remember what I told you about the boats?
Mr. Andrews, thank God! Where would the Master at Arms take someone under arrest?!
No! I'll do this with or without your help, sir. But without will take longer.
Bottom, left, right. I have it.
Who's the best? Say it.
We've put together the world's largest database on the Titanic. Okay, here...
The partners want to know how it's going?
What could possible be funny?
Those mud puddles were certainly a waste of money.
Is that the going rate for saving the woman you love?
My God... Cal. Is it a --
Yes. Your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting.
You will never behave like that again! Do you understand?
Where are you going? To him? Is that it? To be a whore to that gutter rat?
Is this in any way unclear?
I know.  Perhaps you could join us for dinner tomorrow, to regale our group with your heroic tale?
'Cause you're goin' to America!! Full house boys!
Keep pulling... away from the ship. Pull.
Captain, the press knows the size of Titanic, let them marvel at her speed too. We must give them something new to print. And the maiden voyage of Titanic must make headlines!
Ever been to Wisconsin?
Sorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went through some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain.  Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like I said, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here.
Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you.
I don't... it wasn't just one thing. It was everything. It was them, it was their whole world. And I was trapped in it, like an insect in amber.  I just had to get away... just run and run and run... and then I was at the back rail and there was no more ship... even the Titanic wasn't big enough. Not enough to get away from them. And before I'd really though about it, I was over the rail. I was so furious. I'll show them. They'll be sorry!
Oh no! Oh, I'm so sorry. Truly!
You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people.
I saw that in a nickelodeon once, and I always wanted to do it.
You're not one of them. There's been a mistake.
Where to, Miss?
Looks okay. I don't see anything.
Now it's worse.
Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't!
So... how did you find out I didn't do it?
No... don't say your good-byes, Rose. Don't you give up. Don't do it.
You must do me this honor... promise me you will survive... that you will never give up... no matter what happens... no matter how hopeless... promise me now, and never let go of that promise.
Never let go.
It's make the bergs harder to see, with no breaking water at the base.
Rose, this is not a game! Our situation is precarious. You know the money's gone!
Don't look so uncomfortable, Lee--it interferes with your good looks. Give me a cigarette.  What did you do--persuade her to come on this voyage with you?
Did you muss up her hair by accident, too?
Feeling a little better, I see.
No--I'm furious!--Nobody seems to do anything about it--
Could I see you a minute?
In that case--you owe us exactly sixteen hundred dollars.
I'm so sorry!
I thought you were one of my friends.
Don't thank me. Do you recognize me without the lipstick?
Tell me.
I'm sorry I'm late, but something happened.
Thanks.
Would you like to take a turn around the deck with me?
You're a little ahead of yourself--the usual routine would be for you to propose, and if I accept, then you'd give me an engagement ring--
Good night, Mrs. Brett!
How well do you know her?
I'll change and be with you in ten minutes.
I'm going to return the bracelet right now and face the consequences.
Oh, I'm not squawkin', but I'm not used to working and it's a bad habit to get into.
Nix, the law!
You don't think--?
Not a chance.
Maybe she's in the show--One of the troupers--did you ever think of that?
Shortie!--you know my motto?
Inspector McKinney.
I fell in his arms--Couldn't resist it.
Say--wait a minute!
Come in! 
Three Jacks.
That goes two ways.
Well, someone else besides myself may have seen you in the vicinity of Mrs. Rosson's cabin this evening--even the stewards in that corridor insisted on being searched. Get me?
This has nothing to do with me--  But always remember, Purser, when you're searching anybody, take the lining of their coat, like this--  --run your fingers all along these seams.... Then-- back of the collar--<U>here</U>--that used to be a favorite trick--and never forget to put your finger down inside of the shoe--like this.
Wouldn't bet against her.  Tell you what I will do--bet you I find that bracelet before we hit France.  Not a hundred, though--just fifty.
Thought you might need me--don't talk, kid, and don't let him scare you-- 
Their faces are familiar--but not to each other.
That's all right. I'll attend to this.
She was to meet me here--why don't you wait? She ought to be here any minute.
Yes--but don't ask me why--because I could never tell you. I don't know what most guys want out of life--but <U>that</U> would be enough for me--I wouldn't care about-- easy money--or--showing off my smart brains--I'd just like to live <U>my</U> life so nothing I did would bounce back and ruin <U>hers</U>--Do I make myself clear?
Just a minute--I don't think we need the word "Back" --Where <U>is</U> "Back"?
That's great! There's the address and message all in one word.
Well, there's no use in sending it.  See that--I saved you seven twenty!
What?
That's me!
I can see where I won't talk much to you.
Hello, Denby!
Not now, Toots--Which is the right way to say this? You're dumber than me--or--you're dumber than I?
McKinney's the name.
Here we are, folks--eighty thousand wild-eyed fans go mad--they go mad as Chad Denby--with the arms of iron, and the nerves of steel--picks up his racket--  What is this thing--a racket or a mallet?
Are you paying any attention to his jokes?--the first thing you know, you'll be taking piano lessons from Venus de Milo--  Get out of here. 
Looks like your old workshop back on 42nd Street.
I came to tell you what a swell guy I think you are to do this--
Well, let's hear the poem--
Oh, Mr. Den-n-by!
Well, he has a straw hat--
Never mind the Who's Who--Before I get on this boat I want to know What's What! How about my raise? All I get out of these ocean trips is dizzy.
Oh, Chad--what about the rest of the show?
What for?
You're wasting your time--she's a friend of mine.
That's him! That's the sucker!!
I went for four.
All right--but what is there to face? It's finished.
I wish I could.
Don't, Lee--that's dead.
I wouldn't say that--  I'm glad he's dead--yes--I'd thought of killing him-- but I didn't--
It's getting kind of chilly on deck. If you'll excuse me, I think I'll go to bed. Good night, Mr. McKinney!
I mean if you knew it were stolen.
That's the truth--every single word!
Next time I get a vacation I'll spend it at headquarters. Good-night.
Well, I'll be a son of a sea cook!
I'm all right.
I was in his cabin--
Everything in order, sir?  What are <U>you</U> doing here, my lad?
Where'd you get that horse?
What'd the Messican mean, a sick Horse's gonna get us?  Didn't make No sense.
I'm retired.
Come on, you...
Feel bad about ol' Fred.  Just Can't hold back when I'm feelin' Woolly.  Still, feel kinda bad. But now we're square.  Anyway no Use for holdin' a grudge.  I Deserved a rap in the head.
I want you to know it's over. We're leaving and we're not Coming back.
Look at that!  Yeah!  Come and get Some, boy!
No Marshal, you don't understand. I'm through with lawing, I'm Through with the whole Proposition.  Forever.  I did my Duty, now I'd like to get on with My life.  That is if you don't Mind.  Jesus.  Good day now.
Age quod agis.
Ecentus stultorum magister.
I calculate that's the end of This town.  And let's don't bother About the luggage, darling.

No, no, get away, get away from me...
I have to go.
What can I get you?
You see that bird at the faro Table?  That's Johnny Tyler.  He Barged in here one day, said he Was takin' over the game, started Slappin' customer, wavin' his Gun around, scarin' off all the High-class play.  Only trade comes In here now's just bummers and Drovers, just the dregs.
Really?  You sure?
Mattie.  What about this?
So what about you Cowboys anyway?
I know that cut.  You mean there's A waterhole near there?
Next waterhole's Black Draw.  We Could be there by mid-morning.
There they are.  No herd though.
Hey Doc!  Come on now.

That thunder's sure somethin'.

That a fact?
Go ahead.  Skin it.  Skin that Smoke wagon and see what happens.
Easy, gents. Private affair...  Wyatt! Doc! Hey!
Talked it over.  We decided we Don't need the money.  Took out 13 Dollars each, though.  Federal Posseman's fee.  That all right?
Pretty fun too, isn't it?
It's got nothin' to do with you, Wyatt.  It's-
Virge, you're makin' the arrest. You make contact, I'll back you Up.  Morgan'll back me up, Doc'll Keep an eye out for trouble.  And Keep your hands on your guns. They even look like they're gonna Start something, buffalo 'em. Right over the head.
Getting late.  Guess I'll turn in.
See what I mean about it getting Spooky?
Ike Clanton, Old Man's eldest Son.  Know he ain't got the stuff, Makes him miserable.
But -
It's too late -
Before I became involved with Paris, she was always involved with the most inappropriate' men...  Playboys. Thrill seekers. Middle aged Peter Pans who only brought out the worst in her.
...And what's that, my dear?
In the Strait of Malacca, when a boat is even five minutes late, one begins to worry, Mr. Bond.
Maybe you should talk to Sidney Winch. Owns a marine salvage company. Nobody knows more about the Strait.
Tsi tien, Chien-penny.
By the way, James: Ordinarily I would never ask, but... Weren't you and that Colonel once stranded on a raft for two weeks in the Sargasso Sea?
What - no lust for adventure?
Do I have to dial '9' to get out?
I must say, Q, you seem to be doing rather well in your retirement.
Yes -
What about the uranium?
I'm so sorry, James. I promise, I'll never leave you again.
It must do something.
I don't know if you'd call it a boat...
I think I've just seen my next future ex-wife.
I have to get these to London. Do you know this Captain Cheong?
I got you covered.
Sidney Winch, meet -
Have we met?
Boyfriend?
Actually, I'm here on business. You might say it was a... Golden opportunity.
Insurance. Lloyds of London.
Why don't we just take these -
... Do you have a gun?
You heard me. A gun?  I left mine in the car.
Blood or Dutch?
This has got to be a mistake.
Put your back to the railing. Sit up on it.
Sometimes you just have to -
Here. You shoot. I'll drive.
Another reason??? Did I miss something???
If it's radio controlled, it'll break the code.
Come in, 007. You know the Minister?
- Along with Tomorrow - the first world-wide newspaper. Circulation 27 million. Daily. -
Which is also why I've withheld this information from NATO and our allies.
.... I hate to ask, but... Did you ever think you'd miss Communism?
But if Elliot Harmsway is involved with that uranium, I want him prosecuted to the ends of the earth.
...I'll give you a ring from Venice.
Sorry I'm late -
What do you make of all this?
Sakwa!
Who's in charge here?
...Well! I do believe this requires further investigation!
- Built to withstand a nuclear blast.  Are they alive?
I regret to inform you, sir, that Saddam Hussein is still demanding a bonus for his role in the Gulf War.
... And there's no truth that 10% of that money will go into your Swiss bank account?
Please sir. Please -
Oh, no.
Kim Dae Yung. North Korean Nuclear specialist.
Why, you don't want us to bring him over?
You want me to mortgage my house to invest in a scheme of yours? You know the last time we went into something together Daddy had to go in his savings to keep us from ending on the street.
Robert asks about you. When are you going to do something to help him?
Who is it?
I was hoping you came to the door instead of him. It gets cold at night.
What is that?
Never play with someone's else's cards. You always get a new deck. Look at this card. See anything?
Son, would you do me a favor and see if you could turn off that tap in the bathroom. My hand is too weak. And would you do me another favor? I don't like asking this but would you clean the tub for me? I have trouble bending over.
Not anymore, not in the city.
I asked you to wake me when Babe Brother comes.
I'm not going to let him get away with murder.
I'm trying to make him a man but you keep babying him.
Since this morning.
He's going to check out heaven first. He gets a round trip ticket to heaven. He gets in heaven and finds it just like back home. People dripping with sweat, working in the fields, hardly surviving. He asked a man who was getting a drink of water, "I thought the streets were paved with gold." "They are but you won't see them," he said. "Boy, you got to work day and night cause idleness is sinfulness." So he takes the other half of his ticket and takes the express to hell. He sees people stretched out on their backs kicking back, picking their teeth. "Man, this is a dream." He asked, "What's you'll doing?" They all hollered back, "Sinning." The devil was shaking hands with everyone and came up to him and said, "Please to meet you." He asked, "I thought you'll was supposed to be burning in fire." Someone said, "Man, ain't no fire down here except under that pot of chitlins." The man was going go ask the preacher back on earth...
I'm almost finished. I'm about to come to the punch line.
But these are white people, anybody. The punch...
I came all the way from Detroit by bus going to Oakland. The bus stopped in Los Angeles. I had to get off and take a rest. I'll catch the last bus leaving at midnight. I'm just too tired to go on.
My feet have never been on anything that wasn't directly attached to the ground.
One can tell you are from back home. These people nowadays don't know what manners are.
I have someone I want you to meet.
How is everybody?
Can you watch Gideon for a while? One of the girls is going into labor. Junior is going to drive me over.
Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one...
Those boys never did have good luck.
I was quoting from the Bible. If the shoe fits, wear it.
I asked Harry about it. He didn't own up to it. He said he didn't know what got into Okra.
We can't really bring another family in here with us.
When did you talk to Harry?
He just leeches off your parents. He is a master at wearing out welcome.
Now you don't have to say anything if you don't want to.
I'm sorry he got those birds.
How are you?
I didn't mean for you to pay me for that.
Wow!  Cool!
Well, honey, just grab some other toy!  Now c'mon!
Right here in the van.
Everybody say, "Bye, house."
You'd think they've never seen a new toy before.
Uh, let what?  I don't -- Uh, what do you mean?  Who?
Say, isn't that mistletoe?
Can!
Don't even think about it, cowboy!
Oh, no, no, no...  Buzz, look!  An alien!
THAT is Sid!
Down there.  Just down there.  A helpless toy...it's...it's trapped, Buzz!
Ow!  Watch where you're going!
What's gotten into you, Sheriff?  I was --
I've set my laser from stun to kill.
They're gonna eat us, Buzz!!  Do something!  Quick!
It's not working.  I recharged it before I left.  It should be good for hours --
Oh, come on, Buzz.  I...Buzz, I can't do this without you.  I need your help.
No, it is.  Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's because you're a TOY!  You are HIS toy.
Buzz!!  What are you doing?  I thought you were --
It doesn't matter how much we're played with.  What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us.  That's what we're made for. Right? Everyone is now looking down, sheepish.
Hi!
Oh, boy.  Will ya take a look at all those presents?!
Ohhh!  You sunk it!
Son of a building block, it's Woody!
What?
I don't know!
Where's my ear?  Who's seen my ear? Did you see my ear?
Well, that MISTAKE is sitting in your spot, Woody.
I'm sorry.  It's just that I get so nervous before I travel.
A lunchbox?!
Good going, Slink!  Now, just, just tie it on to something!
You are a liar!
No wait!  You don't understand! Buzz is out there!  We've gotta help him!!
Shouldn't they be there by now? What's taking them so long?!
Ha ha.  That's very funny, Buzz.  This is serious!!
Okay, we're on the last present now...
Yessss!  Ah, ha, ha, ha...
Not now, Mom, I'm BUSY!
W-w-w-we?
Bad news?!
Heh, heh, heh!  Golly bob howdy --
I can't hold on much longer!
He's a pyjama case, really.
What was <i>that</i> in aid of?
He'll murder you when he finds out.
I thought she was fondest of you, because you were the youngest.
Surely she is older?
Everything is gone, now.
They're going to fly everywhere. Mean things. They should have taken us.
I'm not too young. Juliet was my age.
He's not here.
Helena, I'm so sorry --
This place is swept twice a day.  I learned that in Miami in '85.  Then the U.S. shut down the whole Caribbean, but it's a big game of wack-a-mole.  Knock it down in Miami, it pops up here.  And San Diego is so much more relaxing.
Yes, I told you before, there are people who owe you money but they're not paying.  There's too much heat on Carl.
Helena --
It's Saturday, Arnie.  You work too hard.
Don't bother.
We'll ground her, clip her wings a bit.  School and scheduled activities and that's it until further notice. This has to be handled delicately. Dan Kelly, in the District Attorney's office, will probably help us out, quietly.  Christ, this could be embarrassing.
This is different.
Explain to me how you could think that I shouldn't know about this. Explain to me how this wouldn't be relevant to me.  As a parent.
Because I'm at the edge of my capabilities, Robert.
I'm not the one who has to have three scotches just to walk in the door and say hello.
As it happens, the President of the United States, my new boss, the leader of the free world, has me penciled in for some "face time".
Inhale the smoke and hold it.
Did Courtney Love play Nancy in Syd and Nancy?
No more pissant basin league bullshit for us, hunh?
Move 'em to Texas, fry 'em up.
What do you think it is?
What would a law firm want from the new drug Czar?
You were followed by the police, but they won't hear us over the children. I want to use a bomb.
Listen you motherfucker, you tried to kill me with a fucking cannon.
One chance here, Eduardo.  Make us believe you got a boss.  No boss, it's all on you.
Carlos, I mean Carl, started out in the family connection business: real estate in Tijuana, fishing boats out of Ensenada, hydroponic raspberries. He met up with the Obregon brothers of the Tijuana Cartel who were interested in two things: entering society and using his fishing boats.
Yes, he threatened to kill my five year-old son.  I was under the impression I would be meeting Juan Obregon.
We have the ability to change the color, odor, and physical property of cocaine.
That's good coke.
Take this back with you.  Deliver it safely to Tigrillo in San Diego and we have a deal.
Guzman, Tomas, Esteban --
So... maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations.
You should feel good about this.
I'm trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel.
Does this offer include my partner?
I hope when you were on the bench, Judge Wakefield, you didn't handle the presumption of innocence in the same fashion.
I want your money, I'll take your money.
What?
Let me ask you a related question. We've talked about the supply side, but what about demand?  What is your policy for treating addiction?
He's a research doctor.  You're dad's a doctor, too --
Well, why didn't you bring them?
For fuck's sake.
All down my fucking front, you fucking idiot.
It's a scandal, Franco.
What?
Yes, you fucking do. I've seen your statement.
We'll be half-way down the road with the money.
Cool down, Franco. The guy's sorry.
Where's that?
Jesus.
In that case you can do it. You were quite happy to do a lot more last night.
What do you want?
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
It's so simple. We buy it at four grand, we punt it at twenty to this guy that Sick Boy knows, and he punts it at sixty. Everyone's happy, everyone's in profit. I put up two. I come away with six.
Tommy, let's put the tape on.
I'm an old boy myself, you know?
No, actually I went to Craignewton but I was worried that you wouldn't have heard of it so I put the Royal Edinburgh College instead, because they're both schools, right, and we're all in this together, and I wanted to put across the general idea rather than the details, yeah? People get all hung up on details, but what's the point? Like which school? Does it matter? Why? When? Where? Or how many O grades did I get? Could be six, could be one, but that's not important. What's important is that I am, right? That I am.
You take the test?
It's certainly a phenomenon in all walks of life.
No, it's not bad, but it's not great either, is it? And in your heart you kind of know that although it sounds all right, it's actually just shite.
Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated.
You know.
God, you're sick.
I can't believe you did that.
Why would I want to sell my passport?
How much?
The Sick Boy method.
He's always been lacking in moral fibre.
No, thank you. I'll proceed directly to the intravenous injection of hard drugs, please.
If I'm giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket, I'm just saying it had better be good. There's plenty of other things I could be doing.
Homeless people?
He has his doubts...
Admit it. We're lost.
Shuttle en route.
But the shuttle-
You caught me on my way to the shower.
On "The Planet Of Galactic Peace?"
The Klingon, the Romulan, the Federation consuls. Now I know Enterprise is not exactly up to specs...
Other ships, yes. But no experienced commanders. Captain, I need Jim Kirk.
Where did you get this power?
Don't you worry, Captain. We'll beat those Klingon devils even if I have to get out and push.
Mr. Scott, get the transporter working. If we contact a rescue ship we'll need it.  Which way to the turbo shaft?
Captain, Starfleet transmission on line.
Standard orbit, Mr. Sulu.
Bird of Prey bearing one zero five mark two.
Spock - What are you doing in this neck of the woods?
And that is?
Oh, God
Oh, no. It isn't that. I knew I wouldn't die because the two of you were with me.
Come on, Spock. Why didn't you jump in?
Jim.
Life is not a dream.
Yes, Captain.
Spock, what is it? Do you know this Vulcan?
I do not often think of the past.
Be one with the horse.
Exactly 15.5 seconds.
What you have done is betray every man on this ship.
Forgive you? I ought to knock you on your goddamn ass!
There, you see? See?
Is it possible?
There Sha Ka Ree is fabled to exist.
New word. "b".. "a"... um...
There is an emergency sending apparatus in the forward observation room.
I believe I have found a faster way.
What is this?
No! No reply. Remain on course.
No... I didn't.
About the ship...



Easy, easy,  easy, Scotty. Easy. You're back with us.
Spock, you've developed a sense of humor after all.
Spock?
Sybok - this is not the God of Sha Ka Ree - or any other God!
Sybok.
You did break in.
Oh, I wish you'd forget about that. It was all so long ago. I've totally gotten over it.
I want to go to his place.
What for?
I don't think I'm cleared for this.
What do you mean, "'yes"?
I'm your program?
Yes!
No problem, Master-C. If you've seen one Consumer Electronics Show...  What's up?
Cute.
That MCP, you know, that's half the problem right --
What's that?
No big deal. I ought to know my way around that Light Cycles routine... I mean, I did write the program for it.
What about our friend - Sark?
Yori, steer us over the beam, right next to it.
Flynn... you can't... I
Yeah, yeah -- that's great.
What's goin' on?
Hey... !
Hey, you know anybody who wants to get hold of some video games... cheap?
Sure, I'd love to go up against some of these guys ... be a nice break from these accounting creampuffs you keep sending me. Which branch of the service?
A User?
Wait...I need that...
Yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.
You think we can make it there?
I can't believe how bad it's gotten around here since the MCP started taking over... all the good functions have shut down... everybody looks so dead... I'm afraid to even go out during down-time...
How?
Yes...it can take us across the Sea of Simulation... all the way out of the Game Grid...to the MCP.
Nice...
Are you kidding?  Harry had to go out of town.
You bitch.
Can you cover me for an hour?
You seem fine now.
Dana, are you listening to me?
You'd tell me if there was something wrong, wouldn't you, pumpkin?
How was school today?
So what makes you think that the slack I cut him in any way translates to you?!
Switching to sub-vocal.  Gib, you copy?
Harry?  HARRY?!
Thanks dear.
Son of a bitch!
Uh huh.  And her little hormones are going like a fire alarm.  I				* say even money that physicist on				* the bike is boinkin' her.						*
Okay.  Okay.  De-nail ain't just a river in Egypt.  She's probably stealing the money to pay for an abortion.
It doesn't mean anything.  She buys antiquities for Khaled.
What?  It's on the way.  She says she's got something for me.
Helen's going to be pissed.
What's the plan?
Look at the way the little punk is driving.  He's all over the place.  Look-- he hasn't signalled once.
Ha!  The little prick ditched you!  That is so goddamn funny.
Look, uh... I've got to talk to Helen about this thing with Dana. I'm just going to run in and see if she can get away for lunch.
He-- Helen.  Helen-- it's Helen. It's Helen, Gib.
Congratulations.  Welcome to the club.
Oh shit.  Harry... what're you doing?
--you tell the son of bitch this is  Bright Boy Alert.  Repeat, a Bright Boy Alert.  And I need a patch of the White House ASAP. That's right--
Any minute now.
Janice, how many years have you been buzzing us in?
And you still reach for your piece every time.
So your clients want something for the lobby of their new corporate headquarters?
You think I care about their					* cause?  Or yours?  Not at all.					* See, America is on top now .  .				* .  but so was Rome, once.  All					* civilizations crumble.  One nation succeeding over another. What does it mean in the long run?  The only important thing is to live well.  And...  living					* well takes money.							*
That's fabulous Harry.
What did you tell him?
I need you to talk to Dana.  The vice principle called and she cut class again this afternoon.
I'm sorry.  Thank you for the party.
...and I'm troubleshooting it with them over the phone... talking to a translator, right, who's getting half of it wrong... it was unbelievable...  really wild.
You weren't attracted to him at all?
This Simon.  Did you sleep with him?
Let me out of her!  Right now!
Oh, gee thanks.  Mmmm, let me see--
I can do it!
What were you doing there?
Is it working yet?
Are we going to die?
Do you still love me?
Sorry.  Trade secret.
Well, think of it as playing a role.  It's fantasy.  You have to work on their dreams.  Get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours.
What's going on, Harry?
Tell me what happened?
What is it you want me to do?
Helen, I want you to be my wife.
Helen, there's a double agent in my outfit... I don't know who. There's no one I can trust. Except you.  Can you get away? Just for two days.
How?
No time. Gotta go. Just tell him to read the letter, the letter explains all. Tell him I love him. And tell him, as of tomorrow, all his money problems are over.
Thanks a lot.
No. Not particularly.  How come?
I love to get pie after a movie.
Well, enough about the King. How about you?
C'mon. What're ya tryin' to be? The Phantom Lady?
Apparently, I was hit on the head with something really heavy, giving me a form of amnesia. When I came to, I didn't know who I was, where I was, or where I came from. Luckily, I had my driver's license or I wouldn't even know my name. I hoped it would tell me where I lived but it had a Tallahassee address on it, and I stopped somebody on the street and they told me I was in Detroit. So that was no help. But I did have some money on me, so I hopped in a cab until I saw somethin' that looked familiar. For some reason, and don't ask me why, that theater looked familiar. So I told him to stop and I got out.
Do you get paid a lot?
Uh-huh, I was tryin' to think of somethin' to say to you, then I thought, she doesn't want me bothering her.
I dunno. I guess I'm just stupid.
I love Janis.
Did you hurt yourself?  Whatd'ya do? Step on a thumbtack?
Hello, Mrs. Worley.
Top o' the morning, Mrs. Worley.
Is this a joke?
You did it, Quickdraw. I'm so proud of you. You were like a ninja. Did I do my part OK?
With a vengeance, I hated them.
Shit, any nigger say he don't eat pussy is lyin' his ass off.
Nigger, get real. You touch Jayne Kennedy she'll have you ass in Wayne County so fast -
Go on pussy-eaters... laugh. You look like you be eatin' pussy. You got pussy-eatin' mugs. Now if a nigger wants to get his dick sucked he's got to do a bunch of fucked-up shit.
What?
Yeah.
You'd really do that?
You don't think I'm kissin' his ass, do you?
Where the fuck is that bitch?
Who the fuck are you?
Clarence?
Well, there's a story behind all that. I'll tell you when I see you. By the way, I won't be alone. I'm bringing my wife with me.
What?
How much of that letter was on the up and up?
You're really in love, aren't you?
Do you have any idea how much fuckin' coke you got?
What's this acting class guy's name?
OK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff.
Two guys. Now you want me to help you with some big drug deal. Fuck, Clarence, you killed somebody and you're blowin' it off like it don't mean shit.
Clarence...
Well, if we're not gonna do it, let's just get in the car and get the fuck outta here.
Well, enough about the King, how 'bout you?
So you guys got five hundred thousand dollars worth of cola that you're unloading -
Duh. What else would I be talking about? Now stop askin' stupid doorknob questions. Well, a year and a half ago, this friend of mine got access to the evidence room for an hour. He snagged this coke. But, he's a good cop with a wife and a kid, so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he could trust.
We were in Four H together. We've known each other since childhood. So, I'm handling the sales part. He's my silent partner and he knows if I get fucked up, I won't drop dime on him. I didn't tell you nothin' and you didn't hear nothin'.
What?
No. No, you don't.
Get it straight, Lee isn't into taking risks. He deals with a couple of guys, and he's been dealing with them for years. They're reliable. They're dependable. And, they're safe.
Well, I guess it's about that time.
Apparently I'm not as dumb as you thought I am.
Yeah, I subscribe. It's a pretty decent one.
I'm really not very -
Daddy. Nice isn't the word. Nice is an insult. She's a peach. That's the only word for it, she's a peach. She even tastes like a peach. You can tell I'm in love with her. You can tell by my face, can't ya? It's a dead giveaway. It's written all over it. Ya know what? She loves me back. Take a seat, Pop, we gotta talk -
What do you want from me?
Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me? You need money?
Yes, I still have friends on the force.
Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.
Yeah. Drexl had an association with a fella named Blue Lou Boyle. Name mean anything to you?
If you don't hang around in this circle, no reason it should.
Gangster. Drug Dealer. Somebody you don't want on your ass. Look, Clarence, the more I hear about this Drexl fucker, the more I think you did the right thing. That guy wasn't just some wild flake.
I don't know him. Is he a nice guy? You think he'll help me out?
You and Robin moved?
Do you believe him?
Nicholson and I.
Suspect's words -
They won't search you. I promise. You haven't done anything.
Do you live here?
How do you know? You been there?
Yes.
Excuse me, Mr. Coccotti.  Do you know Nick Cardella?
We want tough minded people.  Strong mentally.  We've had some...misfortunes with "unstable" types.
But just until you recover your, uh,... equilibrium.
It's the kidnap woman -- the one who was with the guy who tied us up.
Let's consider again our current information -- if the symptoms were first detected in Philadelphia on June 28, 1995, that makes us know that...?
I'm going to be completely honest.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I can't make the police let you go...but I do want to help you.  And I want you to trust me.  Can you do that, James?  May I call you "James"?
Why not?  Most people have some ID.
Yes, I remember.  Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?
Did something terrible happen to you when you were a child?  Something so bad...?
You didn't have a gun before, did you?
The guy was a total fruitcake.
We need gas.
You were going to run out off gas on purpose, weren't you?
I need help all right.  They're coming after me.
James!  That's a policeman.  Pretend you don't know me.  If he sees you...
Okay...you were standing there looking at the moon...you were eating grass... then what?
I want to be here.  In this time.  With you.  I want to become...become a whole person.  I want this to be the present. I want the future to be unknown.
I have seen it, but I don't remember this part.  Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past.  The movie never changes -- it can't change -- but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different -- you notice different things.
Why are we doing this?
You were in my dream just now.  I didn't recognize you.
That's what they were up to!  Freeing animals!
They may be looking for us, James.  Use this.  You can fix it in the Men's Room.
Who would you call, Mr. Cole, who would straighten everything out?
Germs?!
"What about the germs?"  I say.  He goes, "I don't believe in germs.  Germs are just a plot they made up so they can sell you disinfectants and soap!" Now, he's crazy, right?  Hey, you believe in germs, don't you?
What're you writing?  You a reporter?
Never saw him before in my life.  Go ahead and shoot him or torture him or whatever it is you do.
Excuse me -- what did you say?
We need to talk.  Come on.  Upstairs.  I am a new person!  I'm completely adjusted.  Witness the tux.  It's Armani.  Who chattered?  Goines?  Weller?
It's about obeying, about doing what you're told.
But you know what's real now?
Don't be defensive, Kathryn, this isn't an inquisition.
Two policemen were already in the hospital and now we have an orderly with a broken arm and a Security Officer with a fractured skull.
Kathryn, you know he can't possibly know that.  You're a rational person. You're a trained psychiatrist.  You know the difference between what's real and what's not.
One dozen bolt cutters!  Whadda you gonna do with one dozen bolt cutters?
That would explain the bruises, I guess.  The struggle.
Hey!  You there!
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
Don't forget to open it for me.  I can't be opening my own bottle.
Maybe I do.
Maybe one day I'll get to sit on a corner and spout wise.
We're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
Hundred and eight ain't a hundred and thirteen.
You ain't nothing but an old fool.
And what are you?  A rocket scientist?
Where to?
I bought a beer.  That was two- fifty.  I bought a beer, otherwise I would have thirty.
You want somethin'?
Will he be back soon?
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
Now that's too bad.  I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.
Goddamn you!  You son of a bitch!
We're closed.  Come back in the morning.
Now that you're so well off, can I get you something, Hon?
What would a truck stop be without beer?
No, we ain't got no Kirin.  We got Miller.
No.  We got Miller.  Regular Miller. You want it, or don't you?
Shasta!  Now why'd you go and scare the nice man like that?  Sorry about that, hon.  Enjoy your beer, and try to have a nice day.
Who was that on the phone?
What the hell you looking at, girl?
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
Jesus.
I got it.
Drove into Sierra?  What for?
You've been around.
Where you headed?
I didn't say it bothered me.
Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.
What do you do anyway?
No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do?
You love him?
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't.  I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
Take me with you.
Shit!
You got a suitcase?
To get my car.
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep in the garage.  Figure that way people will think maybe me and Jake went away.  Might buy us some time.
Sheriff Potter, please.  I can't go to jail.  I wanted no part of it.
What?
Well, nothing.
It's . . . it's locked.
Throw me the keys and I'll pull you up.
I guess we've never been introduced proper.  Jake McKenna.
What brings you to Sierra?
I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.
Hungry?
I'm surprised to see you.  I thought you'd be halfway to Vegas by now.
Nice office you've got.
Talk?  About what?
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
Don't play simple with me, Jake. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.
You're the one who brought it up. This morning.  In your car.
You know so much about killing why don't you do it yourself?
Shut up.
You could say.  I don't even have it yet.
Wait a minute.  Just listen to me--
It's the truth, Jake.
Is that what happened?  Did you even make it out to the desert, or did you just ply the afternoon between my sheets?
A drifter, a loner, a trouble maker like you?  Just passing through town, need money so he busts in on an, old man.  Only this old man's got himself an automatic, and he knows how to use it.  A man's got to protect his home.  His wife.  You're dead, boy, and your own mother wouldn't convict me.
Not from where I stand.
You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her.  How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.
But you was going to fight for me.
I wasn't doing anything.
Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.
Fine.  I was making time with your girl.  Now I'm all scared, and I'll never make that mistake again.  Now go away.
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm beating you up.
Now, what's this?
Mexico?  You're going to Mexico?
Nooo!
The old lady?
You're the gambler.  You tell me.
Do you understand me you little fuck?
Saw you at the truck stop this morning.  You're not from around here.
Suppose you've had all you can of Sierra.  What with that ruckus you had with Toby.  Oh yes, I heard all about that.
Just cool down, son.  I ain't accusing you of anything.  Serves Toby right to get his ass whooped. If you hadn't done it, somebody else would've.
I think you might just want to do as I say.
Hey!  You there!
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
Lost my eyes in Vyee-et-nam.  Lost them fighting the commies.  Fought the war and lost my eyes fightin' the commies just so you can come around here and make fun of me.
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark. All cause of a woman who made me this way. People are afraid of what they can't see. I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me.  Kiss from a beautiful woman, kissy kissy kiss, a lick from a dog, slurp, slurp, the kiss of death . It's all the same to me.
Time's up. Any last words of wisdom?
Let's see...they're not very imaginative?
Christ, I don't believe this!
Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then ... and then bust those pieces up, and then ... and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.
Now, what's this?
I'm a solid man.
She does at that.  I knew when I married her she was a free spirit.  A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect?  But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her.  What are you to do, eh? Women.
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
Well, I guess I have what you call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
If you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife ...? The thing is it's got to look like an accident; that's the thing. If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
Come to think of it, how 'bout some money upfront?
...I don't know.  Tell her you had to see her.  Tell her you don't care if she's married or not, you had to be with her. Sweet talk the woman.  A young buck like you must be good at that.  Then ... maybe shift the conversation.  Get her thinking about that jeep of hers.  She loves that thing.  Maybe the only thing she does love. She'll want to take you for a ride.
I guess this is what they call "ironee"? Hunh?
Shhh! Liar.
That's a thick change of heart from this afternoon.
Two-hundred dollars?
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that movie.
For defending my honor this afternoon.
You Harlin?
Harlin around?
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
"That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang."
Then you're only a hundred-forty-five in the hole.  You can keep that dollar. Now why don't you just take your American Express Gold Card, and call that guy with the big schnooz on TV and have him send you the money lickity split.
One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket.  That's going to run you another fifty.
Yeah, but it was shot.
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
What the fuck did you do to my trunk?
And you had to go into the trunk, didn't you?
Got any cold soda?
Soda.  You got any soda?
I don't know your real name.
I like that about me, beautiful.
Accident.
Wasn't nothing.
You're not from around here, are you?
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
You're lucky you didn't break down in the desert.  Day like today, you'd be dead in no time. When you leaving?
Nice place.
Where'd you learn to do that?
A medicine man?
My face tell you all that?
I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
You'd never understand.
Yeah. What do you want. Life, right?  Have you ever been to California?
Jake never gives me more'n twenty bucks at a time, like a bird in a cage, he don't want me goin' anywhere...
In <u>cash</u>?
It takes a key.  He keeps it on himself all the time.  I mean <u>all the time</u>.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
I wanted to talk.
Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace. 
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
I want a place where only the vultures will find him... It'll be over soon, Grace.
We're going to buy a boat of our own baby, and sail it wherever we want to go.
The only deal he had in mind was killing you for Jake's murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest of my life... no thanks.
When you're finished with me, I'm next! I been there, baby. I been there with other cunts...sorry, not anymore. I'll take you as far as California. If we can make that. After that you're on your own. Try Mexico. With all this bread, you can live like a queen.
Time to go for a walk, Jake.
I busted my leg!
And I love you too.
"Arkady"
I ... Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got.
Keep your change.  Bus three-twenty-three. Leaves at seven fifty two, tonight.
You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
Son of a bitch!
I don't want the fuckin' money! I'm not gonna give up everything I got for a lousy 50,000 dollars. It's <u>you</u>. You <u>Grace</u> or nothing. The whole thing... I want you to be my wife.... What do you way Grace?
Who was that on the phone?
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my ass.
I axed you a question.
Honest, Toby.  I just axed him for a quarter for the jukebox.
Get out of the car, spread them. You can jawbone all you want or you have the right to <u>shut the fuck up</u>! You commie motherfucker. Either way you're goin' to the can.
Yes?
No sir he is not.  I read about you in the paper.
I was in an accident once too. A horse almost trampled me to death.
Is that the entire message?
Wrap it up.
I'm listening.
I don't think I got the job in New York.
Is Jeremy okay?
Is there anything else you wanted to ask me while I'm up?... When was the last time you wore pink? When was the last time you drank soup standing up? Final call for strange questions at two in the morning.
He didn't do anything. He just told me his theory... It's sad when patients get like that. They loose reality.
Maybe it wasn't a specific moment, maybe it--
Why?
This city has had its share of disasters. Well publicized ones. It was around the time of that plane crash, when it first entered my head. And there it stayed, as I waited and watched the news over the years...  And then one day I see a news report on a train accident and its sole survivor who was miraculously unharmed.  And just like that, an idea blossoms into the flower of possible reality.
It's for last week's game.
We're not proceeding anywhere together.
You have good instincts when it comes to things like that?
I don't know what you're asking?
I have to go now.
Quick.
Stop messing with my life Elijah. My son almost shot me last night. He wanted to prove you were right.
Dunne, it's Jenkins, we got a guy at gate 17C with a bogus ticket. Says he knows you. He won't tell me his name.
When?
I think it's be better if I was alone.
You think you could beat up Mike Tyson? I mean before he started wiggin out and eating people's ears?
What if you worked out everyday for six months? You think you could beat him then?
No.
How much is it?
YOU WON'T GET HURT...
I'll just shoot him once.
Don't be scared.
You like sports?
You represent someone in Philadelphia?
Yeah, hello.
Did you get up from your seat?
How so?
Well, go get it then.
Where's Little Bill for Christ sake?
He's coming ain't he?
What'd he say?
I couldn't find no bullwhips, Bill. The German...
He tell you where them others is?
I didn't mean no offense.  I guess you're the one them cowboys cut up.  Ned an' The Kid, my partners, are they... ?
Oh. How long I been here?
You're a beautiful woman an'... if I was to want a free one, I guess I'd want you more than them others. It ain't... See... I can't have no free one on account of my wife...
Hullo, Bob. Boys, this here is English Bob.
What I heard was that you fell off your horse drunk and broke your neck.
Not really...  Maybe a couple of Peacemakers...  I imagine you could overlook those, eh, Bill? If you didn't see them... or hear them?
You leave me at the mercy of my enemies.
Damaged property. Like if I was to hamstring one of their cow ponies.
Hit your finger, huh?
Heard you done the roof yourself.
An' all them cowboys been riding that beef down to Kansas an' Cheyenne?
Word must have got all the way to Texas by now.
That is you there, ain't it, Bob? The Duck of Death?
Duke.
I was watchin' you... seein' if you was followed.
Ned's share?
He hanged him?  Shot him down?
An' Little Bill killed Ned for what I done?
He said how you was really Three Fingered Jack out of Missouri... an' Bill said "Same Three Fingered Jack that dynamited the Rock Island and Pacific in '69 killin' women and children an' all?" An' Ned says you done a lot worse than that, said you was more cold blooded than William Bonney or Clay Alisson or the James Brothers an' how if he hurt Ned again you was gonna come an' kill him like you killed a U.S. Marshall in '73.
Yeah, I guess so.
Maybe I ain't.
Oh.
What for?
Jesus!
Been gone near three years now.
Well, we was. Like you said, I changed my mind an'...
Three ways, I figured.
Well, what were you lookin' at anyhow?
An' how there was two deputies up close pointin' rifles at you... had you dead to rights... an' how you pulled out a pistol an' blew them both away to hell... an' only took a scratch yourself.  Uncle Pete told me he never seen nothin' like it, shootin' your way out of a scrape like that.
Get some sleep, Kid.
What happened? He ain't dead? What's goin' on?
Better re-load it.
They takin' water?
Yup.
First one I ever killed.
It's a hell of a thing, ain't it, killin' a man. You take everythin' he's got... an' everythin' he's ever gonna have...
Wha... what f-for?
You could have it. All of it.
P-p-p-please, I'm not armed.  M-m-my G-god. You killed... Little Bill.
I never c-c-carry arms. I'm... a writer.
Wh-wh-when confronted by superior numbers, the experienced gunfighter will fire on the best shots first.
I was lucky in the order.  I always been lucky killin' folks.
We ain't bad men no more, Bill. Hell, we're farmers.
How long you gonna be, Bill?
Eagle... he hated my guts. Bonaparte didn't like me none.
Quincy, he was always watchin' me. Scared.
Say, Bill... You ever... ever go into town... an' all?
Some fucker's shootin' at us.
HEY, KID.
Shit.
No.
I seen him.
Worms was comin' out.
Claudia... ain't here, Bill.
HOW MANY LEFT GODDAMIT?
I'm goin' on down to Kansas.
N-nobody... only you took your shotgun an' that pistol an'...
How many men you killed?  Ain't you gonna answer?
Well, I guess I woulda at least pulled my pistol an...
Jack. What are you doing here?
There was ninety-one million -
Keyser Soze
&lt;&lt;Don't be stupid.&gt;&gt;
I'11 have this thing in front of a grand jury by Monday.
Give me some credit. I got you this far, let's go to the grand jury. This is never going to stop if we -
I hope so, too, Mr. Kint. Can I get you something to drink?
You're fuckin' A right, no P.C. Well screw P.C. No right. No goddamn right. You do some time, they never let you go. Treat me like a criminal, I'll end up a criminal.
DON'T MOVE, YOU FUCKERS.
You heard right.
He's alright.
Keaton, we gotta go. They're gonna find him.
What are we gonna do?
Don't hurt me.
I was out of line.
How are they going to do it?
What-are they speaking?
My employer requires your services. One job. One day's work. Very dangerous. I don't expect all of you to live, but those who do will have ninety-one million dollars to divide any way they see fit.
Listen to me, cocksucker. There is no Keyser Sate. If you say his name again, I'11 kill you right here.
No matter. Kill away, Mr. McManus.
Better you hear it from me now than somebody else later.
The job got thrown to me by this lawyer.
He wants to meet you. He called last night and asked me to set it up. What do I tell him'
No, no, no, no, no.
Sure. Fifteen years ago, but he was a good thief Anyway, the cops wouldn't let him go legit.
You trying to get a rise out of me, Agent Kujan?
You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer, Verbal?
There's nothing in there about Ruby.
So this lawyer...
Oh, but it's not. If I hadn't been nailed in Illinois for running a three card monte in between sets, I never would have took off for New York. I never would have met Keaton, see. That barber shop quartet was the reason for everything.
What call?
I wanted to. I thought we could make it.
Don't shine me, Verbal. No more stalling. You know what I'm getting at.
I don't understand what you're saying. I saw Keaton get shot, I swear to you.
He was a stool pigeon for the Justice Department. He swore out a statement to Federal Marshals that he had seen and could positively identify one Keyser Soze and had intimate knowledge of his business, including, but not exclusive to, drug trafficking and murder.
There were no drugs on that boat. It was a hit. A suicide mission to whack out the one man that could finger Keyser Soze so Sate had a few thieves put to it. Men he knew he could march into certain death.
You posted twenty minutes ago. Captain Leo wants you out of here a.s.a.p., unless you turn state's.
Counselor, you're insulting me.
Mr. Abraham...
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
... tell me about this case.
So what I want to do is stop it here.  I'm going to make him an offer.  I want to do it myself.  I want it to come from me.
I know that answer.  If we went to trial would we win?
Whatever the `truth' is, let's hear that.  You were her doctor.
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby.  Were you not?
Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat.  Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby...Ms.Nevins...
Objection!
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor.  Certified in Internal Medicine?
How is that?
How old are you?
Yes, we've heard that.  Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians?  Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
Mr. Concannon...?
Objection!  This is ri...expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that.  Isn't that right?
And wasn't that an oath...?  These are your initials here:  K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath.  No less important than that which you took today.   Isn't that right?   Isn't that right...?
That's not my handwriting.
...what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it fouryears?  This is a...why?  Why would you do that?
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up.  Who do you think you are?    Who do you think you are...?
If I could accept the offer right now, I would.  They took it back.
Dr. Thompson...?
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes.  In your opinion is his estimate correct?
And you wrote that...
Yes.
The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of ...
Well, well, when can we meet again. I'd like to get a deposition..
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
I'll just take a minute.  Deborah Ann Kaye.  You know what I'm talking about.  The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
I can subpoena you, you know.  I can get you up there on the stand.
Yessir.  I'm sorry.
That's it...?    Come on, guys...life is too short...  You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it.    Frank:  I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand...and that's a lot of money...and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records.
...that's true.  Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.    I myself would take it and run like a thief.
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
Sustained.  Yes.  The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.
Galvin, look, many years ago...
Are you done?
Exception!
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
Hello, I'm calling from...
Pardon?
We find that your subscription lapsed...
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
My name's Frank.  And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
Why don't you get some rest?
You do what you want.  You want to leave...You want to go kill yourself?
You told me so.  Maybe you'd get some sympathy.  You came to the wrong place.
Oh, yes, I do, Joe.  Believe me. You say you're going to lose.  Is it my fault?  Listen!  The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
Is it over?
... now who is that ...?
Mick.  Mick.  Mick...
...I have to stand up for her...
What I'm saying, they're getting some help.
Yeah?  How's our new witness?
And all we've got is a witch doctor!
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
...four years ago...
It's not a good case.  It's a very good case.  A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anaesthetic ...
Yes.  Yes, I have.
He saw her at the Northern Care...
We just can't do it anymore.   This is our chance to get away.
She told me.
Hi.
I've been meaning to come in a long time.
Uh-huh.  My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
Mrs. Simmonds.
Yes.
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
Another, Frank . . . ?
Dr. Towler...
...of the procedures...
...they start again three minutes earlier...
And you like it.
Shouldn't you be sitting down?
Not what you think. We're very happily married.
Watched her come out of the apartment, someone I didn't know... walking in a different way... holding her head in a way I didn't know; and get into her car, and drive out to...  Golden Gate Park. Five miles. She sat on a bench at the edge of the lake and stared across the water to the old pillars that stand an the far shore, the Portals of the Past. Sat there a long time, not moving... and I had to leave, to got to the office. That evening, when I came home, I asked what she'd done all day. She said she'd driven to Golden Gate Park and sat by the lake. That's all.
The speedometer of her car showed she had driven 94 miles that day. Where did she go?  I have to know, Scottie. Where she goes and what she does, before I got involved with doctors.
How can I see her, to know her?
Yes.
Great-grandmother. The child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death - was Madeleine's grandmother.
He had no right to say that. It was my responsibility. You didn't know her. I shouldn't have got you involved.
No, she's all right. She's still here. But I'll get her home soon.
Hello?
No, there are just a few things I want to ask you, and --
I told you! Right here!
Listen, what is this? What do you want?
Will you have dinner with me?
Well... I've been on blind dates before... Matter of fact, to be honest, I've been picked up before.  Okay.
Oh, I understand, all right. I've been understanding since I was seventeen. And the next step is, as long as you're going to see me tomorrow, why don't you stay the night.
As friends? We'd just see a lot of each other as friends, and you'd "take care of me"?
There's Ransohoff's. Nothing but the best. Come on.
But I loved the second one she wore. And this one --  -- is beautiful.
Judy, it can't make much difference to you. I just want to see how you'd look and I know it won't be the same, but --
The trouble is, I'm gone now. For you. And I can't do anything about it. I want you to love me. If I let you change me, will that do it? If I do what you tell me, will you love me?
Well?
That's what I had in mind.
I'm suddenly hungry. Would you rather go somewhere else?
We're going awfully far.
But why? Why here?
No, I don't want to go. I want to stay here.
We're going up the tower, Madeleine.
We're going up the tower.
Why am I here? What happened?
Where were you?
Because I love it so. It's beautiful there. Especially at sunset.  Ah... thank you for the fire.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.
Wandering about.
When you...  There were pins in my hair...
You could have looked in my car. Oh, but you didn't know my car, did you?
Oh, yes! The whole thing must have been so embarrassing for you!
I couldn't mail it; I didn't know your address. But I had a landmark. I remembered Coit Tower and it led me straight to you.
Their true name is Sequoia Sempervirens: always green, ever- living.
Where?
There's a name on the gravestone.
I'm not mad. I'm not mad. And I don't want to die, but there's someone inside me, there's a somebody else, and she says I must die... Scottie, don't let me go!
It was a dream, you're awake, you're all right, now. Can you tell me?
-- and an old wooden hotel of the old California days, and a saloon... dark... low-ceilinged... with hanging oil lamps.
You've been there before. You've seen it.
No... we're together...
There are things I have to tell you, about how we met, and why we are together. But they can wait. The only important thing now is that I love you and I'm going to keep you safe.
Why?
Madeleine --
And if you lose me, you'll know that I loved you and wanted to go on loving you.
Let me go into the church alone.
I can't imagine that sweet girl with that dear face --
Yes, that's it. Sweet name, isn't it?  Foreign. But sweet.
Oh, but she hasn't been here today. Scottie whirls back on her.
Ow!!
It's this darned corset. It binds. He retrieves the stick.
Midge, do you suppose many men wear corsets?
What do you mean?
You sound so disapproving, Midge.
I know. Everybody tells me.
Mmm. Why don't you go away for a while?
It's brand new. Revolutionary uplift. No shoulder straps, no back straps, but does everything a brassiere should do. It works on the principle of the cantilever bridge.
Aren't you ever going to get married?
Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?
I got a call from him today. Funny. He dropped out of sight during the war, and I'd heard he'd gone East. I guess he's back.  It's a Mission number.
Well, I'm on the bum; I'll buy him a couple of drinks and tell him my troubles. But not tonight. If you won't drink with me, I'll drink alone, tonight. 
Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it?
I think I can lick it.
Now, that's the kind of greeting a girl likes.  None of this "hello you look wonderful" stuff. Just a good straight "who do you know" --
Oh!  You mean Gay Old Bohemian Days of Gay Old San Francisco!  The juicy stories? Like who shot who in the Embarcadero August, 1879?
The poor thing....
Now then, Johnny-O; pay me.
Out!
I'm not telling you what I think! I'm telling you what he thinks!
Around.
Well, I detected an undercurrent.
What I've been doing?
Oh, I'm having a wonderful time! I've gone back to my first love... painting.
Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this.
Oh, yes! It may need some slight alterations, but it is madam's size.  All right, dear.  We'll have it for you to try in a moment.
Jesus.
How ya doing?
It's really a stupid opinion. You have developed an annoying habit of talking for what seems to be no other reason than to hear yourself speak.
No, because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about, which makes 85% of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me.
Tonight we return once again to the cave. Tonight we let the monsters out. We fill ourselves with the spirits of Genghis Khan, Joe Namath, JFK, Paton, Lombardi, Hemingway...
I don't know why the floor was wet!
What are you doing?
What do you think you are doing?
Stop it! Listen to me. Let's just take a second here and take hold of the situation, OK? Let's just review our options here.
Stop it!
I'm calling the police.
Have you completely lost your mind? So you get her out of here. So you get her out into the desert somehow, without anybody seeing, so what, you don't think at some point somebody might notice that she's gone?
Her blood is all over the bathroom. I'd say that's a bit of a DNA problem.
How do you figure?
She's Asian. They don't have Jews in Asia.
Well what the fuck are we supposed to do?
Fuck you Boyd!
What?
Who? What are you talking about?
Honey, go in there and get some Starbursts.
We'll be ready Adam.
No. No. No. It's what my father said to me. He said it and he meant it... He said to me...He said, Adam, he said...He told me and I heard him... he said...  Hell he said so many Goddamn things I can't remember everything he said for Christsake.
Are you solid with that?
I tell mine that they're little men. I tell them they're strong. They make me feel joy. I let 'em know. So they really know that I need them just as much. You know. Just as much man. And you know, you're their godfather...
If anything ever happens to me...
I want you to hear me out.
My god.
Money?
What is it?
What?
She's not here.
She's in the bathroom...she's still working.
Is everything okay?
Your investment ideas never work out.
I don't think so Boyd.
He's too drunk.
You said that Boyd.
Tony? This is Keith Fisher. You're doing my wedding and I'm calling about the chair situation. Yeah, I'll hold.
Call 911.
Oh for Christsake Boyd. Somebody must know she's here.
It goes; "Today is the first day of the rest of our lives."
Fisher had a less than normal relationship with that Donkey.
The problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left...
OK. Definitely not cool! Definitely inappropriate behavior here.
I just want to get married.
What's your point?
Regarding what?
Good deal. Lois just wants to hear it from Micheal.
Okay fine.
Blood money. Insurance dollars that you have thus fucking far decided not to tell me about at all. In no way have you mentioned that money. And I find that to be very very offensive.
And if you think you can fuck me, don't. Cause I'm fucking insulated Fisher. Protected. Backed up on floppy. Do you get me? I want my fucking money!
There's my point exactly.
Take Mexico.
This is going to stop right now. Right now!
We're goosed! Goosed by God!
Stop it!
Stop.
Yea...It's great...seems like...I don't know you've got all the important stuff in there.
These rings represent the commitment Fisher and Liz make to each other on the day. Fisher do you take Liz to be your beloved wife, to respect, honor and cherish till death do you part?
This is ridiculous.
Did you send in all of the deposit checks?
What do you mean, you think so?
Florist?
Caterer?
You forgot the tent?
What else have you forgot?
Stop it. I'm sorry.
Are we going to do this again?
He's my friend. He's not a moron.
I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships...
Time out.
That's absurd.
How much?
Seating problems.
I need your help.
Do you love me?
Take care of those chairs.
Just a bit of organizing.
Yeah. Nesting.
Hello.
Where are you?
How late?
What okay?
You sound funny. Did you do cocaine?
Yeah. Sure.
Everything's OK. Just some more preparations.
Cancel?! Cancel?! Are you out of your fucking mind?!
Lois is a mess and Micheal's really upset. Everyone's upset.
I know.
Don't we already have someone to do that for us?
Cry for Boom Boom. It's okay.
I told Boyd two fucking minutes!
I don't know. He could have told someone. He could have, like in the event of his death, somehow let someone know where those bodies are buried.
But...
I could have done it better. I'm a fucking ball-buster I am.
Just kills me...
That's just insecurity.
It means she's insecure.
Mike Brenn. Yes. Yes. 14.3 at 7.5 for 6. At 29.83 at 9.  I'm amazed the windows don't blow out of their fucking sockets with all the repressed, ass-puckering rage in these soul-less lizards.
I'm not breathing right.
I don't care for him.
The sparkler would burn hot, then hotter, then even hotter...and there would be one moment of pure burn when that little fucker would cook just perfect. Perfect. It would only last a second, but that second was it. It was it. That's what dad had us looking for...You get me?
He said he was the Brain Trust. Said he was smarter than all of us. He started reading "Atlas Shrugged," staring at himself in the mirror.
I guess.
Smart. Smart. Smart. Think big picture, take your time. I wish I had.
You see for me it's over. Over baby. I'm gonna turn myself in. After the wedding of course. After the wedding. Out of respect.
Give them to Refugio.
Which couch?
Yes, Uncle. How are you?
Was that difficult to get?
Come down here, you scamp.
If you like, I will come with you tomorrow to the village when you leave.
I should like you to do something for me. It's an innocent sort of thing but I'm very set on it.
How strange you are! When I asked you to do this favor for me you refused. You seemed almost offended. And now, here you are, making me so very happy all of a sudden. Thank you, my child!
You must think I'm mad.
Think about it. Don't hurry. Think it over.
Don't lie. You don't believe me either.
Me?
My God, what have you done to him!
Ramona! Ramona!
Why the bad temper?
She's mad.
Maybe afterwards he'll let me ...
I don't want you to untie me. Kill him and then I'll give you the money.
I don't know; I can't remember. But I'm sure he loved you.
Well... is it so urgent?
I don't know anything about these things, Jorge ...
You won't get much done with those people. Those times are over! You ought to let me kick them out.
Yes. Why?
How are you today?
You cannot leave ...
Why are you crying?
It's a very big one.
I'll box your ears if you don't show some respect for the dead! You mustn't play under this tree.
I have no desire to see the world again, but if you order me to...
Ever since yesterday, when we heard by chance about the tragedy, we have been very anxious for you. Why didn't you write? I would have come immediately.
Forgive me if I have offended you.
How do you feel?
Have I slept long?
What?
This is the newest technology approved for general implementation. It's called a locater implant. Every parolee gets one.  We're going to know where you are every second for the rest of your life.
Barnes wouldn't kill two innocent guards.
Before you, nobody else had gotten close enough to Sid 6.7 to take a shot at him. Hell, nobody else had even been able to start tracking him before he got to them first.  New scar —— you making it okay in there?
Jesus Christ.  Can you kill it?
Officers in Toluca Lake just found an affluent couple...completely gutted.  So were the first two cops to arrive on scene.
Sid 6.7 is now armed.
... illegal search of Lindenmeyer' s duplex. Eleven civilian vehicles damaged or destroyed. Twenty—four citizen complaints. And the calls are just starting to come in...  I forgot what it's like to have you on the streets.
Ms. Deane, you wanted to see me?
You know how much man power you're talking about?
What did Cox pull him out early for?
What the hell happened?
You've had a year—and—a—half to make all the adjustments you want, Lindenmeyer.  ) Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances. Neither do I. You're fired.
It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs...  It's a physiological machine.
As far as the public is concerned, it is. The reason you got fired, and I got my second demo into production, is I'm a lot smarter than you. I never give my best stuff away.
You catching my drift?
I am beautiful, aren't I?
You actually listen to all those tapes?
If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence.
I need to know what snapped in you. What made you capable of it. You have to make me understand.
He was re—enacting Charles Manson's LaBianca murders.
I've spent over 50 hours interviewing him.  Charlie killed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca because of the ugly way the members of his family had butchered Sharon Tate. After seeing the blood bath on television, he wanted to show them how it should be done.  The question is, what does Charlie have to do with Sid 6.7?
You've got a problem with me carrying a gun?
Remember the bowling ball bag Sid carried with him in virtual reality?
Want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house?
Don't worry about it, all right?
Don't get out of the car.
What's the problem?
Which way?
We know you didn't kill those guards.
The rally's a little obvious as a target, don't you think?
Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes.
Nice work.
Find out anything?
Aren't you going to watch with me?
To the first LETAC engineer to go into production on prototypes.
As long as they keep overpaying me, I'll keep overpaying you.  ) Just make goddam sure you can have 10 of them ready for deployment around the city by next month.
...on the way in.
Waal, Mr. Moss, I wouldn't....
No, this is great.
He, uh, has he been in the "jail" long?
...his Triumphal Plane.  Shot Down.
You can't tell this story.  He's not kidding you.  You can't tell this story.  <u>You</u> knew that.  The pay off was, you get to be Ambassador, or...
Who we got here...?
Alright.  Look here, any of you kids hear in this room:  what you hear here, what you say here, what you <u>do</u> here, f'it got out, you leaked it.  Tell'em what they need to know.
We're going to have to explain away the...
<u>Do</u> it...
What would do that...?
Tell me again.
...you want us to go to War...
Precisely.
...where is the Back End coming from?
Why is this putz on the air...
New York Times, Wash Post, Detroit Register, San Diego BEE, all in emission.  <u>No</u> mention of the Girlscout. None.
Stanley Moss, Ladeesngennlmen... And she says...
...uh huh...
Speaking of thanks... we puttem back in, what does your fellow Moss want?
How long you been up, you need a nap.
...this is magnificent.
And I'd like to point out that I've been on prescription <u>medication</u>, the side-effects of which...
Oh, God...
Oh, Lord....
War's over, Pal. 
Pride of a job-well-done...
All Combat takes place at night, in the Rain, and at the Junction of four Map Segments...
And I take this <u>opportunity</u> to suggest that, equally, I admit to <u>nothing</u>, and that I would like my lawyer present.
...where is my pill?
THE PRESIDENT, HOLDING THE PHOTOGRAPH
Nobody whose name you want me to say, Mr. Young, I promise you.
Ask it.
Why do people go to war?
...Yes.
Is there a press conference today?
China.
Touchdown, Andrews, fourteen hundred, today.
There <u>is</u> no B-2 Bomber,
Do I know you?
What one has to do, Mr. Moss.  Is to fight a holding action.
String a few together.  All I need's eleven,
Remember the Maine...
How the fuck do <u>we</u> know.  You take my point?
N'it's a crying shame.  But you <u>staged</u> the Oscars...
...Yoha, Yoha... Yoha.  <i>Why</i> Albania?
King, King, I got a thing here, a product placement, gonna have a bigger back-end than Hattie McDaniel. Now:
What is it?
In the Folk Music Section.
...this the Guy.
...we get our hands on him?
What?
Mmm...
Hey, our job ends at the Finish Line.
They should be.  Most valuable animal since Sea Biscuit.  <u>Isn't</u> he...
...a masterpiece...
He's going to be fine, aren't you boy...?
...what happened...?
Uh huh...why?
I'm tired.
He's supposed to be flying in from Europe.
Hell of a show.  Hell of a job, Stan.
No, the deal <u>isn't</u> changed.  The Deal <u>isn't</u> changed. You can't ... what is it?  Money?  <u>Money</u>?  You want Money?
William Schuman.  Old Shoe.  U.S. Army.  Serial number, 21-31-2841-262.
It's like those Japanese in the Caves on Okinawa... didn't believe the War was Over.
All part of the Service we Render.
Why can't it be a ribbon?
I didn't ask for a dog.
It's tough to rhyme.
Oh huh...
Someone's bringing in a kitten...?
...where's my l'il <u>pill</u>?
Yup.
Oh, hell...
Lemme talk to him.  Will?  Shoe?
Hi...can I buy you a drink? I'm celebrating tonight.
Grand Marnier.
Wanna play some tennis Saturday?
...you take that Anacott Steel?
Buddy, buddy, buddy; little trouble, huh, today.
...got tickets for the Knicks tonight. Go out and cruise some bimbos afterwards, whaddaya say?
Gimme a break. You buy Bluestar Airlines yesterday. Today they just happen to get good news and the stock goes bat shit. You must have ESP. A real Nostradamus.  Jesus Christ, what are friends for?
You know what you need, buddy buddy--an optorectomy. That's when they cut the nerve that runs from your brain to your rectum--to change that shitty attitude of yours.
I agree. Go thou and sin no more.
The stock's going to Pluto!
...leave me alone willya. Only thing makes me feel good anymore. Spaghetti. She makes lousy spaghetti...
Speak English will ya.
I told you not to go into that racket. You could've been a doctor or a lawyer,
you coulda stayed at Bluestar and been a supervisor in instead of going customer relations by now, 'stead of going off and bein' a salesman.
So come home and live rent free, 'stead of that cockroach palace you live in. $50,000 Jesus Christ, the world is off its rocker. I made $37,000 last year and you...
... it adds up Buddy, 300 here, 200 there. Your brother never...  ...well, I always said money is something you need in case you don't die tomorrow...
...same, pain in the ass, god bless her, talks too much... gonna take her to Florida next month... west coast, near Tampa, like to get out for good, but can't afford it.
What brings you out here...
Your words, not mine...
I guess it's time to hit the road.
Didn't he tell you?  That's so like Gordon. Get dressed, we're going out.
So, does "this guy" have a tip for an honest lawyer?
Gekko asked us into the Bluestar deal. We're reviewing the timetables, wanna come?
Within 45 seconds, a microprocessor computes your systolic and diastolic pressure. Has an LCD readout, and it's cost effective -- less than one visit to the doctor.
So what firm you with, pal?
...rings a bell somewhere. So what?
Hi sport.
See this? Can you believe it? Two inch screen...
...come on sport, you gotta try harder, I need some exercise for chrissake...
The most valuable commodity I know of is information. Wouldn't you agree on that?
I'll be right there, fix them a drink.
You're walking between the raindrops kid. I expect Sir Larry is choking on his royal chamber pot by now.
He's right. I had to sell. The key to the game is your capital reserves. You don't have enough, you can't pee in the tall weeds with the big dogs.
You don't understand. I want to be surprised...astonish me, sport, new info, don't care where or how you get it, just get it... My wife tells me you put a move on Darien. Here's some inside info for you. That Euroflash GQ guy she's going with's got big bucks but he's putting her feet to sleep. Exit visas are imminent. So don't lose your place in line.  Oh, jeez, I wish you could see this. The lights coming up over the water. I've never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at this moment.  ...an old Russian proverb - "a fisherman always sees another fisherman from afar." I like you sport, I ever tell you that... Gordon, call me Gordon from now on.
The art of which is deception. Spread the buy orders through different accounts and you won't get burned...
The three unions. It's 43% of Bluestar's operating budget, the hourly cost of a flight crew is $850 an hour, that's the real hidden value G.G., if you can negotiate that out, get a crew down to $350-400 an hour a run, this airline is gonna be the hottest thing since Texas Air...
I didn't know we had a meeting schedule for this morning.
Last night I read Rudy the story of Winnie the Pooh and the Honey pot. Know what happened: he stuck his nose in that honey pot once too often and got stung.
It's all about bucks, kid, the rest is conversation...  Bud, you're still going to be president. And when the time comes, you'll parachute out a rich man. With the money you're going to make, your father won't have to work another day in his life.
The richest one percent of this country owns half the country's wealth: 5 trillion dollars. One third of that comes from hard work, two thirds of it comes from inheritance, interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what I do -- stock and real estate speculation. It's bullshit. Ninety percent of the American people have little or no net worth. I create nothing; I own. We make the rules, Buddy, the news, war, peace, famine, upheaval; the cost of a paper clip.  We pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it...  ...you're not naive enough to think we're living in a democracy are you, Buddy? It's the free market. You're one of us now...take advantage of it. You got the killer instinct, kid, stick with me. I got things to teach you...
Hello Bud.
Not really. I'd say that Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around. He has a great eye and he only buys the best. Like this rug for instance, a silk Tabriz, the finest of its kind. The day after he bought it in London, a dealer representing the Saudi Royal Family offered him twice what he paid. It absolutely makes the room. See how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa... although...  I don't know if I would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery - too dingy. And it's a sacrilege having that Pre-Columbian pot in the center of the coffee table. Some dope might use it as an ashtray.
What if I have a previous engagement?
I guess this must be destiny alright. My first yuppie apartment and...  my first yuppie.
You have modest wants. I like that in a man.
Let's get things straight, Bud. I'm not going to take a cut. I worked hard and you can't decorate a room in New York for less than $100,000. Curtains alone...
I'm sorry. I was afraid something like this could happen.
Buddy, it's not your fault, and it's not your decision.
Don't cross Gordon. He'll crush you. You've worked hard to get where you are. If Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar someone else will; and who's to say they won't do the same thing.
I'm not looking to just survive. I've been doing that all my life.
You really mean that?  What'd he promise you? To take you public? I guess without Gordon's money and seal of approval, I'm not such a hot investment anymore. You're just the best money can buy, Darien...
You got a look in your eye, Mr. Mannheim... You got something for the small fry...
You're right, Mr. Mannheim, but you gotta get to the big time first, then you can be a pillar and do good things.
You told him about us?
I want to ask you a big favor, Gordon. Please drop the Bluestar deal.
He respond to the offer? What? What the hell's Cromwell doing giving lecture tours when his company's losing 60 million a quarter? I guess he's giving lectures on how to lose money...if this guy opened a funeral parlor, no one would die, this turkey's totally brain dead...Well Christmas is over and business is business.  Keep buying. Dilute the sonofabitch. Ollie I want every orifice in his body flowing red.
Rarest pistol in the world, Larry, a .45 Luger. Only six were ever manufactured.
We know what you're up to, Gekko, and let me tell you this from here,  you suck eggs, mister, over my dead body you ain't gonna break up Bluestar.
I saw the greatest movie with mark last night
Doctor? Lawyer? CHINA Lawyer, Doctor, I don't care.
But?
We need to talk. CHINA Yeah about what?
A little what? CHINA See.  You don't even speak French.
Weird and tiny huh?
And your coff - excuse me, caffeine sir
And uh, your nicotine sir
Can I give her a message?
Tony and China?
Guys, if I'm going to play the hero at least give me a little room.
This time I really don't see anyone man.
No thank you sir we're fine.
If you sold your soul to the devil, you'd never age either
Any student of Black Magic can do it.   .most of these books will tell you how! SARAH So what happens when you've sold out?
Can this be stopped?
Darling?  I hear you were having drinks with the butler the other night.  Now  you know that sort of thing leads to anarchy.
One has to keep the distance between `them' and `us'
When - you're a big boy.  I mean you know it's bad for you
You bet.  We all can't be such modern people 
Yes?
Besides, Dad would have freaked.
I think playing in a band called "Bitch" might put a dent in the whole "perfect family" thing.
Who's idea was it?
Because he was worried about me.
Why is he worried?
These are good.
I saw her in the water.  Beside me.  She was filling the bathtub.
Pretty.  She's a blond.
What's happening to me?
You think you influenced her?
Me?  No.  Well, in the accident I was injured, but...
Well, I'm glad.  Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know.
Well maybe your wife...
Who are you?
That's not...It's not like that.
I wanted to apologize.
Your house is so beautiful.
What's your name?
Why are you here?
Y'hear anything you'll let me know?
He was so pissed.
Well good.  So you're human.
You're discussing me with your psychic?
Absolutely.
In the window.  Norman's at work.
Mef?  What's Mef?
I have to go.
Something was there.  You saw it.
Yes.  Now I talked to Sela and there's a guy, this Pakistani guy down in Hartford...
Adamant?
What's their name?
If you have to work...
It's okay if you're not.
You did a great job.  She's a good kid.
Wanna fool around?
I'm finished at three.  No.  Squash with Stan.
Did she say that?
Claire, honey, we are not going to march next door and accuse our new neighbor of--
Nothing's going to happen.  Besides, I have to work tonight.  The conference is in less than two weeks. I've got to stay focused on that for just a little longer.  This is...
What do you mean?  Some noises where?
Think I may have cracked it.
"...of Perpetual Distances."  Everybody's checking their shoelaces. Pins drop.  "I'm afraid you've mistaken me,"  I say...
"...for my father."
Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe.
When?
Oh.
...like it never even happened...
You're not at the center.
I don't need a shrink.
Are you lonely?
Keep your voice down.
I'm sorry...
You know I am.
A cheap wine glass from the caterers.  You started crying.  I tried to comfort you...
The...
I thought it was Mrs. Feur, but it's not...
I take it your not mad at me.
Ow!
"You know..."
THAT'S NOT TRUE!  You wanted to quit!  And then when you did, you hated me for it... so you gave it all to her.
We have to get out of here.
Little village down seven.  Supposed to be charming.
I know.
She's out there isn't she?  She's in the lake.
I don't believe you.
I have seen him again.  Last night.
Are you alright...?  You look pale.
With his hands!
I - r saw him as a child.  Lots of times...  But no one else did.
A what...?
You two sees like a perfect fit.   Only two mounths...?
When is the funeral...?   I am coming to my mother's funeral!!
She was alive all these years... You NEVER let me know her. Who gave you that right...?!
I don't want the -
He's shown himself to you... on the deck.  In the storm.
Massive subdural hamatoma.  We have to evacuat it - right now.
I am with you, my love. Like no other can ever be.
But I could understand. I want to understand!
I know that you're evil.
I've waited for you - the one whose science could match her powers...  Do you know what it's like - to sense the majesty of something so sublime just beyond your reach...?  to float in a dream that keeps a .promise half-hidden in its shadows.-.?  I did not choose to be such as this!  Suzanne brought me here.  She called to me!
--- and I have heard you from the beginning... from it's very first beat.
Only you...
No!
Rowan and I will be together now. My time has come.  Your time is gone.
I am your son.  I would not wound you. I could not - ever.
I don't remember you at all-  You - you saved my life-  Bizarre thing to say, isn't it...?
My jury's still out on that,
What do you see...?
Just one.  The bar's closed.
Too much... too fast...?
He's very pleased with your response to the surroundings.
Doctor's orders- - -?
I'm serious.  You don't -
Seems more like a year than a month.
Michael, do you want to wear those for the rest of your life...?
We're quite a pair, you and I.
Rowan...?
Ro - you can't really believe that. Nobody can murder someone with their feelings.  I mean --- that's CRAZY.
Even if it's all true - that doesn't make you a witch! It's 1992, Rowan!
Stop looking at me like that! I'm not some siren chanting to the moon.  And my life is not a cosmic whim!  I am in charge of my life -  - and I want to stay.  Everything that was taken from me is here, Michael. All these years, she was there without me.  Helpless. I should have been here.
Everyone - this is Michael curry.
Smoking is bad for your heart, Michael.
I took off my gloves today - with Aaron -  - and it was okay.
Wanna snack...?
Nah - I had a shmuck of an uncle named Lucas.    Grayson.
When aid you get home last night...?
Something's wrong with you.
Hi.
You've gone away from me, Ro...  Someplace I don't know how to get to.
I've never asked you to explain yourself - because you used to let me inside!  But I'm on the outside now...  you put me there!
You could kill me - right now, couldn't you...?  couldn't you...?!  Tell me the truth --- is it Lasher...?  Answer me!!
Lasher...  Where --- where is ---
Go home, Stu  I'll call you.
'Leave bees be - and the bees be nice.' Didn't your father ever teach you that...?
Wow...
You okay...?
He's got great hands.
I thought you were someone else
Its cramped in here isn't it BRIAN
Tell me BRIAN, what would happen if the client lost the key?
So there is only one key...
And it can't be forged?
What are you doing?
Oh, about six years since I graduated
Oh anywhere - whenever I needed to - Do you know how easy it is to take them? You just pick up a hiker, or someone off the streets - they believe so easily you know, 'Look, I have something to show you' I would say - and that would be it. One girl, I think her name is Debbie - she had broken down on the motorway, and I offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck - She just got in and I drove away. When I pulled into the layby and took out my knife - she just froze, and said - what do you want? - I said, You know what I want. - But she didn't. Getting rid of the bodies is just as easy - the first I cut up, put in bags with bricks in, and tossed them off Eldridge Bridge in broad daylight.  The real problem with my work is the blood - there is so much of it - and it all spurts out so fast - like a fountain. It made such a mess of
Is 'their' colour an expression of their inner self? By that I mean, extroverts wear bright colours - so what are people who wear white?
How long have you been watching me?
No...I didn't do it...I wish I had but I didn't. I was beaten to it. STEPHANIE became my mother.
What?
What's wrong?
What is it?
Why did you let him in?
I don't like sugar
It's not that - I just don't want any sugar
I haven't been using it recently LESLIE
I'm sorry, I couldn't - when is she due?
Well, what do you think?
It's been what, three years?
What brings the rats out of the sewers?
Her husband left her
Oh no sir - just making some enquiries...Just tell her that INSPECTOR TAYLOR called on you - she'll understand
I defy your hamburger theory of life, and all of the unfulfilled hopes and dreams it represents.
Think about it...Long tunnel, bright lights, it's full of vaginal symbolism.
I get it now. You and me. We're dead.
I thought I loved her.
You got everything you ever wanted.
And I was wondering.
Teddy? Would you please please please take me to the prom?
Ted, have you lost your mind?
You really don't get it, do you? I am genetically programmed to desire a big, buff, manly man who can defend and provide for me and my yet to be conceived offspring! It's, like, a caveman thing!
Well?
We can't accept it.  It's much too expensive. Right, dear?
You have to understand. This was a big shock, for all of us. One minute you're our little boy, of whom we could not be more proud. The next minute you're the owner of this whole pornographic empire.
We understand your disappointment, Teddy. Christy is a pretty, sexy, provocative, voluptuous...  We...uh...we understand your disappointment.
I remember spring break of my senior year.  Seems like a lifetime ago.
You guys are my parents.
Whatever helps you cope.
There ya go. Always remember, focus on the peach...
I paid off the mortgage! I ordered that Winnebago you always wanted! Now you're ashamed of me?
You do know how to drive?
Hey, Ted. Wanna go shopping?
After graduation...maybe we could go away together?
Teddy, I thought we were having a moment here.
So here we are. Dead. But we never want you to want for anything. That is, we want you to have everything.
No problem, consider it done.  I had this idea of shooting on location. Outdoors, you know? Maybe at some famous Xenia landmarks. You think that would be a problem?
How are the hometown folks treating you, back in Xenia?
Matter of fact, Jay, my uncle and I are planning to rethink the magazine. To expand the traditional western notions of "beauty."
Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine years old, what does she know?
Impressive. This is bigger than our whole house.
They say money can't buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile.
Mom and Dad said it's yours. They seem to think you're coming home.
I miss them, too.
You're a peach.
So, William Randolph. Your last big scoop contrasted the popularity of Rice Crispie Treats and chocolate Snickerdoodles at the annual bake sale.
I didn't know they gave them for Best Lip Gloss Retention During a Blow Job.
Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago.
I guess.
She said peanuts, you cretin.
Funny you should say "peachy."
Wow...you clean up nice.
He's on the move?
I don't know. This place seems pretty tame.
I want you to trust me.
Which explains the continued success of "Heaven" for how many decades?
What is this? Does everybody know everything I'm about to say or do every freakin' minute of the day?
Everything I am is because of you. Can you ever forgive me?
I'll be blunt. I know you can take it.
I'm warning you.
What law, Merk? Having fun? Letting down our hair on prom night?
You do like girls, don't you?
Ah, in other words, this is the apres-orgy salon?
Maybe she needs help, Ted. You should be a gentleman.
We don't allow TIPN, Ted.
I do?
I told you you could do it.
The world is a big, beautiful place.  We can open new markets in Africa and Asia.  Imagine the Dali Lhama reading our magazine.
Don't forget to tell them all your qualifications.
So far, so good. Some of them have real Angel potential.
I owe it all to you. Without your help I'd be lost.
I'd love to, but I really need to crack the books.  Final exams are coming up and I've been slacking.
Thanks, Uncle Billy. Thanks for everything.
In a hurry, are we?
Bad news.
You've got the wrong guy. The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot.
Talk to me Artie.
... is accusing me of rape.  Jimmy told me.  Apparently I'm the last to know...
All I can tell you Sam, is hang in there.  They clear you of this mess, you get reinstated, with back pay...
How you doing, Artie?
Ray.  Stop calling.  I told you the dental records will take time...
Gator can't see what's in front of it for shit.  They see out the sides.  That one don't even know Walter's arm's in his mouth.
Wasn't enough Van Ryan had to destroy the people who invested here.  He got to be old, he and his rich cronies would come down here, hunt and whore, act like assholes.  One trip he showed up with this young girl he'd picked up somewhere, gotten her pregnant then dumped her in the swamp.  That came with her.
So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half- sisters.
Try, Kelly.
Maybe she used another name.
You can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark.  You know what you get? More bark.  And more bark.  There's no core.  Tree's not good tar anything but sucking up water.  And now they can't get rid of them.  They've tried poisons. Nothing works.  They don't die.
You remember that little girl walked out of our talk at Blue Bay?
This is where she lives.  She wants to talk.  Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all.  I busted her once for possession.  she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine.
I thought of that.  Then I said, come on, you're Lombardo.  Your reputation is getting trashed.  You want to stop the bleeding.  You don't want to sit in jail for three months.  Unless...
So what about the girls?  Suzie's poor, but why would Kelly have to steal from her own mother?  Surely her father...
This one's got you working overtime, hasn't it?
Which she might have saved, if she hadn't set out to destroy the man's life.
If you want company...
Her grandmother said she'd been threatening to run away.  And I found the car at the Miami bus terminal.
Will you do me one favor?
He's leaving the country.  And I don't give a shit.
Oh, Ray... no...
Kelly's next, Gloria.
I fucked up.  I lost control of the situation, the one thing they train you for... God, what did I do?
And then what... he touched you?  Did you maybe flirt a little...
Suzie!  Did this man rape you?
Ms. Toller?
I say something funny?
Yeah, I've got family and they've got clout and now you have me.  Right?  And Sam.  Believe me, Suzie, this dickhead's not going to send you anywhere.  He's gonna try and rattle your cage, and that's it.  Stay strong and he can't do shit.
What?
Don't forget the car wash.
Kelly...
We have to stick with the plan.
Shit.  I was afraid of that.  She left this garbled message on my machine.  Can you calm her down?
That never seemed to worry you at the Glades.
Forget it.
You're not in bad shape, really.  I know you think you are, but you're not.  Let me tell you why.  Sandra Van Ryan.
There's nothing for them to get.
I just want my life back...
You're saying that Kelly was raped by Sam Lombardo.
Is that what you think?  You have friends?  Is that what they told you?
Did you become squeamish about these things before or after you bludgeoned little Suzie Toller to death with a wine bottle?  Jesus, man. It couldn't have worked out better. They're convinced Kelly whacked Suzie. I can't talk 'em out of it.  We should be celebrating.  This thing worked out just like you said, only better.
Yeah, right.
That was about as grim as it gets.
But then you knew what he was like all along... Maybe his killing Kelly was a thing you had counted on...
Seems to like some of the same places you do.  Funny you never met.
I can't, Sandy.  I've got to run.
Sandy... What's up?
No.
Just another bureaucratic foul-up. You know how these pencil-pushers are.  So, why don't you just run on back and explain what happened?
But don't pull that again.
Eight scientists.  Eight different fields of endeavor.  Hydraulics, optics, ballistics...
A giant... hydraulically operated microscope... that explodes?  Or maybe just someone who hates scientists.
Your little jack-in-the-box gun. That might be useful.
Can you fill me in here?
Thank you.
No record of him.
Willard...
Got to be somewhere that's hot. He said it was "damnably hot."
What if these tracks are just leading us to an Indian village or some old coot's mining claim?
I know!  I know!
Pull the balloon right in front of him!  We'll board the damn thing!
All right, all right... It'll be okay.  I mean, eventually it'll just run out of steam.
Well, we'll stay in touch... you know.
You didn't tell us you had this on!
He's not giving up?
Anyone?
Please do.  I'm a man who appreciates a good firearm.
Well, where I come from it kind of goes with the territory.  Texas.
Just a little insurance... against the unexpected.
Mr. President, good to see you again, sir.  Sorry about all that.
Goddamnit!  What am I doing?  What's happened to all my cigars?  Colonel Richards here has had a dozen agents on these cases for over a year.  No arrests, no leads, no clues...
Still alive.  Hmm.  I suppose that doesn't bode well for poor Bruno.
You got that right.  Now get up. We're walking out of here.
Now it's a bomb.
You're chasing a dream.
Out for a little ride in the coun- try, Airk?
You are the guardian, Willow.  You must take her to Tir Asleen.
The way has been lost in time. But there is one person, a druid sor- ceress, who might guide you there. She was exiled by Queen Bavmorda many years ago.  Her name is Fin Raziel.
You are very important, Willow.
You!  Are you the mother of that child?
Gawd...you're...beautiful...
Why did you say that?
We're a tiny version of all that?
Don't make me angry, Peck.
Nobody's gonna take your baby. Know why?  Nobody cares...  Except me.  You wanna go back to your farm. You wanna go back to your family. I could take care of that baby. I'll look after her like she was me own.
Fresh goat's milk.
You!!
Time to change her diaper.
I was in love once, Willow.  She had a hold on my heart.  I could barely function.  I *was* a great swordsman!  I was knighted!  I could have been king!
She said lots of thing.s
She's a bird, Willow.
Watch it!
It's not a Nelwyn baby.
Kill him!
I'm all finished.  Now what?
We don't have much time left!  Go on!  Go on!
Ouch!!
Again:  what is the magician's weapon?
Time is running out.
Elves!  They're always tormenting babies.  They make them cry and take their tears.
Watch this.  Right between the eyes.
Are you sure?
She needs to be changed again. Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow changes the baby.  Soon the baby stops crying.  Re- lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror. Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the fire.  Then his eyes focus on the fire.
I'm getting her out of there!
Eat up, Book. What's the matter with your appetite?
Tell you what – I'm going to let you handle this one. But only if you promise not to say anything to your momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't understand.
What have you got?
You know who?
Last guy I would have figured. But he's part of it.
If I did, I'd have kept my mouth shut...  It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago... Guess who was in on the collar? Mac.  He salts it away somewhere... he knows the stuff is potent, but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it. But they do now.  And now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum.
What's your first move?
Where are you taking us?
What was that?
Whacking?
Look, I'm genuinely sorry...
But why would they murder...
Who are they?
I should tell you these do not have buttons.  See? Hooks and eyes.
Vain. Proud. Such a person is Hochmutsnarr. He is not plain.
You make fun of me. Like the tourists. Driving by all the time. Some even come into the yard. Very rude. They seem to think we are quaint.
Where's the nearest telephone?
Well... the store at Saltzburg...  But you won't be going to Saltzburg for a while.
But Stoltzfus said...
You should not bother with that birdhouse.  If you're leaving tomorrow.
That's God's way!
Yeah... I can put it all together when I get back, 'Til then, you know nothing, understand? Business as usual...
Either you're a member of the club or you aren't, Elton.  Tell me what you know...
Good morning.
What's so funny?
God, Fred...
Rachel, this is a man's life, we hold it in our hands.
How can this be? How can you do such a thing? Is this plain? Is this the ordnung?
Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this man to our house. With his gun of the hand. You bring fear to this house. Fear of English with guns coming after. You bring blood and whispers of more blood. Now English music... and you are dancing to English music! And you call this nothing?
I am not a child.
What about Carter?
He's not in this building.
Momma... are they angry with us.
Aunt Em!
Auntie Em, really -- you know what Miss Gulch said she was gonna do to Toto?  She said she was gonna --
-- no place like home -- there's no place like home -- no place --
But I did leave you, Uncle Henry -- that's just the trouble.  And I tried to get back for days and days.
Look at you, Zeke -- you're just as white --
Well, Dorothy was walking along the --
To see?
Frightened?  You are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death -- sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe.  I was petrified.  Then suddenly the wind changed, and the balloon floated down into the heart of this noble city, where I was instantly acclaimed Oz, the First Wizard de Luxe!
...didn't you?
Ahh!  Ah!
The Munchkins are happy because you have freed them from the Wicked Witch of the East.
Yes, I'm ready now.
And think to yourself -- "There's no place like home; there's no place like home; there's no place like home."
Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
Yes --
Oh --
...room --
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all right?
Well, suppose the Wizard wouldn't get me one when we got there?
Can't that female take no for an answer?
Dorothy!
Oh, my!
A home --
Yes -- let's run!
Because I'm still scared!
Oh -- Oh, come on.
As Monarch of the Forest I don't like the situation.
They're coming back!
Oh, no -- I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again.
I don't blame you for that.
Hooray!  We're off to see a Wizard!
Oh, I'll try!  Really, I will.
Hooray!  I guess that did it!  Help yourself.
But you've just been saying how much you want a heart.
...along.
-- A hot water bottle would be good if we had one.
Dear, whatever shall we do?
Yeah.
...excellence to the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company -- until one day, while performing spectacular feats of stratospheric skill never before attempted by civilized man, an unfortunate phenomena occurred. The balloon failed to return to the fair.
Would...would it do any good if I roared?
What happened?
I've got a plan how to get in there.
That's right.
You humbug!
Now, let' s see -- this goes -- Oh, I wish I were better at puzzles.
...the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door!
Quiet!
...of the West.
I'm not afraid of her.  I'll see you get safely to the Wizard now, whether I get a brain or not!  Stuff a mattress with me! Hah!
That's right.
I'd be gentle as a lizard --
Then I'm sure to get a brain --
Oh - oh, poor Dorothy!
Ha -- ha -- ha --
No, you don't.
How can I ever thank you enough?
Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones. No jokes, I’ve heard them all.
When this is over we should bury the hatchet. Celebrate. A champagne dinner?
The plutonium is missing.  They’ve taken the core!
Elektra King?  Are you insane?  This is her pipeline.
But why? Eight million people would die, the land irradiated for a hundred years. A cloud of radiation the size of Europe...
The King pipeline.
Is there another way?
Old friend?
I’ve scheduled a medical for you.
You haven’t been given an assignment in this case.
It’s a message.  He wants us to know he’s back.
Sir Robert tried to deal with the kidnapping with his own...resources, at first. When Elektra’s ear was delivered to him in the post, he came to me.  I advised against paying the ransom. I knew it was Renard. I played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him.
They’re getting their weapons from the Russians, but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons?  I can’t help thinking...the person close to King, the one who switched that pin...
I see my friend Davidov ran into some difficulty.
God no. All those horrible loved ones and relatives. I don’t want to talk to those people. I just want to...talk to my father.  I loved him.  I’m not sure he knew that.
Does this look familiar to you?
The killer doesn’t want to see this pipeline continue, doesn’t want to see you take over...
You don’t take no for an answer, do you?
I can’t stay.
The way I acted, in the snow...you must think I’m a coward.
What the hell are you doing here?
If this little show is for my benefit, I’ll take you home right now.
What’s wrong with you?  Are you crazy?
Are you saying...Renard is the man who’s trying to kill me?
I don’t know what you’re talking about!
You, of course. I need some information.
Mafia warlords, Diplomats and spies, consortiums from every country in the world.  A nice little rat’s nest.
That too. Everyone does what they can to survive.
Where’s the sub going?!
Mother of God.
The Maiden’s Tower.
In the good old days, the KGB had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing. But Yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo.
I’ll send someone out.
Perhaps this isn’t the time...
Warm.
Why are you like this?  Because Bond is dead?  It’s what you wanted.
We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.
He would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a call from Washington.
Walter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to hear.
There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest response, I can't help you.  I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.
A whore fucking.
That man, then, he was the first.  The first you --
Rorschach's on the case.  He's got Dreiberg in a lather.  He seems to think that someone is "stalking" the Watchmen.
In the immediate future we're on Mars.  I'm telling you goodbye. You're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .
This whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time?
Jon, does anybody know what the hell you're talking about?  Dan's just an ordinary guy, but he talks to me.  When he looks at me he's seeing something more than just a -- a collection of atoms.
Then it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've always known.
Because you can't, I know, it's preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot.  Jon.  This, this "script" you're following . . . who writes it?
You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.
Jon -- for God¹s sake, what do you see?
She's with me.
Gentlemen, the past.  Unfolding before your eyes.  Stand back from the field.  It'll blow you to bits.
I¹m not.
That's the one.  Whatever happened to him?
They're not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone, we're right on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the Watchmen.
No wonder Adrian's rich.  You use that stuff?
Old?
Eight cops?  Oh, great.  A jury's gonna love that.
God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.
What's he doing?
So do I.  So do you.
. . . That was quick.
I can fix it.
I did not.  Now get out of my way!
Their real names, please.
You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move it.
Oh, I am, honey.  You see, Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan border this very minute.  And we are all of us, every living soul, in deep, deep shit -- because our number-one strategic weapons has finally flipped out.
Two things I hate.  Street mimes . . . users of recreational drugs.
Gila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .
Call off the cat and I'll kill you, Veidt.
Alright, Cage, you've got me. This is one of those moments. "Many are called, few are chosen", that kind of thing. Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge?
Why is that?
Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.
Sure as gravity. I've had a feeling about you from the start, Cage. It's nausea.
You've really got me confused, Cage. On the one hand you showed leadership, courage under fire, a willingness to protect men you hardly knew... and on the other you have an arrest record that pegs you as near sociopathic. Help me out here. I'm not following your evolution.
Is that all?
Thought you bought the farm down there, X. Glad as hell to see you.
You know what they say, the only way to change the system is from the inside.
But programmable. And expendable.
We're on to the game, ese. You got the fake blood splattered all over the walls, you got your torture tools... It's all very cute. But come on, let's quit while you're ahead. I'm only trying to save you a beatin'.
Next we got a Siberian redneck, Viktor. Into snowmobiles and snowboarding. So naturally, he covers prostitution and the drug trade.
This guy's kinda dorky lookin'.
Who are you?
I also remember you drove your car here. Who are you really? Make no mistake, I will shoot you and not feel bad about it. Who are you working for?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Whoever sent you knew what they were doing. You and Yorgi are practically twins. Two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but don't say much.
You agree with a lot of what he says, don't you.
All I have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts.
We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that?
Of course it matters. Hey, hold on!
I must be healthy, then, because I'm scared to death. I guess I'd better get back to Yorgi.
Yes, I do. You're right. I can't just let him go free. Besides, I can help you from the inside.
Where's he headed?
Where'd the damn truck go?!
Toadies right behind.
What was that for?
Hate those Russkie choppers. Rattle- trap pieces of garbage. I'm agent Shavers. Toby Lee Shavers. I'm looking for what's his name. Three X' s.
I'm having fun, what's the problem?
French Polynesia? This wouldn't last us a week in a cheap hotel. Do you know how expensive it is down there?
This is so typical. I can't believe you. I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? Are you out of your mind?
Dude, what are you doing here?
Sorry, "dude".
Who's writing this dude's dialogue?
Cops. Like a plague. No matter how many you pay there's always another with his hand out. How did you pick him out?
What's going on, my friend?
Total chaos, man! Welcome to Anarchy 99!
And you. Why do you have such a problem staying away, my friend? Did you miss us that much?
Including rape, pillage, murder.
What does that mean?
Thomas Edison knew how to make the light bulb.  He had the energy source. He had the vacuum.  But he didn't have the filament.  He tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to power.
Can the Professor repair his own mind?
What's wrong with him?
I'll tell you one thing though.
The Professor said you were a solider. Actually, I believe he used the word mercenary.
You should always work with a spotter.
I was thinking maybe you and me could go into town.
Logan, do you see this ring?
Ms. Grey -- you work at a school for mutants in Westchester, New York.  Can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants?
I'm sorry to come here, Ms. Grey.  I was afraid if I went to a hospital, they would...
You... wha... Who are you... Where is Henry?
Where am I?
What am I doing here?
Who?
I am trying to save our kind, Charles. You should do the same.
The two in Alaska.  Just how do you people manage to be in the right place at the right time?  Still tinkering with Cerebro?
You definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me, Max. What is it like these days?
The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?
What was your grandfather's name?
Give him an extra dollar.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, he was.  But he said he was obligated to lecture at Johns Hopkins University.
Herr Falkstein! You have your instructions!
You're incorrigible!... Aren't you?
Still happy you married me?
Love me oodles and oodles?
So this is what it's like to be completely happy!
Darling!
Surprised?
Will you miss me?
Mother's going to help me with the invitations.
I've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends...but it still comes to three thousand.
Love me?
Are you suggesting I call him master???
I suppose you're right.
I suppose you're right.
I hope you find this comfortable. This was Baron Victor's room.
You'll fine the keys to all the rooms in my cas... all the rooms in your castle on this ring.  I'll leave it on the table here.
Surely he kept his notes -- his private papers and records in some other place?
I don't think so.  Is my assistant taken care of?
What?
All right then, I suppose I owe the family that much.  You'll have everything ready for me when I arrive?
One week at the most!?
That's 'Fronkonsteen.'
But look at what's been done with hearts and kidneys!
You have more chance of re-animating this knife than you have of mending a broken nervous system,
Frederick Frankenstein?
Are you putting me on?
Are these your bags?
There.
Suit yourself...I'm easy.  Better watch out for the wockers.
It seems that way.  You didn't hear any music at all?
You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?
Taking the book along?
I want that brain.
Throw the second switch!
It's not enough.  More!  More, do you hear me?
Don't try to cheer me up that way.
You'll be getting me sad next.
Oh, do you like it?  I'm not partial to desserts, but this is excellent.
To you!  You just made a 'yummy' sound, so I thought you liked the dessert.
But don't you see...the brain of Hans Delbruck is inside this grotesque hulk -- pleading with us.  I've got to untie it.
Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
Yes, Master!
... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid...
I'm going to untie you -- can you understand that?
Get the sedative ready!
Nice!  Nice little balance to it.
Would you like a sandwich?
Inga, wake up!
Let me come with you, Doctor, please!  I don't want to stay up here alone.
Ooh!
Did you do it?
Good night, Doctor.
Why, doctor...how wonderful for you.
I know, but I mean -- not fooling around physically?... Or not fooling around intellectually?
It wouldn't be fair to Elizabeth.
His what??
I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?
How do you know they're done?
Three minutes to go!
Drink!
Foooooood!
From the Cook, Sir They saw me dip your shaving tin in the tea-water this morning, made their tea taste of Lifebuoy toilet soap, they saij Handing him the bottle of gin he purloined earlier. 2t
Why don 't the Zulus attack?
An historical moment, Gentlemen.
Tell what you see. Write it well, Sir, and make sure you get it right
What o'clock is it, Mr Noggs?
The only reports of enemy activity have come from the direction of the Royal Kraal, at Ulundi.
Splendid site, Crealock, splendil I want to establish Camp here immediately.
Stuart?
How quickly can you move your artillery forward?
Your orders, Mr Vereker?
